__label__Position	We need a national policy to set up community kitchens throughout the country
__label__Evidence	Cooked food may get wasted in case of the wrong estimation of hungry people in the area.
__label__Evidence	India ranked 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index, 2021. Many people in India are undernourished and are sleeping on an empty stomach. As the supreme court mentioned, it is the duty of the welfare state to ensure that all the citizens have food to eat. By establishing community kitchens throughout the country, we can ensure that everyone has access to nutritious food.
__label__Evidence	Due to the pandemic, many people lost jobs, especially those who are working in the informal sector. So, now community kitchens are more needed than ever.
__label__Evidence	Tonnes of food grains rot every year at the Food Corporation of India (FCI). By supplying the food grains to the community kitchen, the waste of food grains can be prevented, and instead that can be used to feed hungry people.
__label__Evidence	Many people, especially youngsters are willing to volunteer. But not many have access to volunteer options nearby. Once community kitchens are set up, many people will happily volunteer and will donate supplies too.

__label__Position	The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe
__label__Position	We should fight crony capitalism in India
__label__Evidence	Crony capitalists are able to get away with just about anything. They enjoy the full support of money and the government in all their endeavors. Their decisions may even cause the economy to suffer adversely.
__label__Evidence	Crony capitalists get an advantage over their competitors due to support from the government. Simple examples of the undue advantage they get may be in the form of easier loan sanctions, loan approvals despite adverse credit ratings, easier land acquisition, out-of-turn property registration, tender approvals without any past record of performance, etc. This ruins the reward system of the markets. A monopoly gets established in the markets which prevents new players from entering the markets. This leads to lesser entrepreneurial activity in the country. Decreased entrepreneurial activity leads to lesser job opportunities and borrowing.
__label__Evidence	Crony capitalism has led to India having the world’s worst non-performing loan ratio. Lenders gave away loans to unworthy entities over the years despite knowing their credit backgrounds. The current amount of bad debts is approximately equal to INR 9 lakh crore and is expected to increase by INR 2 Trillion next year. The banks are left with no other option but to take huge haircuts (sometimes even as high as 65%) on the loans recovered. Taxpayers' money is often used to bail out these banks in order to save the economy.
__label__Evidence	An atmosphere of decreased lending is created and, in turn, the economy gets slowed down. As can be seen in India, entrepreneurial activity is extremely low. Job opportunities are extremely low today. India is experiencing the highest levels of unemployment in the last 4 decades. The Indian economy has been posting 7%+ GDP repeatedly but yet the common people are suffering while the rich are getting richer.

__label__Evidence	urbanization leads to a loss of small town identities, unsightly urban skyscrapers, and a mass increase of pollution.
__label__Evidence	urbanization has everything nearby some those that can't travel far will have everything they need close to them
__label__Evidence	urbanization leaves rural communities impoverished. it should be stemmed so that rural areas continue to thrive and develop.
__label__Evidence	urbanization is bad for the enviornment
__label__Evidence	urbanization can bring much needed money to a city.
__label__Evidence	urbanization destroys farmland and hinders the agricultural industry.
__label__Evidence	the countryside, which is threatened by urbanization, must be protected at all costs
__label__Evidence	increasing urbanization can have negative impacts on the natural enviroment
__label__Evidence	there will be less sprawl when everyone is living in one area which will preserve a lot of natural ecosystems
__label__Evidence	urbanization increases pollution and congestion in cities.
__label__Evidence	services and resources can be better managed in an urban setting.
__label__Evidence	urbanization makes environmental sense as concentrated resources can be be used efficiently by more people.
__label__Evidence	we should fight urbanization because it causes more air pollution than there already is
__label__Evidence	urban centers make it easier for people to find jobs and get around in a city where everything they need is close by.
__label__Evidence	"urbanization is more efficient and ""green"" due to a more organized and proximitous infrastructure."
__label__Evidence	urbanization also creates job opportunities for many people as well as housing.
__label__Evidence	urbanization allows basic services such as healthcare and education to be much more readily available than in rural areas
__label__Evidence	urbanization is leading to overpopulation in the cities
__label__Evidence	urbanization packs more people into smaller spaces causing more crime, pollution and diseases.
__label__Evidence	urbanization is the threat to our planet.
__label__Position	The EU should join NATO
__label__Position	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI
__label__Evidence	Drones are being used in many industries. They go to places where it is difficult for humans to go. For example, they can be used to deliver medicines quickly in hilly regions. Drones can be used to deliver food in times of natural calamities. Not just delivering food, using drones, rescue teams can find people that are stuck and can save them. So, drones can save lives.
__label__Evidence	Drones can be misused to stalk, vandalize homes, and for doing many other anti-social activities. There have been many incidents, where drones posed security threats.
__label__Position	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__Evidence	You owe the fact that you can drink your coffee in public to the people who got vaccinated and thus made the virus a little more manageable.
__label__Evidence	In addition to production and shipping, the score should also reflect the impact of the product's disposal. For example if the product requires to apply many different (toxic) chemicals for recycling, this should result in a worse score.
__label__Evidence	Yes, but the problem is: Just because a product can be recycled, it does not mean that it always will be recycled. Let's assume that there would be a really climate friendly way to recycle batteries. Still people could throw those into landfills. How does the score deal with this?
__label__Position	We should fight against urbanization
__label__Evidence	Urbanization results in increased population density, which leads to pressure on resources such as land, water, medical professionals, and police.
__label__Evidence	As more people keep coming to urban areas, there will be more supply of human resources than demand, hence the wages will decrease. Hence many people work so hard for a meager income.
__label__Evidence	More population causes a burden on the government and hence it will be difficult to ensure the quality of life for all.
__label__Evidence	Due to high demand, land prices, housing prices, and rents will increase drastically. Not everyone can afford the prices. Those who can afford to have to spend a large part of their income on housing. The people who cannot afford to rent in urban areas are forced to live in slums with substandard housing and poor sanitation facilities, which negatively affects the health of people living there.
__label__Position	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries
__label__Position	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India
__label__Evidence	NGOs are often America's way of interfering in European elections. NGOs must be policed more vigilantly to prevent America from interfering in our elections.
__label__Position	We should encourage people to take part in Fit India Movement
__label__Position	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__Position	We should subsidize student loans
__label__Position	We should make healthy food cheaper than unhealthy food
__label__Evidence	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.
__label__Position	We should have legal migration channels.
__label__Evidence	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.
__label__Evidence	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.
__label__Evidence	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights.
__label__Evidence	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell.
__label__Evidence	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.
__label__Evidence	Immigrants cannot work because they don't speak the required language.

__label__Evidence	No person should really earn an income from owning land itself, because it is not the result of human labor. Planet Earth is the common inheritance of humanity, why should any human have the right to take a piece of ground and demand payment from someone else for the privilege of using it? The land exists independently of the land owner.
__label__Evidence	A land tax would eliminate land speculation because the increase in ground rent would go away in tax.
__label__Evidence	Space mining may be neat science fiction, but I doubt it could ever become a commercially feasible activity. Aside from the environmental impact of launching vehicles into space, moving the mined materials to Earth would pose its own challenges. Entry into the atmosphere and arrival on Earth is dangerous. Having thousands of tons of mined matter go through this process seems destined to end up with frequent disasters.
__label__Evidence	In the hope of becoming rich, many people are burning money to buy overhyped digital art. Many will lose money when people lose interest in buying these NFTs. Some people are saying that NFTs are a bubble that is going to burst.
__label__Evidence	NFTs help artists sell their paintings, music, etc. for a good amount of money, which may not be possible before NFTs.
__label__Evidence	Whenever an NFT was sold or bought, the transaction consumes lots of electricity. This huge energy consumption is a serious issue because we are already fighting against climate change.
__label__Evidence	Hackers are stealing NFTs. And they are also stealing cryptocurrencies by sending malicious NFTs. Recently, hackers stole $150k worth of crypto from Twitch co-founder’s Fractal NFT project.
__label__Position	The EU leadership must enter into strong agreements with the countries where immigrants come from, in order to retain them in their countries
__label__Evidence	Instead of banning anything, we should create better alternatives. When the high-speed rail line (320 km/h) between Strasbourg and Paris was opened, the number of flights between Stuttgart and Paris dropped dramatically, due to decreasing demand.
__label__Evidence	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result.
__label__Evidence	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.
__label__Evidence	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.

__label__Position	We should stop the development of autonomous cars
__label__Position	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__Evidence	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.
__label__Evidence	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research. This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic. These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.
__label__Position	Europe should have stronger borders
__label__Position	The EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey.
__label__Position	We should protect 20% of land in each European country to restore biodiversity
__label__Position	Rapists should be tortured
__label__Evidence	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.
__label__Evidence	Waste produces negative environmental impacts in the recipient state.
__label__Evidence	Exported trash is burning for months suffocating local people and wildlife.
__label__Evidence	Exported trash is often flushed to the sea by rain, thus polluting rivers on the go.
__label__Evidence	Where do you think should be stored nuclear/radioactive waste please? Stored in glaciers will be problem (with melting etc.).
__label__Evidence	The broadcasting license on the European level can enable the creation of media champions that will be able to compete with media champions in other parts of the world (CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera...)
__label__Evidence	The broadcasting license on the European level can project European soft power beyond its borders.
__label__Evidence	The broadcasting license on the European level can help avoid misinformation, meddling, and foreign influence more than smaller networks, which would ensure a better quality of the content.
__label__Evidence	The broadcasting license on the European level will unite European markets for film and music.
__label__Evidence	A common broadcasting license would have an effect on the EU countries experiencing democratic backsliding
__label__Evidence	Children are made to work in industries with hazardous chemicals, and machines under harsh weather conditions, resulting in physical casualties and many severe diseases.
__label__Evidence	Due to a lack of education and proper guidance, they get influenced by criminals and take shortcuts to become rich, and end up committing crimes at a tender age. The rates of juvenile crime cases are increasing day by day in India.
__label__Evidence	The number of harassment and child abuse cases has drastically increased in the last few years most of them are sexual abuse cases occurring with girls and boys aged below 15.
__label__Evidence	Childhood is the most important phase for the development of physical and emotional abilities. The problem of child labor is stealing childhood from many children. Mere making laws to prevent it doesn’t solve the problem. Implementation of the laws on a war footing is needed.
__label__Position	We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users
__label__Position	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Evidence	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive.
__label__Evidence	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years.
__label__Evidence	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.
__label__Evidence	Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature. Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose. Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).
__label__Evidence	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now.
__label__Position	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.
__label__Position	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness
__label__Position	We should end animal abuse
__label__Evidence	Feeding or dressing man is no longer an acceptable excuse with the state of knowledge of the “modern” world.
__label__Position	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.
__label__Evidence	There is little or no educational, conservational, research, or economic benefit derived from wild animals in traditional circuses that might justify their use and the loss of their ability to behave naturally as wild animals.
__label__Evidence	In circuses, wild animals in circuses are destined to a life of physical abuse and mental torture.
__label__Evidence	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts.
__label__Evidence	Circuses are traveling entertainment services moving around Europe, and performing wild animals are transported across Member States, where circuses pose a severe public safety threat.
__label__Evidence	As women face violence because of their gender, they need special laws to protect them. But, in general, men do not face physical harassment just because of their gender.
__label__Evidence	In India, it is very difficult for women to go to police stations to report crimes against them. Men’s commission may further deter them from approaching courts.
__label__Evidence	If a woman is a victim of any sort of harassment and is in a distress, society will more likely to help her. But the same is not true for men. If a man is a victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment, there is no single government entity he can approach to. Moreover, society may make fun of him for being weak. This is the reason married men are twice likely to commit suicide when compared to married women. To address these gender stereotypes and discrimination, there is a need for 'National commission for Men'.
__label__Evidence	As per the 2011 census, India has a 51.47% male population. India has a 'Ministry for women & child development', but none of the government entities is working on men’s rights. As India is a democratic country, it is unfair to neglect people based on their gender.
__label__Evidence	With better and more stringent mechanisms and laws in place to deal with sexual harassment, rape cases, and domestic violence cases, unfortunately, there have been instances of misuse of the laws to cause harm to innocent men. Setting up a Ministry of Men would at least give such men a chance to make their case. This, in no way, is meant to undermine the case for the protection of women.
__label__Evidence	It has been observed that in countries where the sex ratio is skewed against women, crimes against women increase drastically. As can be easily seen in India, crimes against women have been on the rise. Most horrific of all, crimes against minor girls have increased drastically since 2012. This paints a very grim picture of our society as a whole. The highest GDP growth rate amounts to nothing if our society itself is corrupted to the extent that it is right now. India has been a patriarchal society for centuries. To make a shift to an egalitarian society for women in every aspect of life, Indian men need to be re-educated and rehabilitated with the new norms.
__label__Evidence	Drug addiction is a menace that has plagued Indian youth in recent years. The majority of drug addicts are males. A ministry of men can help solve the problem of why capable male youth of the country are resorting to such self-destructive activities.

__label__Evidence	there are some crimes, like terrorism, where it is just expedient.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling targets minorities whether they actually committed these crimes or not.

__label__Evidence	it is raciest and has no place in todays society.
__label__Evidence	no one should be thought to be suspicious just because of their race or color.
__label__Evidence	Law-abiding citizens in groups that are racially profiled against may be unwilling to cooperate with law enforcement.
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling is legal in certain cases, such as in cases of immigration.
__label__Evidence	it is a fact that race, however distasteful this is, is often a predisposition to crime. we should work to change that but whilst it is a fact, must use that intelligence to protect the whole
__label__Evidence	there is no reason to use this ancient belief process, and we unfairly assign negative aspects to a group of people that do not deserve it.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling is indiscriminatory and it should end
__label__Evidence	racial profiling is necessary to keep our country safe from its enemies.
__label__Evidence	we should end racial profiling because it is racist and doesn't actually do anything to lower crimes
__label__Evidence	racial profiling can be more misleading than accurate and can discriminate against minority groups
__label__Evidence	there are certain races that commit certain crimes. it's just a fact. by allowing racial profiling you are allowing law enforcement to solve crimes faster than by assuming anyone could have done it.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling does nothing but permits law enforcement to commit legalized racism.
__label__Evidence	making a decision on race alone is pure racism
__label__Evidence	racial and ethnic discrimination occurs on a daily basis while preventing the progress of millions of people around the world
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling makes the people being profiled feel unsafe and afraid.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling shouldn't be banned because it offers the potential of stopping a crime
__label__Evidence	racial profiling serves no purpose because you are stereotyping a population.
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling forces people into a life of crime by treating them like a criminal regardless of whether they have committed a crime.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling is an act of institutionalized racism and should be abolished right now
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling helps law enforcement and Homeland Security recognize threats sooner and keep the country safer.
__label__Evidence	having racial profiling is improving in countries statistic and nothing wrong with that.
__label__Evidence	in certain situations, for example airports, racial profiling is necessary and effective for determining high risk members of the public, to ensure the safety of others
__label__Evidence	racial profiling is one form of profiling and when combined with others is effective
__label__Evidence	racial profiling is discrimination and not right
__label__Evidence	racial profiling violates equal rights.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling has been proven to be useful, as certain groups of people are more likely to commit particular crimes
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling can be used for reparative justice and reparations.
__label__Evidence	we should not end racial prfiling because it helps the police get the bad guys
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling is the most efficient way to stop crimes and terrorism.
__label__Evidence	we should not end racial profiling because there will always be classifications that have higher trust statistics.
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling is dangerous as too many innocent people are targeted just because of their race.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling can help lead to terrorist activities due to certain groups originating in a certain region
__label__Evidence	in some areas, certain races are more likely to commit crimes and therefore it helps the police to have a profile to watch out for.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling should be illegal because it isn't right to discriminate against someone because of their race.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling is an ample indicator of supposed crimes.
__label__Evidence	we should end it because it oppresses certain races and society will never be able to move on as a whole if we carry on doing this.
__label__Evidence	it categorically wrong and prejudicial to single people out based on race.
__label__Evidence	it should be allowed to help deal with crime from certain types of people.
__label__Evidence	it is easier to find criminals if authorities can narrow down what ethnicity of person to look for along with other distinguishing features.
__label__Evidence	It is immoral to target a particular group based simply on their race of ethnicity.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't end racial profiling because it is a way to stop criminals before they commit crimes
__label__Evidence	racial profiling distracts law enforcement agencies from more useful approaches and it prevents police from serving the entire community and also prevents communities from working with the police.
__label__Evidence	statistics show that crimes are committed by certain types of people, so law enforcement should target those people and watch them closer. it makes perfect sense.
__label__Evidence	we should not base suspicions on the color of skin, sex, religion. this is discrimination
__label__Evidence	racial profiling is useful to monitor what is happening in society and so we should keep it.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling is discriminatory and humiliating and against one's constitutional rights.
__label__Evidence	we should definitely end racial profiling because every individual should be judged on their character alone.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling only serves to fuel discrimination and racial resentment.
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling discriminates minorities unfairly, causing feelings of shame and anger that can in themselves cause violence and hate.
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling is effective. Potential criminals can be stopped before they commit a crime.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling suggests that all people of a skin color have similar traits. but it is not the color of the skin that suggests violence, intelligence, attitude, tastes. do not base judgments on pass ideas.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling is necessary when you know for a fact that a person of a certain race has committed a crime.
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling is an ineffective strategy for ensuring public safety.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling should not be allowed as it simply causes innocent people to seem to be guilty because of the actions of a few

__label__Evidence	racial profiling is rights violative and racist towards minorities who do no wrong
__label__Evidence	Racial profiling creates distrust between people of color and police.

__label__Evidence	we should end racial profiling because we are attempting to create an all are equal country and this just stirs the pot.
__label__Evidence	racial profiling impigns the rights of the innocent.
__label__Position	We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir
__label__Evidence	As per Article 370, people of other regions cannot buy land or settle in Jammu & Kashmir. This is acting against the development of the region. By abolishing article 370, teachers, doctors, and other professionals can settle there bringing better facilities. And also industries can be set up in the region and hence Jammu & Kashmir can be economically developed.
__label__Evidence	By abolishing this article, the government can act tough against the terrorism present in the region.
__label__Evidence	Many laws such as The prohibition of the Child Marriage Act, and women’s reservations were not applicable to Jammu & Kashmir, because of the provisions of Article 370. All laws of India should also be applicable to J&K.
__label__Evidence	People of J&K have a feeling that settlers from other regions will change the demography of the region. So, due to the abolition of article 370, they may protest against the central government.
__label__Evidence	Citizens of Jammu & Kashmir are facing so much struggle because of many reasons such as the fight between India and Pakistan, the constant presence of troops, the unemployment crisis, etc. So if the special status is also removed, they may feel like their voice is suppressed.
__label__Evidence	We were champions of hockey even when we were not independent. We have won Olympic 8 gold medals in Hockey, the highest in any sport. We had a glorious past, and we should work towards restoring it. Making cricket a national game may overshadow hockey.
__label__Evidence	Apart from the raw passion, the money and fame that follows are blinding. Unlike other players of other sports, the cricketers even at the junior levels earn handsomely, which is also a motivating factor that this game ensures financial security provided you play well.
__label__Evidence	India has been performing outstandingly well in cricket for the past 20 years or so. It is the most popular sport in India. Children are madly passionate about it, people are deeply involved in the game, and there is a cricket critic in every Indian house. The BCCI has been successful in brilliantly marketing and encouraging the game as well. BCCI is the richest cricket board in the world and the richest sports controlling authority in India. No sports authority has managed their game so well in India as compared to BCCI. We have won 3 World Cups, 2 Champion Trophies, and many more prestigious tournaments.
__label__Evidence	Cricket basically originated in England and gained popularity in colonial countries as the English masters used to play. The fine Englishmen used to bat all day and the tiring bowling work was done by the locals of the colonies. This game is a sign of the presence of colonialism.
__label__Evidence	e-coins can be easily blocked, erased, or stolen.
__label__Evidence	Cryptocurrencies are causing massive damage to the environment due to large energy consumption.
__label__Evidence	all these alternations of Bitcoin are copies of the one Ponzi scheme - you pay for 'fiat' as these e-coins are backed only by the faith of e-believers willing to own it
__label__Evidence	the second EU starts banning cryptocurrencies, it will start getting compared to totalitarian regimes (even more than now).
__label__Evidence	everyone should have a right to own cryptocurrency.

__label__Position	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.
__label__Position	We should prohibit internal combustion engines
__label__Evidence	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.
__label__Evidence	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.
__label__Position	We should be aware of migration due to climate change
__label__Evidence	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!
__label__Evidence	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them. We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.

__label__Evidence	All of Europe has to pay income tax & VAT, except for the Eurocrats. In Belgium, you have to pay 50 % of your salary to the state, unless you work directly for the EU. Is this fair? No, of course not! It is time to make Europe fairer in a very practical and direct way, by abolishing tax exemptions for European politicians and staff.
__label__Evidence	It is absolutely ridiculous to be spending money on these climate disastrous practices. The EU is nowhere close to keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement and is still funding unsustainable practices left and right.
__label__Evidence	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model.
__label__Position	The Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept.
__label__Position	Consumerism brings more harm than good
__label__Position	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.' The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.
__label__Position	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms
__label__Position	We should create a common constitution
__label__Evidence	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions. We have the perfectly fine EU Treaties as the foundational documents of the EU. They must be followed to the letter.
__label__Position	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Evidence	Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress.
__label__Evidence	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.
__label__Evidence	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.
__label__Evidence	Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again.
__label__Evidence	We should focus more on human welfare. Currently, waste sorting and recycling are degrading human exploitation in sweatshops.
__label__Evidence	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels.
__label__Evidence	giving nuclear energy a green label will encourage the flow of financial resources across the EU toward environmentally sustainable activities
__label__Evidence	Nuclear energy can be considered sustainable because it is cheap and can be predicted for decades, and the price of power produced by nuclear power plants is not affected by changes in the price of natural gas or other energy carriers.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear energy use helps to avoid the release of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants every year, which contribute to the development of acid rain, smog, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.
__label__Position	Every human has the right to receive reliable information about the movement and distribution of public funds
__label__Position	We should abolish the three-strikes laws
__label__Position	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Evidence	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps?
__label__Evidence	If Europe is going to have concentration camps again, they should be in Europe, in plain sight, for everyone to see.
__label__Evidence	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.
__label__Evidence	Setting up inhumane camps by bribing local warlords is not the right way.
__label__Evidence	Agree. If the asylum seekers don't have to cross the Mediterranean to apply for it less of them will die trying and less human trafficking will take place.
__label__Evidence	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.
__label__Evidence	Good idea. These camps can be managed by the UN. The EU can send illegal immigrants to these camps. So they will not be on EU soil. From the camps they still can apply for asylum.
__label__Position	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Evidence	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop, With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today.
__label__Evidence	I highly support this. As Jonathan Foer puts it in his book 'We are the weather': Changing our diet will not suffice to save the planet, but we won't save it unless we eat differently.
__label__Evidence	I understand your point and its importance, but as long as I have fangs in my mouth I will want to eat meat (like most people). You'd be better off suggesting more research into food printers.
__label__Evidence	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact.
__label__Evidence	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability. It only requires a person's higher capacity to be compassionate, respectful and most of all dedicated to our environment's needs. Who wouldn't want such qualities to become our society's norm?
__label__Evidence	Even if you believe you are unable to follow a plant-based lifestyle you must appreciate the effectiveness and dedication to the environment of those individuals who do.
__label__Evidence	There is no reason other than egotism to be against such a proposal.
__label__Position	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality
__label__Evidence	naturopathy is very dangerous for the most vulnerable people, like children and cancer patients. people use ineffective treatments and forgo proven cures, such as antibiotics or chemo, often resulting in death.
__label__Evidence	once eradicated illnesses are returning due to people turning to naturopathy.
__label__Evidence	naturopathy is a scam that preys on vulnerable people. people end up paying a lot of money for something that does not work and does not improve their health.
__label__Evidence	studies have shown that naturopathic medicine is safe and by adding naturopathic care to conventional care patients have better overall health outcomes
__label__Evidence	naturopathy is just a con, charging people a lot of money for so-called naturopathic medicines that have no proven benefits.
__label__Evidence	there is no scientific evidence that shows naturopathy works
__label__Evidence	we need to ban this because there is little evidence that these remedies work and can be very dangerous when people refuse conventional medicine for serious ailments.
__label__Evidence	neuropathy treats many highly dangerous diseases
__label__Evidence	naturopathy doesn't rely on facts to treat illnesses.
__label__Evidence	it can cause more harm rather than help
__label__Evidence	we should not ban naturopathy because many natural was of doing things often bring the same result as taking medicines except without the side effects of the medicines.
__label__Evidence	it does not work and it gives people false hope when they should be getting real treatment.
__label__Evidence	We should ban naturopathy because naturopathy does not appear to be science-based nor evidence-based and is grounded in an unscientific belief system
__label__Evidence	because naturopathy uses more natural ingredients it is better for you
__label__Evidence	"We should not let the profit driven ""Big Pharma"" control how we treat ourselves, Naturopathy has been here long before them."
__label__Evidence	naturopathy is just a scam that has no scientific backing. people that could truly be helped with medicine that choose naturopathy will suffer undue harm.
__label__Evidence	Naturopathy expands the field of medicine, creating more research and discourse.
__label__Evidence	naturopathy has no scientific evidence to back it up its claims of effectiveness,in fact, many studies show it can have a harmful effect.
__label__Evidence	Naturopathic medicine dosages can be dangerous because doctors cannot manage them.

__label__Evidence	naturopathy lets any person act like they are an doctor which is very misleading.
__label__Evidence	naturopathy can help people with allergies to chemical based medication.
__label__Evidence	natural medicine is proven safe and no side effects.
__label__Evidence	Naturopaths preclude individuals from seeking efficacious treatment by lying to them about the effects of naturopathic treatment. For more serious diseases like cancer, the ointments and diet changes don't work and this results in death.
__label__Evidence	there has not been enough research to guarantee it even works
__label__Evidence	people that are ill should be able to take whatever measures they want to, in order to feel better, even if it is only mental benefits.
__label__Evidence	naturopathy, while a healthy way of living itself, is not a reasonable way to cure anything.
__label__Evidence	naturopathy is simply a natural alternative to typical medicine, and in some cases, is better tolerated than conventional medicine.
__label__Evidence	most illnesses are caused by the lifestyle we lead. naturopathy gets out bodies back to the way they need to be to fight these illnesses and become more healthy.

__label__Evidence	it has been proven to work and is safer than drugs, etc. and is more affordable.
__label__Evidence	naturopathy is natural, therefore, its good for us.
__label__Evidence	the medical community is gradually accepting that there is evidence that naturopathy is helping people so it should not be banned for fear of missing better treatments and outcomes.
__label__Evidence	naturopathy has not been tested for effectiveness
__label__Evidence	it needs to be regulated or it could harm people
__label__Evidence	it's a cheaper option for people that can't afford healthcare to still feel better.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban naturopathy because some people don't believe in doctors because of religious believes and so naturopathy is better than nothing
__label__Evidence	naturopathy can provide symptomatic relief without side effects

__label__Evidence	naturopathy should not be banned as it as proven to be a cheaper and natural way to treat a condition.

__label__Evidence	i believe naturopathy should definitely be banned. this way of healing is unproven, untested and can be extremely dangerous to the people using them. use what we know.

__label__Evidence	there is little evidence or research to say that naturotherapy is effective

__label__Evidence	we should subsidize stay-at-home dads because with them staying home, they more and likely would not have the same income level had the wife stayed at home since income equality still exists.
__label__Evidence	The suggestion that men deserve payment for what has traditionally been women's unpaid work is problematic; it sends the message that only men's labor has value.
__label__Evidence	We should subsidize stay at home dads since it's so important for kids to have a father figure in their lives. Dads could be with their children and still have money to help live on.
__label__Evidence	stay at home dads allow mothers to have a career.
__label__Evidence	it is their choice to stay at home rather than go to work so why should the tax payer pay for this?
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize stay-at-home dads since there are other more important issues that should be getting subsidized
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize stay-at-home dads because women usually don't make equal pay to the man so it would help make up the difference lacking in the wife's salary.
__label__Evidence	staying at home is a choice since they know they won't be getting an income
__label__Evidence	dads who stay home provide a great asset in the raising of future generations of children. therefore, subsidies should be given to them to help them continue in their family endeavors.
__label__Evidence	dads who choose to stay home are taking away resources from the potential workforce. this could hurt a nation's economy and make the future less promising for younger generations.
__label__Evidence	stay-at-home dads allows for the partner to be able to continue employment, much helped if the partner is in a position that provides for the family financially as well as other benefits.
__label__Evidence	the state can not add to its cats a subsidy to unemployed parents because it would damage society by causing the family to stop working and dedicate themselves to procreate
__label__Evidence	we cannot subsidize stay-at-home dads because there are numerous other issues that need funding like space exploration, health care, clean water, and feeding the world's hungry
__label__Evidence	they have exactly nine months to prepare for it so any subsidizing in stay-at-home dads is just wrong.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing stay at home dads would help alleviate financial burdens on a lot of families
__label__Evidence	Stay at home dads do just as much work for taking care of the babies as stay at home moms and should be subsidized.
__label__Evidence	stay at home dad's chose to be parents. no other citizen should pay to subsidize their lifestyle choice, especially the many citizens that have not had children of their own because they cannot afford to
__label__Evidence	the state does not choose when parents try for children and it is the individual responsibility of the parents to make sensible choices that they can afford and it's not the state's place to fund their choices
__label__Evidence	women have been staying home with children and have not been subsidized so men should be able to as well.

__label__Evidence	we can't provide aide for everyone due to personal situations and stay at home dads are no exception.
__label__Evidence	public funds can be used more effectively for needs that the entire population faces such as education, housing and the climate crisis.
__label__Evidence	employers can't afford to do this its hard enough new mums have time off

__label__Evidence	The residents get to have a community of their own. They can interact, make friends and enjoy themselves together.

__label__Position	We should protect bird habitats in built environments
__label__Position	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__Position	We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states
__label__Evidence	'Fair' taxation is a vague concept. Taxes are complex and countries want to avoid double taxation. Countries should be able to set their own taxes in a way that matches their spending and the needs of their citizens. I am against global taxes and against double taxation.
__label__Evidence	Today we live in a system where our public healthcare system is organized on a for-profit healthcare system, where we develop knowledge through taxpayer institutions and then let companies patent this knowledge for profit this has to change, we shouldn't let the greed of capitalists extort us, the EU should work to DISMANTLE all patents and make healthcare issues for all. The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now.
__label__Evidence	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this.
__label__Position	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately, vaccination has shown that it is unable to curb the contagion and therefore the spread of COVID-19.

__label__Position	Gas and nuclear power should be supported with money from European countries
__label__Position	The EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe.
__label__Evidence	The technology-enabled economy of abundance without human exploitation you can endorse it. We should not hamper automation, instead, we should rethink morals about work. Let the robots do all the bad jobs and let human beings be free to pursue a creative and meaningful life

__label__Evidence	You should endorse the creation of the European Army to defend the interests of European countries, fight against trafficking (humans, drugs, etc.), and be used as the arm of genuine European diplomacy.
__label__Position	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__Evidence	The rule of law varies from country to country, due to the fact that the concept developed in each country under the influence of local traditions. It's impossible, and superfluous to develop a uniform, EU-standard conception of the rule of law.
__label__Position	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency

__label__Position	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform
__label__Evidence	It would be a better idea to abolish the European Parliament. It has become an ideological Kabuki Theatre. The Commission should be entirely under the control of the sovereign member states, of course, who remain the masters of the treaties.
__label__Evidence	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council. We have seen this many times when the EU-MS have tried to find a common stance on foreign policy issues but one has been able to deter the will of all the other countries. This is not a democratic way. The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election.
__label__Evidence	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.

__label__Evidence	Microplastics are everywhere nowadays: in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. It is said that we consume a credit card's worth of plastics every week. This must stop before we consume an apple's worth of plastics every week.
__label__Evidence	Not many consumers are aware of how many of their products contain microplastics because producers deliberately hide this fact by only referring to the chemical names of microplastics on labels.

__label__Position	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Position	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness
__label__Position	We should abolish the Olympic Games
__label__Evidence	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
__label__Evidence	I think it is extremely important to upgrade our relations with the former Eastern European countries and in that way move us in the right direction. It is now they need us the most. The area around the Black Sea has enormous potential. They have a growth zone that moves from western Europe to the east and at the same time a growth zone that moves from south China to the north.
__label__Position	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat
__label__Position	Betting and gambling should be legalized in India
__label__Evidence	Initially, India faced issues such as vaccine shortage, lack of availability of vaccines in remote places, etc. But now after solving all these challenges, the main challenge now is to vaccinate those who do not want to be vaccinated. So, by enforcing legal measures such as compulsory vaccination, we can achieve 100% vaccination. The government can help them in dealing with their fears by keeping them for a longer time in vaccination centers while having a medical team by their side.
__label__Evidence	If the world did not achieve 100% vaccination, a lot of new variants will be created. So, it is important to vaccinate all to reduce the possibility of new strains.
__label__Evidence	Many people are not taking vaccination due to the rumors that are being spread by anti-vaxxers using social media. Taking action against these rumor creators is much better for improving the vaccination rate rather than enforcing compulsory vaccination.
__label__Evidence	Widespread awareness campaigns involving local people can help in overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Innovative and creative advertisements can encourage people to take the vaccination. These methods will be much more effective than legal measures.
__label__Evidence	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.

__label__Evidence	What does it mean to have a mere CO2eq. indicator? That's utter nonsense as there are many more impact categories.
__label__Position	We should ban kids' reality shows
__label__Evidence	This way all EU countries have access to a single database which will reduce paperwork and registration and provide immediate and informed service without the risk of complications, especially in regard to medical history.
__label__Evidence	The EU Database should be made accessible for health studies and prevention in order to establish a European Basic Health care industry to overcome future pandemics.
__label__Evidence	No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly. Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this.

__label__Evidence	it is inhumane and there is no oversight over how it is run.

__label__Evidence	guantanamo bay has been there for years and closing it now seems pointless when it's still being used.
__label__Evidence	We should not close Guantanamo Bay detection camp as there is still real and present danger from the detainees who should be allowed back in circulation either in free society or other prisons.

__label__Evidence	Guantanamo Bay is hardly used since 9/11 and is costing the government money.
__label__Evidence	using guantanamo bay as a detention camp is no longer necessary. it is expensive and most of the prisoners can be housed in federal prisons in the states.

__label__Evidence	closing the camp would lead to more humane pathways to justice on both sides.
__label__Evidence	we should close guantanamo bay detention camp because it violate human rights
__label__Evidence	the history of torture at guantanamo bay damages our reputation as a nation so it should be closed

__label__Evidence	the prisoners held at guantanamo bay are the biggest threat to the world and must be detained and dealt with in a completely different way than the rest of the population for our safety
__label__Evidence	guantanamo bay has given the us governement unprecidented abuse of power in detaining and torturing captive prisoners. it is inhumane and not a signal of an enlightened society.

__label__Evidence	guantanamo bay maintains terrorists that are a threat to the united states and keep foreign prisoners so as they are not returned to their countries to commit continued acts of terrorism.
__label__Evidence	we should close gauntanamo bay detention camp because it is a costly way of holding just a few inmates.

__label__Evidence	usa must have a detention center for criminals who attempt against national security and must be outside our territory
__label__Evidence	Guantanamo is unpopular, making it an undemocratic form of government policy.
__label__Evidence	keeping terrorist and criminal contained allows the government to collect information and prevent terrorist attacks.
__label__Evidence	guantanamo is a violation of the sovereignty of cuba and must be closed
__label__Evidence	these terrorists are those most willing to organize and carry out attacks and pose a danger to any civilization that they infiltrate.
__label__Evidence	we should close guantanamo bay detection camp because it has been reported that many prisoners have been tortured.
__label__Evidence	it is necessary to keep terrorists in a place where they are able to be questioned and are in a secure location
__label__Evidence	the guantanomo bay camp should be closed as people are kept there without fair trials
__label__Evidence	guantanamo bay detection camp should be closed because it allows inhumane treatment
__label__Evidence	although sometimes considered a brutal place, suspected terrorists can be questioned somewhere they can't possibly escape from or be rescued from, potentially opening up new lines of investigation.
__label__Evidence	By violating the human rights of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. loses its authority to request from other countries to stop their human rights violations.
__label__Evidence	we need guantanamo bay to deter terrorism and let them know we are serious about stopping it
__label__Evidence	it is costing taxpayers millions of dollars to keep it open.
__label__Evidence	keeping suspected terrorists in a jail that close to american soil is frightening; they should be placed in a more desolate camp, further away from the country.
__label__Evidence	guantanamo bay is known for its unfair treatment of its prisoners and should be closed.
__label__Evidence	There have been many human rights violations at Guantanamo Bay, including torturous interrogation techniques to obtain information.
__label__Evidence	Indefinite detention and torture completely undermine the standards of decency and justice that make America a country worth working for.
__label__Evidence	nobody wants foreign terrorists detained in their neighborhood
__label__Evidence	we need to find a place to house dangerous guantanamo inmates before we can close the camp.
__label__Evidence	guantanamo bay detection camp houses prisioners that it would not be safe to move
__label__Evidence	the torture in guantanamo bay are inhumane and awful. these people should be facing a judge and jury for their crimes. if you want info out of them give them less prison time. torture is not the answer.
__label__Evidence	there is no reason to have a prison in a foreign country. there is no reason to continue to place people in cuba some without even being charged. if this is needed have it in the us.
__label__Evidence	the camp keeps prisoners separated from the rest of society and is therefore essential for the worst of prisoners.
__label__Evidence	Guantanamo Bay detention camp uses questionable tactics to get information from prisoners.
__label__Evidence	it keeps all the dangerous criminals away from the society
__label__Evidence	the camp should remain open and it keep society safe
__label__Evidence	its outdated and serves little purpose.
__label__Evidence	the camp would be a good place for tours which could bring money in for the country.
__label__Evidence	we cannot just release all of the prisoners to close the facility.
__label__Evidence	too many people have been imprisoned on guantanamo bay unfairly as they were subsequently released without charge.
__label__Evidence	guantanamo bay has been useful in extracting information from enemy combatants and should not be closed.
__label__Evidence	due to the multiple criticisms regarding torture, the guantanamo bay should not be closed but measures should be implemented for the reinsertion of the prisoners into society
__label__Evidence	We should not close Guantanamo Bay detection camp as the prisoners there are still potentially dangerous to society.
__label__Evidence	prisoners are held at guantanamo bay camp without fair trial or representation, this camp violates human rights and must be closed as soon as possible.
__label__Evidence	guantanamo bay detection camp offers an essential form of law enforcement and imprisonment for serious criminals and has provided important intelligence in ongoing surveillance.
__label__Evidence	prisoners are tortured beyond reasons there and it's a human right's violation
__label__Evidence	it houses some very dangerous criminals who should not be allowed into the country
__label__Evidence	Guantanamo can provide security for accused terrorists who would be hurt in the general prison population.
__label__Evidence	Imprisonment in Guantanamo is punishment without a trial, which is unconstitutional.
__label__Evidence	it's a great place to keep terrorist suspects away from the general population keeping us all safer while they are under investigation.
__label__Position	Women are better managers than men
__label__Evidence	There has to be a general awareness that the real price of throw-away products and mass-produced foods is paid in the long run and that continuing down the current path will lead to more problems than having to adjust one's consumer behavior.
__label__Evidence	The idea of a circular economy could help us to tackle the problem of overconsumption and overproduction of waste.
__label__Evidence	such an approach to be successful must be implemented in each EU country to have visible results and help change the habits of both EU citizens and the private sector. And it has to be long-term promoted and funded. Can we do it?
__label__Evidence	Education is key. School curricula could help have more responsible consumption.
__label__Evidence	The national governments with the help of the EU should be able to set up “taxes” or “rewards” as in Sweden or Denmark to encourage citizens to recycle.
__label__Evidence	Print media is more trustworthy because once the news is published, it cannot be modified or deleted. Whereas in digital media, we can modify or delete the contents. So, those who run the newspapers and magazines will be extra careful while publishing the news or articles. Hence, print media is more trustworthy than digital media.
__label__Evidence	It is not eco-friendly, since print media requires paper that is harvested from trees.
__label__Evidence	Print media is just one-way communication. It gives information to the public, but consumers cannot share their opinions. Even though some newspapers publish readers’ mails, it is not user-friendly.
__label__Evidence	Print media cannot target a specific audience, whereas digital media can show different ads to a different type of audience and thereby can generate more revenue.
__label__Evidence	Several online news websites are bringing their print versions to reach more consumers and establish credibility.
__label__Evidence	Print media is not helpful for some people with disabilities, whereas digital media has accessibility options in general. For example, digital media helps people with visual impairment by providing audio versions of the content.
__label__Evidence	When we read newspapers, there will be no distractions and hence we can totally focus on it. This is an advantage of print media over digital media, which can distract us a lot with its various options and clickable advertisements.
__label__Evidence	These days, studies and work involve screen time for many. So, print media is like a break and relief. Moreover, at present more and more people are opting for Digital Detox time. Print media is super useful for them.
__label__Evidence	Following Print media can save a lot of time because all the content is compiled in a newspaper or magazine.
__label__Evidence	Still, some remote areas in India have limited access to the internet. Print media is a blessing for them to know the latest happenings around the world.
__label__Position	Cryptocurrencies should be legalized
__label__Evidence	Immigrants from non-European countries are also growing old.
__label__Evidence	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments.
__label__Evidence	Integrating an immigrant into the EU is costly.

__label__Evidence	Integrating an immigrant into the EU is costly.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all! Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world. Radioactive rain - cool ;-)
__label__Position	We should subsidize hydrogen vehicles
__label__Position	We need a stand-alone European army.
__label__Evidence	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.
__label__Evidence	Members should adopt measures to end unpaid Internships causes they are a form of exploitation of young people.
__label__Evidence	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.
__label__Evidence	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.
__label__Position	We should prohibit certain energy-intensive cryptocurrencies
__label__Position	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy
__label__Evidence	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. It is only transitional. We have good conditions for sustainable green energy (solar, wind, hydro, bio-methane and their combinations).
__label__Position	Beauty pageants should be banned
__label__Evidence	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries.
__label__Evidence	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely.
__label__Evidence	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries.

__label__Position	We should include young people in decision-making processes considering climate change
__label__Position	The President of the European Commission should be directly elected by direct universal suffrage
__label__Position	Surrogacy should be banned
__label__Position	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes
__label__Position	We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms
__label__Position	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants
__label__Position	Electric cars are not a solution to air pollution
__label__Position	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.
__label__Position	We need a plan for receiving asylum/migrants.
__label__Evidence	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it. We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control. I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic.
__label__Evidence	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.
__label__Evidence	With the ongoing population explosion, in particular in Africa and the ME, the EU has no other option than a total ban on immigration. Exceptions can be made for temporary stays and for experts the EU needs.
__label__Evidence	The EU attempts to gain power over the EU members on the distribution of immigrants. It thereby cuts the rights of the EU members.
__label__Evidence	The EU is also weak in dealing with NGOs and in dealing with countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrants. Indeed, the EU cannot be trusted because of a lack of ambition or lack of competence.
__label__Evidence	The NGOs are committing the EXACT same crime Lukashenko is guilty of: Organizing mass migration and directing it toward Europe is aggression and an act of hybrid warfare.
__label__Position	US-Mexico border wall is a good thing
__label__Evidence	It's an empty slogan that doesn't reflect the core principles and true nature of European integration. Member States and their peoples are the basis.
__label__Evidence	The random radical constitutional foundation of the EU only riles hesitant populaces without solving a particular problem.
__label__Evidence	Less centralization in Brussels, more flexibility.
__label__Evidence	This is the only way that European values and democracies can survive the challenges ahead of us. Europe has two kinds of countries: small countries and small countries that haven't realised they are small yet. If we want to protect European sovereignty we need to keep integrating. The other option is to sell our countries to China and Russia or turn them into American colonies.
__label__Evidence	No Federations, no centralization. We need to respect the European diversity.
__label__Evidence	A federal republic in which all European peoples can live according to their own way of life and identity. Yes, that would help!
__label__Evidence	We must recognize that in the face of climate change, a refugee crisis, a past financial crisis, and now a pandemic, it is no longer sufficiently well-welcomed to present the interests of Europeans
__label__Evidence	The individual member states are too weak to cope with the major challenges of our time.
__label__Evidence	If the EU intends to survive it has to integrate less. Go back to the EEC. Instead of building a static bloc, it should increase competitiveness.
__label__Evidence	Lately, the EU has appeared weak and non-organized. For example, we have had no joint policy on how to handle the pandemic. Actions to deal with various problems often come too late. You cannot discuss solutions for years, which requires urgent action.
__label__Evidence	Since the EU was developed, little progress and much stagnation have been made.
__label__Evidence	The EURO has been a disaster. It has impoverished the EU and turned the EU into a fighting Union.
__label__Position	Migration should not be the solution.
__label__Position	We should prohibit the sale of washing machines without suitable filters
__label__Position	Foster care brings more harm than good
__label__Evidence	Taking unilateral decisions is sometimes important because dialogue and all the other ways did not work till now.
__label__Evidence	Bifurcation can result in better governance and more efficient administration. It can also help in tackling terrorism.
__label__Evidence	This may set as a bad example for the succeeding governments. Downgrading the status of a state to union territory can be taken as a precedent. For example, If the state government is ruled by a different party from the center, and if the center wants to take control of the state, this incident can be shown as an example to do so.
__label__Evidence	This step may be used by separatists to influence youngsters in acting against the Indian government.
__label__Evidence	Moreover, tourism and film shootings faced obstacles due to the militancy in J&K. Now as Ladakh is a separate union territory, it can boost its economy.
__label__Evidence	Bifurcation of Jammu & Kashmir was done without consulting the people and local leaders of the state. Moreover, there was a blackout of communication channels and media, so they had no possibility of expressing their views. This sends a wrong message to the people and is against the democratic principles of India. It is also against the federal principles, which guarantees rights to states. Moreover, on the same day, Article 370 was revoked, so this may make local people feel like they have no say in the decisions that impact them.
__label__Evidence	Further division of Ladakh into 2 districts – Leh and Kargil on a religious basis is facing criticism from the local people. This move could have been avoided to preserve unity.
__label__Evidence	When Jammu&Kashmir were one state, Ladakh felt alienated. Its ecological and cultural uniqueness was not given enough importance and was often neglected because the culture of Ladakh and J&K are very different. Thereby people of Ladakh are demanding bifurcation for a long time. Ladakh’s local leaders feel that their region was politically neglected by the administration at J&K. So, bifurcating is a good decision.
__label__Evidence	We need to protect citizen sovereignty against bad players (be it the state, private entities, or other individuals).
__label__Evidence	Facial recognition can and will be used against each of us by governments and corporations, based on who we are and what we look like. It will create societies of fear, anxiety, and suspicion.
__label__Evidence	Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest, and not to be discriminated against.
__label__Evidence	Europe should choose a common language. This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language.
__label__Position	We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender
__label__Evidence	We have made huge strides in ending sex-based discrimination in Europe. I think we can say that - but for a few details - this issue has been resolved. 'Gender' is a political concept made out of whole cloth. One is certainly free to imagine oneself to be a pink unicorn, but in the eyes of the law and society, he or she remains a man or a woman.
__label__Position	Driverless cars should be allowed in India
__label__Evidence	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.
__label__Evidence	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.

__label__Evidence	Behavior and habits change slowly when a new direction is pointed out. People become less satisfied with changes the older they get. EU needs time for the goodwill of the people for permanent changes. Then a new EU foreign policy can be established.
__label__Evidence	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers. The EU is a necessity that is comparable with the worker's unions in the 1800 industrialization. Therefore the EU has to decide what role it wants to play in this coming world order.
__label__Evidence	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.
__label__Evidence	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.
__label__Evidence	If an employee receives part of his salary in the form of car and petrol, he will naturally use it more than he would otherwise, be less inclined to explore alternative ways of transport and opt for a bigger more polluting vehicle than what he really needs.
__label__Evidence	How would you know how many cases where companies and employees rely on their cars? How would you differentiate between needs and luxury?

__label__Evidence	Women possess the same physical ability as men.
__label__Evidence	We should not prohibit women in combat since there are many physically fit women that are able to handle the physical demands of combat. It should be a choice as long as you pass the physical tests.
__label__Evidence	women should be prohibited in combat because their bodies and physical strength is not equal to that of men and so they would be at greater risk in hand to hand combat and the like.

__label__Evidence	fields of war are not places for women
__label__Evidence	elimating women from combat situations flies in the face of gender equality - it is outdated to limit the participation of somebody purely based on sex, irrespective of how dangerous it may be.
__label__Evidence	this leads to gender inequality and helps promote gender sterotypes
__label__Evidence	women are just as capable of combat as men are and not allowing them in a combat situation is sex discrimination.
__label__Evidence	in a world of equal opportunities we should allow women to enter combat if they so choose.
__label__Evidence	women should be able to fight if they are strong enough
__label__Evidence	we should prohibit women in combat because their biomechanics are different then men, therefore are not able to carry similar weight in equipment.
__label__Evidence	Men are more capable of combat than women and should be the only sex allowed in this work. They have more muscle mass, less fragility and are biologically better suited for combat.
__label__Evidence	we should not prohibit women in combat, all should be subject to the same mental and fitness tests, if you pass those you are capable of being in combat. gender is irrelevant.
__label__Evidence	woman are weaker in body strength. they also get monthly periods. they are not as physically able to fight as men are so keep them out of battle.
__label__Evidence	women in combat shouldn't be prohibited because it's an opportunity for them to reach their dreams
__label__Evidence	women are more likely to be taken captive and sexually abused.
__label__Evidence	women have proven they are equally able to cope physically , mentally and emotionally in combat
__label__Evidence	we should stop woman going into combat because their bodies wasnt built for it so will not be as strong as men, even if they are trained.
__label__Evidence	we can't have women in combat because if they have a relationship with a male in their unit it could create problems and put them and others at risk
__label__Evidence	women are equals and part of that equality is to go into combat if they wish.
__label__Evidence	Women should not be on the front lines in combat because they will take longer to recover from what they see emotionally.
__label__Evidence	women are not as strong as men so they would struggle
__label__Evidence	i think that we shouldn't prohibit women in combat because is prepared
__label__Evidence	women should be prohibited in combt as they are always going to have an extra emotional aspect for men which makes them vulnerable in combat.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't stop woman going into combat because everyone is equal and if a woman thinks she can fight then she should be allowed to do so..
__label__Evidence	Women have the exact same capabilities as men in every field of life, the military is absolutely no different.
__label__Evidence	women provide necessary support in combat areas but it is not necessary for them to fight
__label__Evidence	women physically do not have the strength, both emotionally and physically, to perform combat under pressure and women should be prohibited from combat.
__label__Evidence	if women want to stand up to fight and protect our country that desire and conviction needs to continue.
__label__Evidence	women lack the stamina to be in combat roles
__label__Evidence	we should not prohibit women in combat because women can be perform just as well as men can.
__label__Evidence	women are naturally weaker than men, and are at a major disadvantage in combat.
__label__Evidence	women are weaker than men and thus would be more of a burden than a help in the battlefield.
__label__Evidence	women are more level-headed than men and would be an asset in a combat role
__label__Evidence	women are just as capable as men and should be able to do any job they choose
__label__Evidence	allowing women in combat gives us the numbers we need to be ready with trained soldiers for anything that might come up
__label__Evidence	we should prohibit women in combat because it would be distracting for the men who would feel the need to protect them during battles.
__label__Evidence	women are physically weaker than men so it does not make sense to allow women in combat.
__label__Evidence	women should be prohibited from combat roles as their absence is detrimental to their children
__label__Evidence	women don't belong on the battlefield because there are so many things that can go wrong if they get too emotional
__label__Evidence	there are many combat roles that woman can handle as well as if not better than men due to their unique viewpoint.
__label__Evidence	women are physically and emotionally exceptional performers in high pressure situations and should not be prohibited from combat.
__label__Evidence	a woman fighting in nature is a last resort, a do or die moment, so a woman in combat is formidable and should be valued and to prohibit women in combat would be to deny a wonderful resource.
__label__Evidence	Women are not physically able to perform the same roles as men in the military and are too emotional for combat
__label__Evidence	women are as capable as men to enter in armed combat
__label__Evidence	We do not want women to be in the front line of danger.
__label__Evidence	"women are mentally and physically just as ""tough"" during combat and they have a definite place in combat and should not be prohibited from combat"
__label__Evidence	Equal rights for women makes it obvious that they also have the equal right to be part of our combat forces.

__label__Evidence	all citizens should be given equal opportunity. if a woman wants to support her country on the battlefield, she should be able to do so.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't prohibit women in combat because it can help advance their careers
__label__Evidence	who but a misogynist would doubt their capacity for courage, aggressiveness or grace under fire at this point
__label__Evidence	women have shown to be equal to men in many areas; armed combat could be another one of those areas.
__label__Evidence	prohibiting women in combat is sexist. women are just as capable of men in combat with proper training.
__label__Evidence	women shouldn't be stopped from fighting based purely on their gender; instead tests should be carried out on everyone wanting to fight to ensure they meet the minimum standards.
__label__Evidence	women can do anything men can and it is an archaic thought to believe they should be kept away from war situations.
__label__Evidence	women in the military should be created equally as they receive the same rate of pay.

__label__Evidence	we should not prohibit women in combat because they have every much right to fight for their country as men.
__label__Evidence	we should stop woman going into combat because they are not as physically strong as men and are more likely to fail or get killed.
__label__Evidence	women play a crucial role in combat.
__label__Evidence	as a whole, women are more emotional and may not be able to handle combat emotionally
__label__Evidence	women have the knowledge and abilities to be able to contribute in any combat situation.
__label__Evidence	There is scientific consensus on the fact that fish have the ability to feel pain and emotions such as fear.
__label__Evidence	Fishing with live bait creates the risk of introducing and spreading invasive species, as well as the risk of transmitting diseases to wild fish.
__label__Evidence	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense.
__label__Evidence	By focusing on the well-being of people, particularly disenfranchised people, the EU can arrive at a more complete and sustainable vision of global peace and prosperity.
__label__Position	We should ban human cloning
__label__Position	We need a Europe that respects life from conception is a humane Europe
__label__Position	We need a single immigration policy.
__label__Evidence	Not taking climate impact and biodiversity loss into account makes it difficult for businesses to move towards a more virtuous system.
__label__Evidence	It is important to take into account all negative consequences in the balance sheet of companies so that everything that is taken/destroyed/polluted from nature is accounted for.
__label__Position	We should invest in R&D
__label__Evidence	Eurocrats must learn to act within the space afforded them by the European Treaties. Their grandstanding and theatrics are counterproductive
__label__Evidence	To begin with, stop using the labels “Europe” and “European” to name the EU institutions and initiatives. Do not forget that there are parts of the EU that are not part of Europe (the Spanish territories of the Canary Islands and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, for example, belong to Africa from a geographical point of view); also, that there are parts of Europe that do not belong to Europe (the UK and Switzerland, to name only two); the EU and Europe are not synonyms: Cyprus is a member state of the EU, but 'if' geographically it is Europe, so must be Turkey.
__label__Position	We should not subsidize large agricultural groups
__label__Evidence	I agree with Ian. It has real life consequences. It is important that moderators can identify hate speech, that is not free speech.
__label__Position	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__Evidence	But why give space for extremist conservatism?  
__label__Evidence	Absolutely, hate speech forms thoughts, which forms character which leads to violent actions with enough time. It's a very serious issue that causes real world harm to marginalized communities when left unchecked.
__label__Position	"""Retrofitting may use published appearances so then no need to seek permissions to adapt homes"" (Cristopher Jofeh)"
__label__Position	These include the mostly the state of the NHS and funding, as well as policing and education. 
__label__Position	I also think detecting & moderating potentially hateful comments both through algorithms and manual reporting is the best way to go about it. Comments should be held back for review if there's any reports or detection of potential hate speech. When reporting, people should have the space to briefly explain their reason for reporting though because a lot of times, hate comments can be nuanced or reference things that will often go above the heads of those reviewing the reports if they only have a very basic list of types of report they can choose from.
__label__Evidence	Disagree because the rate at which suicides are happening due to
__label__Evidence	totally in favour, even if some moderation rule should be in place to limit trolls!!
__label__Position	An independant moderator
__label__Evidence	it is not always possible to monitor every single post
__label__Position	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.
__label__Position	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__Position	the should be strong monitoring and assessments before news is published .
__label__Evidence	https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2377-social-media-hiring.html
__label__Position	read the comments and give your best opinion
__label__Evidence	What point is there in preserving our climate for humanity, if, by taking these sorts of actions, we lose our collective humanity? Better for the human race to go extinct than to degrade to barbaric form of behavior advocated for in this argument.
__label__Position	The readers have the right of speech but as newspaper they can filter out words which protect the credibility of the paper
__label__Evidence	They might sift a bit
__label__Evidence	I think it is useful to read others opinions & points of view on various topics. It would deny people possible education to take this away.
__label__Position	I am very disappointed that Brexit has been so ignored by all the parties
__label__Position	It makes sense to use AI to monitor certain words that are going to cause offence.
__label__Position	Trident, brexit, cost of living, EU
__label__Position	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__Evidence	most topics have at least 2 opinions
__label__Evidence	a team of moderators won't be a viable option because, because people can't posts comments in real time
__label__Evidence	We are a minority where we live, everyone is Eastern European, and most have come illegally and don't work, causing a bigger strain on services 
__label__Evidence	at least he has integrity
__label__Position	It can be done by using algorithms
__label__Evidence	What about it? more money for education? change the curriculum?  
__label__Evidence	Who and what would be classed as a less strict criteria?
__label__Evidence	We wont get honest feedback from the views
__label__Evidence	Send a but overjoyed, I think the issues that people complain about immigration like low pay no jobs could be solved in productive ways without demonizing immigrants
__label__Evidence	In an ideal world allowing all forms of free speech would be good but unfortunately it would likely result in racial and religious hatred and violent content.
__label__Position	Comments need to be monitored.
__label__Evidence	This is a great idea as people can openly speak their opinions without worry of being attacked.
__label__Evidence	But that is not the question.
__label__Evidence	How is this going to stop trolls that create multiple accounts so that if they are blocked they just do it from another faceless account consequences.l
__label__Position	The economy, foreign policy
__label__Position	"It is an open question: ""H ow we can control and direct public money efficiently toward the heritage and climate challenge?"" (Steven Bee, Consultant and former chair of The Academy of Urbanism) "
__label__Evidence	Simultaneously limits freedom of opinion. A censored comment section can hinder thought-provoking discussions
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__Evidence	"There are many scientist who refute the ""climate change scenario but are silenced and not allowed to speak their beliefs. They are classified as ""conspiracy theorists"""
__label__Evidence	I like the idea of 'repeat offenders' being noticed if you will. It means people can't abuse the system as easily
__label__Evidence	Changing conceptual frameworks doesn t address immediate economic challenges for farmers
__label__Evidence	Should be built and handed over to Councils to replace stock sold via Right to Buy.
__label__Evidence	why was the comment removed
__label__Position	i agree that hate spech blocking does not really help in many ways. the root cause is the behavioral problem that needs a changed. i completely agree not to have comments section in many forums
__label__Position	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)
__label__Position	We need to create more shared spaces for dialogue between different stakeholders
__label__Evidence	True people should be able to express their opinions
__label__Position	i want to vote for a party that will improve our nhs
__label__Position	"The only way I can see this being done fairly is hiring a software development team/company to develop an algorithm or ""Bot"" that can be updated with keywords, phrases and common dog whistles used by racists, homophobes, misygonists etc. You would also need a dedicated moderation team that are able to catch anything that slips through the cracks and who are able to understand nuance that a bot could not"
__label__Position	There is a strong regulatory element needed to crack down on platforms by newpapers for encouraging this.  The Code of Practise (https://www.ipso.co.uk/editors-code-of-practice/) for Editors should include expectations that comments can be made freely but will be managed an hate crimes reported.
__label__Evidence	agree as it can sometimes be very harmful
__label__Evidence	The comment section should not be taken out instead, they should use software that is able to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted
__label__Evidence	what do you mean?
__label__Evidence	i'm not sure this would allow the nuance that only a human could see though?
__label__Evidence	Yes this is a very important consideration in that we dont operate in a homogenous society. and culturally we are not the same, so what I consider harsh hate speech might just be considered banter to another group of society.
__label__Position	With the increase of humans on our planet, we need to understand resources are finite and adapt.
__label__Evidence	What is it about taxes you disagree with?
__label__Evidence	Restricts free speech
__label__Position	More effort is needed to raise the awareness in humans.If else the climate change cause the humans lives matter.Future decades will damaged by climate change.
__label__Evidence	Yes, I think there are major issues needing sorting first although I agree this need to be addressed. 
__label__Position	maybe if certain words are used, they are recognized and the post cant be posted.
__label__Position	any hateful content should be removed and all other comments left
__label__Position	I think that is a good idea but the amount of manpower needed to monitor millions of comments is just unfeasible and there is no ai or algorithm that exist that can detect with accuracy what is hate speech and what is being playful
__label__Position	By having algorithms to block certain phrases or words and constant flagging of concerning content. There would need to be moderators to check comments and remove them as necessary
__label__Position	I don't think that readers' comments are necessary on a newspaper site. There are a plethora of other platforms on which people can engage in discussion and share opinions. I don't believe that removing the comments will have an overall impact on hate speech however. If people choose to behave in that manner, they will find a place to do it regardless.
__label__Evidence	I think it's terrible for young people with families who have to pay rent or mortgages as well as feed and care for their children.
__label__Evidence	I think that is a very good idea
__label__Evidence	Completely agree with what everyone has said about immigration needing to be reigned in 
__label__Position	I think developing a system that will flag certain words, the post then should be automatically prohibited, this will help in filtering the comments.
__label__Evidence	No hate speech will be written
__label__Evidence	if we the individuals dont try then who are we to tell the chinese 
__label__Evidence	Although people might abuse the flagging, however, if there are reviewers to do their work on those flags, these comments that have been flagged intentionally would not be removed.
__label__Evidence	"""Sometimes structures not ready for modern use, e.g. corridors too narrow, stairs not secure etc."" (Anna Beckett)"
__label__Position	Have comments checked before posting
__label__Evidence	I think everyone has a right to freedom of speech, no one should be censored
__label__Evidence	I don't believe this really. There are scientists who definitely dispute that humans are a cause of climate change. They also cite many types of weather patterns that cycle over and over over thousands of years that are also part of the cause.
__label__Position	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__Evidence	Yes definitely agree, but unfortunately even with help for a good deposit the house prices are so high that unless you earn a lot, nobody will lend you the remainder you need to borrow
__label__Evidence	good way to make a point
__label__Position	We need an action programme to develop a more inclusive sector 
__label__Position	The climate change is the major important issue in current situation because the emission of CO2 content is more in the air so it will affect the ozone layer and this will become the major issue for the earth so we need to take care of our earth by controlling the climate change. We need to protect our earth for our future generation so we need to take a step based on the climate change.
__label__Position	Give users the ability to flag or hide posts from users they deem to be participating in hate speech. If one account is consistently flagged or hidden, a manual review should take place to decide if the user should be permanently banned from posting.
__label__Position	housing, education, cost of living
__label__Evidence	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.
__label__Evidence	What about peoples right to freely express themselves on platforms
__label__Position	Although my default position is against censorship of free speech, I have to agree with certain commentators here that the comments expressed at the end of articles rarely have anything enlightening to add to the article, mostly it's just a way for the man in the street to vent and feel their view is being heard. I'm sure most of us can empathise with the feeling of helpless and invisibility a lot of commentators express.
__label__Evidence	roads are in a shocking state especially in the rural areas 
__label__Evidence	There are equal rights, just some who don't want to work as hard as others 
__label__Position	I don’t usually write something but I like reading comments. So I don’t want them to be taken away. There should be a combination of factors: moderators and a possibility for the users to vote a comment (like and dislike). Abusive comments should also be reported by the users, making the moderators job easier.
__label__Position	adjuster
__label__Position	my general thought is to consider the issues that are most important to me which i have mentioned and to vote the party that i beelieve will best represent that interest 
__label__Position	As a student, the cost of living is the main issue for me. Inflation and the state of the economy inevitably then tie in with that.
__label__Evidence	This would be very helpful
__label__Position	There are two groups of people. one who want to save the ecology and another group who want to exploit the environment for making money. unless strict rules are passed to stop the abuse of nature we cant save the nature and the environment
__label__Evidence	The drawback here is that people get carried away and be verbally aggressive and use foul language which doesn't go well with most of the readers who come to view the news and some of the healthy discussions in the comment section. But, all they find it few people engaging in a verbal war which is uncalled for.
__label__Evidence	maybe get something to control what comes in and goes out
__label__Evidence	tax the rich and tighten up on the old laws which allows them to pay less tax
__label__Evidence	This is probably the optimal solution, but it  also requires a lot of work force and might be quite expensive, too.
__label__Position	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__Position	I think the solution lies in the use of moderators, preferably with those who've undertaken training, alongside AI technology to ensure that thoughts/debates in the comment remain hate-free. I am on the fence as to whether real-life details should also be added, due to concerns for some vulnerable users' security. However, this is an option that newspaper websites could also investigate.
__label__Position	Lack of integrity 
__label__Position	I think allowing people to comment should continue, and be moderated
__label__Position	it ain't go work hate will always be there we build this society to be like this
__label__Position	the NHS, Education and housing
__label__Position	I feel that manmade climate change can be reversed by everyone working together and making sacrifices to improve the environment. It will be made possible by people figuring out ways to save on carbon emissions instead of taking the easiest route. If we can do that in more ways than one, we should be able to save the planet.
__label__Evidence	Do you mean the shadow cabinet minsters as well? As they seem not to serve any purpose.
__label__Position	delete hater comments and monitor them and ban them.
__label__Position	We are on a slippery slope. Soon we won't have any privacy online whatsoever.  We won't be able to express ourselves properly and won't be able to be anonymous.  Is it really worth losing our privacy and our right to free speech just to avoid potentially offending some people?  This issue has been being studied and written about for years now.  Take a look at this Pew Research Center article from 2017: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Evidence	Free speech is a responsibility to one selves and to the society we live in .Does that mean total anarchy?
__label__Evidence	Absolutely agree with you;removing the comments section will achieve nothing  as it will drown out even sound contributions to the discussion(s).
__label__Position	I believe that freedom of speech is important but freedom of speech should not be taken for granted and where a person would seek to take it away from others, then they may lose it themselves.  From this position, I would not agree with removing the comment section on online newspapers because this is a lazy way of dealing with the issue.  I would rather see moderation of hate speech.  I think removing comment sections changes nobody's mind and stifles debate.  It would not reduce polarisation to remove comment sections.  I have often seen people dealing effectively with trolls and hate speakers themselves anyway apart from moderators.  Hiding a problem does not stop the problem.  It fuels polarisation to make division invisible.  It also means that media can slant a particular article in a chosen direction and this cannot be challenged, even by those affected, without being able to comment.  So in this respect, having no comment section can increase injustice, not reduce it.  Ultimately, a person can and should be banned from commenting if they are consistently abusive towards others.
__label__Evidence	I agree something needs to be done but I'd rather our Government focused on sorting our issues out as a priority.   
__label__Position	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Position	The Conservatives are an absolute shambles and have been for years. My main issue for is with animal abuse in that they allow fox hunting which is actually illegal
__label__Evidence	I agree with that. We shouldn't incentive hate speech.
__label__Evidence	There is clear evidence of the efficacy of different moderation practices because these have been used on various sites for years now.
__label__Evidence	The newspaper has the duty of educating and informing the public. One-sided articles should not be allowed as they fail to give a full perspective and may even spread misinformation, if there commenters are not allowed to correct or add a new perspective.
__label__Position	stop the privatisation of childrens care and bring it back into the control of LAs. Our vunerable children should not be used for profit
__label__Evidence	the link provides usefull ways for people to deal with hate speech
__label__Position	it should be regulated by setting standards
__label__Evidence	yes but who do we have to run the country competently? 
__label__Evidence	Agree, it was meant to be a help for working people which was the purpose of it when Ian Duncan Smith was one of those that designed it.  Then as usual the rest of the Tories obliterated it and made it what it is today, causing more damage to people than good!
__label__Evidence	We should avoid appearing like we are doing cancel culture
__label__Position	Hate speech is a problem in a world that is becoming more and more polarised; our basic human rights and freedoms are in jeopardy if we can be subjected to violence just because of our race, gender, sexual orientation... It's important to work on the root of the problem and provide quality education from an early age so that children become more used to diversity. Eliminating space for readers comments won't prevent hate speech from existing, so it's just a patch to a bigger problem.
__label__Position	The easy way for a bot or system to analyze what could be a hate speech could be to select certain words that are usually associated to descrimination. This could be developed by studying existing comments and seeing what are the most repeated dialogues.
__label__Evidence	I feel it will certainly lead to a more equitable playing field for all 
__label__Evidence	The one time I wrote to my MP to ask for help they didn't even acknowledge my email. No way are they getting my vote. They don't care about their consituents!
__label__Evidence	How would you like to see it reformed? 
__label__Evidence	This would be removing freedom of speech. I think that is a very problematic road to go down.
__label__Position	The only way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites is letting the readers know that if they comment with negative words on the comment section they will be blocked
__label__Evidence	"""Legislation is a blunt and slow instrument. Rather go for REGULATION"" (Christopher Jofeh)"
__label__Position	We could indicate that hate speech is prohibited and that a fine will be given and possible imorisonment
__label__Evidence	they wont be taking a lead unless they allie themselves so only relevant where they are surely
__label__Evidence	i dont agree, it is too controlling , there needs to be a middle ground of moderating
__label__Evidence	Agreed, HMPS are failing due to the lack of adequate resources and funding. 
__label__Evidence	True and in my opinion the right to freedom of speech should trump any counter argument.
__label__Position	"""AHF is a charity which promotes the conservation and sustainable re-use of historic buildings for the benefit of communities across the UK, particularly in economically disadvantaged areas."" AHF case-studies offera wide range of ideas of what has already been done and can inspire new projects on heritage and historic building conservation and requalification https://ahfund.org.uk/news/case-studies/"" (Esther Robinson Wild)"
__label__Evidence	agree with this - it's a conflict of interest 
__label__Position	Even if we all do not agree with each other (it would be a boring place if we did!) I don't think it is right to completely removing commenting on newspaper websites and articles. But there are people out there who will use those areas as an excuse and a place to spout their horrible opinions and hate speech. When they do this then detracts from the original article as people will start to call the person out so it becomes all about them. There may also be people reading those views who could be influenced by them which is why they need to be removed as quickly as possible.
__label__Evidence	CO2 reaches historic levels everyday.When it is control the climate change returned normal condition.Unless future will be in worst condition.
__label__Position	By disabling harmful and hateful words from what someone can comment. If we are able to black specific words and phrases that. could be considered hateful or derogatory, hate speech would be a lot less in comments and it wouldn't prevent readers from still commenting.
__label__Evidence	Agreed, there's needs to be stronger consequences for those sharing hate speech. Those behind accounts which troll and leave horrific content should be banned and the ip address blocked.
__label__Evidence	The flipside of being too visionary is needing to balance this with practical, realistic objectives and trusting your people to give open and constructive challenge to wacky ideas.
__label__Evidence	yep ! annoyingly the older generation will probably support though
__label__Position	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__Position	This is a complicated topic with no easy answers. I think it is reasonable for each website to have their own company policy that discourages hate speech on their platform. This could be achieved via human or algorithmic checking, the blanket ban of certain words and phrases, or some form of community accountability that downvotes or reports certain comments.
__label__Position	No, everyone has freedom of speech, citizen opinions should be heard just as journalists are. 
__label__Evidence	who will be our doctors and lawyers and accountants and teachers. british citizens are so lazy and entitled. they whine about people taking jobs from them but cant get off their bottoms to actually do anything productive 
__label__Position	Eliminating the comments section will reduce engagement and the sense of having a dialogue / encouraging free speech in the publication, which would be detrimental to the newspaper. Having comment moderation, in moderation (no pun intended!) would probably be the best way forward. https://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/online-comment-moderation-emerging-best-practices
__label__Position	I was reading through an article called Thou Shalt Not Hate: Countering Online Hate Speech and it summarized my view quiet fairly on the topic. https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3237/3105
__label__Evidence	I feel like we somehow need to be a little bit more specific on which tools could work, because many times it could also be difficult to set limits in what can be said and what not. I would say that we could use a sort of algorithm which can recognize offensive comments and delete them.
__label__Evidence	Hiding them could be a good idea as it allows a log of this person, and could even allow possible banning of people from the platform if they use it in a bad way
__label__Evidence	Until we sort out peoples finances we do not have a stable base in which to progress.
__label__Evidence	Less Issues with arguments and trolls
__label__Evidence	Please vote! Even if you go against the grain
__label__Evidence	This would allow discussion while at the same time ensuring a system is in place to reduce harm/offense.
__label__Position	Better benefits systems - Money to people who are genuinely in need not people who are just too lazty to work and do things. 
__label__Position	human rights
__label__Evidence	There is a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech. One is neccesary, intellectual and somewhat constructive without being rude. The other is a global problem causing suicide attempts and mental health issues.
__label__Position	I think another option for reducing hate speech from newspapers would be to remove the anonymity from comment sections and make everyone have to post under their own name. I think anonymity gives peols the protection to say things that they owuln not necessarily be able to say if everyone knew who they were a chance that they could be held accountable for their hat speech.
__label__Position	Only allow people to chose their comments from a pre-set acceptable range of options. These could range from being pro or against an issue but prevent hateful language from appearing.
__label__Evidence	Theyre all so similar in the end... no one really stands up for the people 
__label__Position	Using an algorithm is the best solution.
__label__Evidence	just a maybe if kids are taught to be nice online or in comments from a tender age.
__label__Position	The Hunting ban which the Conservatives have never enforced is the main issue for me
__label__Evidence	Banning hate speech will radicalize people who will only feel more oppressed by the opposition trying to silence them.
__label__Evidence	Not allowing them to be anynymous might probably discourage some good-intentioned people to comment as well.
__label__Position	Education is important but may not be helpful to those who refuse to learn, but if someone is at that point, removing comments is likely going to make them more angry, some people may just need their comments individually removed.
__label__Evidence	Simply providing facts doesn t work because people filter information through identity-based biases
__label__Position	End impunity for hate crimes: Newsroom monitoring and evaluation teams can help combat impunity for hate crimes. The goal of these groups would then be to track patterns in hate speech, compile reports, and alert important institutions and the civil society to them.
__label__Position	Policing the comments section by the newspaper does run the risk silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech, but law-abiding and Nobel citizens wont shy away from engaging in the topics, its only those ill-mouthed readers who will run that risk.policing the comments sections should be mandatory because if its not in place, they run the risk of losing readers due to them feeling unsafe and not protected
__label__Position	There's lots of evidence of the impact of hate speech and the damage it can cause to individual's mental health https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech.  https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2022.0009?journalCode=cyber
__label__Position	I agree with AliceW. Fake news sells and attracts more people to read. However, voicing an opinion does not need to include hate speech.
__label__Evidence	what does that even mean??
__label__Position	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation
__label__Position	We need people to supply their personal details in order to limit hate speech
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is not at all the same as valid criticism.  And if freedon of speech is resulting in hate speech then I think it should indeed be policed and silenced
__label__Evidence	agreed. no one body/company should be given that much power. dialogue and transparency is the cornerstone of any democracy
__label__Evidence	Hunting people down for their opinions is too much like big brother/censorship!
__label__Position	We need to hire moderators to check through forums and censor what needs to be censored. People should not be allowed to make hateful or negative comments.
__label__Evidence	lack of freedom of speech
__label__Position	Learning and unlearning hateful speech has to come from education, being used an early intervention method would likely support a reduction in hate speech overall and therefore in newspapers
__label__Position	Today the growing population is struggling to live with the available resources as it is not sufficient to meet the demands of the people , so they have to interfere with the nature and exploiting it . You can say they are using more and more chemical in agriculture to grow more and fast which is not at all good for the human ultimately and to the nature.
__label__Evidence	so
__label__Evidence	Who is to say what is or isn't 'harmful'? It sounds like you want to control a good chunk of the population who don't agree with you on things.
__label__Evidence	Algorithms are not always accurate
__label__Evidence	Exactly the newspapers must be the place to comment because they give us the article but this article is written by a journalist. Therefore, the article represent the ideas of the journalist. Not all the time they are neutral. Sometimes they are even politically influenced. This often provokes discussions and where else can people say their opinion if there is no comment section?
__label__Evidence	I agree with you. I am a member of some public facebook groups for various things and they all have volunteer moderators who immediately remove harmful content. This is definitely feasible, especially if they are paid positions.
__label__Position	The economy, NHS, welfare system, education system, crime 
__label__Position	Start reforms at local government level first
__label__Position	Comments posted by readers must be filtered
__label__Position	Maybe AI could filter hate speech
__label__Evidence	Readers comments are an accountability tool for curation
__label__Position	yes I go with the statement saying If governments around the world treat climate change collectively - the same way they treated World War 2 for instance - then is possible, no matter the cost
__label__Position	no, after all news paper should represent freedom of speech 
__label__Evidence	I absolutely agree. The first sentence sums it perfectly!
__label__Position	Alongside moderators and verification of profiles, I think offensive language should be immediately recognised by the system and disallow users from posting and/or move their comment to a 'moderator' section to double check the context first.
__label__Position	enhancement through education on media laws and ethics
__label__Evidence	True, we need to increase technology to deal with this problem.
__label__Position	treatment of asylum seekers
__label__Evidence	how can we get all countries on board with this?
__label__Position	Invest to reduce homelessness
__label__Position	many issues , including taxation, NHS, immigration, housing, security, pensioners, 
__label__Position	Bring in more financial regulation of hedge funds, tax avoidence etc
__label__Evidence	and the shrinkflation - product sizes becoming smaller and prices still going up! 
__label__Evidence	Well said and well put argument here
__label__Position	I think there could newspapers should have a policy where they have the right to delete  any comment that is hate speech.
__label__Evidence	c onsidering that information, and the hate speech which is still on Facebook - is AI able to work effectively?
__label__Evidence	Inflation is largely a global problem. Prices can't go back to what they were - that is deflation which is very bad for the economy.  
__label__Evidence	I think inflation is in a much better place now, but yes the cost of living when it comes to things like groceries and housing are way too high
__label__Position	Help with NHS, help for low earners
__label__Position	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__Position	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__Position	We should work to stop polluting the planet just for this sake alone. Who doesn't want a cleaner planet?
__label__Position	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__Position	Comment spaces enhances social participation
__label__Evidence	The mention of collaborative efforts underscores the importance of multi-stakeholder involvement, which is crucial for effective solutions.
__label__Evidence	I agree. Especially people who work in that area of expertise and can give valuable inputs
__label__Evidence	I don't agree as I don't think it's that easy to mix up hate speech and an opinion, if you genuinley don't have any hateful intentions. For example, not liking an establishments choices is much different from major hate/offensive speech
__label__Evidence	That's true. Most social media companies are already using AI to detect and remove hate speech. Here's an article about this: https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/
__label__Evidence	"""We should encourage people to engage and enjoy living in these buildings"" (Esther Robinson Wild)"
__label__Position	Taxes, economy, Brexit
__label__Position	Is anyone able to respond to anyone else at this point?
__label__Position	Can't vote Labour, as they will take this country further into the economic and social abyss.
__label__Evidence	This is interesting! I read an article about moderators with different policies on what constitutes hate speech and should be removed. There is an argument that some are too strict and moderate incivility, rather than just hate speech. Perhaps an AI version would have clearer guidelines programmed in? https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Evidence	agreed.AI woudl be more objective and impartial thtn human moderators
__label__Position	None of leaders fill me with confidence, none of them feel like strong leaders who could 'grab the bull by it horns'
__label__Evidence	most comment sections usually generate comments that turn into arguements if unmoderated
__label__Evidence	However some people might argue that what they said is not hate speech, and that the newspaper is trying to censor their opinion
__label__Evidence	the servers could store our info
__label__Position	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech According to the UN, it can be difficult to moderate hate speech due to not wanting to violate people’s right to free speech. The article linked here appears to favour educating and responding to the comment writers rather than eliminating their comments entirely.
__label__Position	I'm not privy to your situation and as you say, you earn above average so what has gone wrong must surely be within your control to get back on track
__label__Position	Like others have said I think the best way to deal with hate speech in the comments section is by putting in place a moderation system. When the commenter hits send on his post a moderator or bot check the contents of the message and decide whether it should be published or not.
__label__Evidence	Those of us in formal leadership positions need to amplify diversity through enabling informal leadership whilst challenging the status quo
__label__Position	Candidate integrity 
__label__Evidence	why? I am on a zero hour contract and I love it, I only work when I want to 
__label__Evidence	It would stop hate speech the easiest way.
__label__Position	You can if you teach yourself to refrain from being a mean person.
__label__Position	In my opinion, we need a large number of moderators in the comment sections who can quickly delete or censor hateful comments. But for all that it is necessary that these sections are not subjected to a too big censorship so that people can continue to express themselves freely
__label__Position	“Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.” — United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, May 2019                  https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	I agree that moderators can be useful, but they will probably be young people who are seemingly offended by everything and yet claim to be tolerant.
__label__Evidence	Sadly although this IS a genuine massive problem, people need to eat and work and prosper in even some SMALL ways before they can get their heads around a larger problem.  This has resulted in Climate and nature going down the list of importance for many at the moment.
__label__Position	Totally agree with this. Not everyone uses the comments section for negative reasons, and I think comments help people generate and share ideas that can be helpful too.
__label__Evidence	All we can do is reduce our impact but not reverse it.Unfortunately is statistically inevitable 
__label__Evidence	I agree. I think that nothing is being done to help renters and this is one solution that can help. 
__label__Evidence	Removing the comments limits speech, it goes against our freedom
__label__Position	It will because a person will be forced to say something positive or nothing at all
__label__Evidence	Until more countries are committed to net zero, the little the UK can contribute is worhtless
__label__Position	A combination of human moderation and automated actions should be applied. Free speech and the ability to comment is important to maintain the relationship between media and the reader (see Society of Editors Moderation Guide - https://www.societyofeditors.org/resources/). This needs to be balanced with contributing of human resources to combat hate speech using preventative and reactive measures,
__label__Evidence	Labour has a track record of empty promises and dragging us into one crisis after another
__label__Position	Technological developments will enhance democracy and address current issues. 
__label__Evidence	This isnt a freedom of speech issue. That is only in relation to the govt not curtailing free speech. A private company... newspaper, has no obligation to allow you to freely air your views.
__label__Position	A key factor that could make filtering unfair is the fact that is done merely by automatic detection tools without human vetting or control. 
__label__Evidence	NHS needs total reform
__label__Evidence	Certain words can be detected by the program which are hate speech and removed
__label__Position	I think monitoring the comments through AI or a human would solve the issue while allowing free speech
__label__Position	England has one of the oldest building stocks in Europe with 21% of dwellings built before 1919 (c. 5.1 million buildings) and 16% built between 1919 and 1945. The majority of these building will still be in use come 2050 and throughout the lifetime of our carbon zero plans. Decision-makers must understand the scale of the task, but more importantly must realise that expertise around traditional construction should be given a louder voice when it comes to governance, policy making and future planning.  
__label__Position	I think also having a different social media outside the website to give opportunity for people to have an open discussion regarding whatever was written. In this way if someone commit hate speech on a social media site than it will be easier to remove them from the discussion.
__label__Position	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.
__label__Position	In summary, I think comment sections in newspapers should be preserved but with some form of moderation -- both automatic through software and human-driven. I recognize that there is a need to protect free speech, but hate speech goes beyond the type of discourse that should be protected.
__label__Position	For me the issue of national service is really important, it's a very good idea to make sure young  people learn some discipline
__label__Position	Social media pages often attract trolls and hate speech. For groups that want to feel safe, moderators make these pages a much more pleasant place to be. The same could be applied to online newspapers, allowing free comment but with moderators keeping an eye to make sure no hate speech or abuse was occuring.
__label__Evidence	It is getter harder year by year by still possible.
__label__Evidence	we need to understand that freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of hatred
__label__Position	Wanting this country to move in a progressive direction
__label__Position	Views and policies on immigration and refugees. NHS. Poverty line aid 
__label__Position	Getting a grasp of controlling immigration that is degrading life for all of us
__label__Position	I am proposing the use of AI to manage this space
__label__Evidence	I think this is a bad idea. The comments section is an important means of debunking biased articles or potentially gaining a different perspective on what others think about what you've just read.
__label__Evidence	monitored comment section
__label__Position	it is very important not to be hateful to other people and their opionions,rather just not say anything.
__label__Position	if technology is improved, it would make it easier to identify and possibly eliminate hate speech ASAP. furthermore, this will allow the poers that  be to identify the people responsible for spreading hate speech and potentially allow for authorities to intervene. hate speech deeply affects and threatens us as humans, therefore it should be taken seriously.
__label__Evidence	If newspaper columnists can publish their opinions, why can't the public enjoy the same freedoms?
__label__Evidence	Yes, this is why it is so important to vote, so many people just didn't vote during brexit because they didn't think we would ever leave the EU
__label__Position	Lower taxes and interest rates
__label__Position	if we install proper home insulation the we could make a real change to some extent
__label__Position	If you are ready to harm the nature by using technology  then get ready to find a solution or alternative to nature if possible to protect the climate and environment. 
__label__Position	It's quite easy to use freedom of speech as an excuse when people comment on certain topics, so there should be some kind of restrictions on how people get to express their opinions.
__label__Evidence	I agree this article https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/ speaks about hthis also. Being anon givens comfortability and lets people hide behind a false identity, taking that away would likely reduce hate speech on popular newspaper outlets out of fear of being identified. However, those with these views would likely continue on more far-right news outlets
__label__Evidence	Starmer is no leader and there's no way I could vote for him! 
__label__Evidence	I think my last comment was the wrong way round...

__label__Position	impossible to remove hate speech if it is unmoderated
__label__Evidence	Moderator bias
__label__Evidence	Proportional Representation is likely the only way we are going to have future elections feel like they represent the majority of the country. 
__label__Evidence	Perhaps there is no humane way to stop the boats, so we should make routes to immigration easier? To avoid deaths in the channel  
__label__Evidence	I agree, as people need to be made aware that sometimes, what they say and think could offend other people.
__label__Evidence	I agree freedom of speech is important but hate speech should not be allowed
__label__Evidence	i dont think is right
__label__Evidence	People will speak what is on their mind
__label__Evidence	I think this is a really simplistic view, UK has no influence in Israel and the Middle East. 
__label__Evidence	Nice point
__label__Position	I do feel that trolls are worse as they know there is no accountability for them as they can just set up fake accounts. If ID was required to create accounts, people wouldn't be so quick to post hateful content.
__label__Position	Pensions are also important, in 2 ways, the pension is not high enough, also I believe the pension age should revert to 60/65

__label__Evidence	yes I go with the statement saying If governments around the world treat climate change collectively - the same way they treated World War 2 for instance - then is possible, no matter the cost
__label__Evidence	I agree. Nobody in government gives a toss about those less fortunate than themselves.

__label__Evidence	Newspapers are nationally available.As are there websites.Whilst newspapers cant be held responsible for the comments of its readers ,i do think they should have a moderater to delete harmfull posts that could offend.
__label__Position	By totally eliminating the comments section because most it kills reporters confidence and it may lead to hate speech and fake news
__label__Position	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__Evidence	The economy will tank under Labour
__label__Position	not really, probably some supervised moderation could help.. 
__label__Evidence	Stripping perpetrators of the right to post is very appropriate as it takes away from the individual his desire to promote his views.
__label__Evidence	In some ways I disagree, as renters have a right to earn money during the increased housing costs, but also I do agree that kicking people out when they decide to up the prices is horrific. It should be that an agreed price is arranged and the government do something to make sure that the need for increased rent is limited. 
__label__Evidence	yes i agree with you, the comment section should remain open but people have to remember to be respecyful and consider other peoples emotions
__label__Evidence	Privacy is incredibly important, I do not believe that you should have to provide personal details in order to participate in discussion.
__label__Position	Removing the Conservatives, NHS, Climate change, Cost of living crisis, low wages, schools in crisis
__label__Evidence	they need to be investigated, ewspecially for misappropriation of funds
__label__Position	Tory sleaze and corruption; the broken down nature of our public services; the fall out from Brexit
__label__Position	The housing can cost of living crisis requires some serious adjustment and needs to be addressed , along with a massive injection into our NHS services.
__label__Position	There is no one size fits all solution. With some newspapers taking an extreme viewpoint on subjects and individuals, these media outlets are actively encouraging hate speech.  No comments should be censored but individuals that type hate speech should be held to account and either prosecuted or are required to attend an educational session - think Speed Awareness courses for low level speeding offences.  And website that allows public facing comments should also have strict verification on accounts so people cannot hide behind fake or anonymous accounts.

They spoke on a point that stood out to be about having a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or dissaproving comments before they are posted to the public. although this might default on the topic of freedom of speach.
__label__Position	And remember, before you respond you’re determining whether someone is posting a hateful comment just for the sake of being a hater, and someone who wants to be heard and has helpful feedback... but could work on their delivery.
__label__Evidence	A hate speech detecting service as discussed in the following article could be the answer to this problem.https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-hate-speech-detection-a-large-scale-empirical-evaluation-92831ded6bb6
__label__Position	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__Position	Knowledge on the subject should also be accessible and should be provided thorough multiple channels to reach our key audiences. I really enjoyed listening to IHBC @COP26 podcasts (see link) https://ihbc.org.uk/podcasts/

__label__Evidence	What do you think the government can do about this, this is mostly due to the uk population, not much the government can do 
__label__Position	From reader others opinions, it feels like the ability and freedom to comment should not be taken away because of a few people that post troll or hate comments, which means the comment section should stay. But the comments that are posted have to be monitored (maybe by an AI or bot) and also be reportable by other users. I think a fair implementation would be to only allow registered site users to post comments
__label__Evidence	Removing comment speech will not allow people to express their feelings
__label__Evidence	The EU already tries to accommodate diverse opinions through consensus-building
__label__Position	I notice that there is a contrast between education and punishment towards offenders. For example, BenedictN believes that punishment is the best way to deal with hate speech. However, AllisonK and LawrenceM believe that education is the best way to deal with hate speech. I propose that all users should be educated on creating a respectful and inclusive discussion before commenting, but if hate speech is detected, punitive measures should include further educational measures that encourage discussing respectfully instead of avoiding discussion.
__label__Evidence	Bigger than that; 1/3 of existing dwellings are of traditional (solid wall/naroow cavity) construction, and 75% of building work is to existing dwellings. This is not a niche. In this we differ substantially from most EU countries. BUT comfort doesn't necessarily equate to higher temperature, it's more about relative humidity and temperature differentials between people and surfaces.
__label__Position	Newspaper articles can be very biased based on the views and opinions of the reporter, so a comment section is essential for allowing people to share alternative views and point out biases. Other methods should be found to reduce hate speech in comments, such as moderation or reporting of comments.
__label__Position	This should be a priority, some hate speech is not necessary
__label__Evidence	We definitely need more affordable housing, for the general population to buy, not landlords! And affordable social housing
__label__Evidence	There are more than 2 parties.. 
__label__Evidence	Yes, During this lockdown days, the earth seems to be very good. But one day is not enough.
__label__Position	The easy way for a bot or system to analyze what could be a hate speech could be to select certain words that are usually associated to descrimination. This could be developed by studying existing comments and seeing what are the most repeated dialogues. 
__label__Position	I believe that completely removing comments does remove a reader's write to share their opinions and thoughts but i also believe that there is an appropriate way to share opinions across. Hate speech does not allow for healthy and constructive conversations.
__label__Position	By closer monitoring of comments
__label__Position	Again, a committee should be set to properly scrutinize the comments before they are uploaded.
__label__Evidence	I disagree with this to an extent, in order to have an open debate, both sides would have to be coming at the issue from a similarly open minded position, which realistically is not going to happen.
__label__Evidence	While I agree that it is getting harder every year, we need to do something about it now. It's never going to be an easy process, but the sooner we start, the better. We need to make drastic changes now so that policy and consumer interaction can be at the level necessary to move things in the correct direction. 
__label__Evidence	I don't think algorithm can accurately detect hate speech.
__label__Position	Here are reasons why I agree with the position of having comments being moderated,it benefits everyone and prevents harmful or hateful speech.
__label__Position	The basic honesty of the candidates and their integrity in actually giving direct answers to questions
__label__Evidence	Heavy moderation by the newspapers could prevent people being able to post their opinions
__label__Position	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__Position	Education (though it's devolved in Scotland, pensions and many more pensioners being dragged into paying taxes, and housing.
__label__Position	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__Evidence	I don't think there are any
__label__Position	By having a designated team to check all comments before they are made public: if comments contain hate speech, they should not make it onto the the final comment section.
__label__Position	There should be a system of other contributors being able to flag potential hare speech and a way to vote on whether the comment was hate speech, enabling a balanced consensus to be achieved.
__label__Evidence	I agree that many people have different platforms to air their opinions these days, in fact it is very easy to create fake identities,  and posts.
__label__Position	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__Position	cost of living, NHS, immigration
__label__Evidence	Couldn't agree more 
__label__Position	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__Position	"While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some ""memes"" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as ""memes"" containing racism and sometimes  the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230"
__label__Position	The nature itself correct the human inflicted changes and balance the climate. But the human should bear the losses in this process
__label__Evidence	but conservatives have spend your taxes on scandals!
__label__Evidence	-links showing other sites are a great way to show hateful infos in a coversation
__label__Position	Also, addressing the threats posed by Russia, China and Iran in a robust fashion.
__label__Position	We should make sure the personal details are acquired before commenting
__label__Evidence	I don't believe that anybody who had the capacity to give rise to fake news can do something more powerful than commenting, and I think that filters being put into place would be more productive than completely eliminating to option to comment - this phenomenon will always exist and can easily take place on other platforms regardless
__label__Position	Rent prices need to be capped, they are in so many other countries
__label__Position	100% with you on this one.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speech in the comments section, newspapers need to employ moderators on their platforms so that there can be someone watching and removing all types of hate speech in the comments section.
__label__Evidence	i guess you could pretend that everything is great
__label__Evidence	i think more moderators are needed for this - and i don't think it means we live in a nanny state as i'm sure others will say.
__label__Evidence	I think the small boats issue is a big distraction. We heavily rely on migrant workers to do jobs in the UK that others don't want to do or don't have the necessary skills to do. Govt needs to focus on training schemes for unemployed young people to give them the skills we need. Any debate on immigration is about small boats, which represents about 1% of overall immigration. Since Brexit, as a nation we can't deport people back to the country in Europe where they first entered (as we could when in the EU). Spending billions on the Rwanda scheme is total nonsense] 
__label__Evidence	Without the option for comments, the news providers become the sole voice of an opinion.
__label__Position	For me one of the key things has been housing, the economy, migration and culture
__label__Evidence	Common sense is not common
__label__Evidence	Things have gone crazy and the need for foodbanks is exploding 
__label__Position	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__Evidence	pro
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should be responsible, if they do not control the atmosphere of their commentary they will be believed to agree to any negative comments made.
__label__Evidence	Moderators are the best way to monitor the content commented combined with a system that flags censored words
__label__Evidence	Well then what is your proposition
__label__Evidence	Avoids AI filtering out free speech
__label__Position	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__Evidence	If facts are given sources should be used to back this up.
__label__Position	The Issue of Immigration is a top priority to me, also I would consider the cost of living and taxes.
__label__Evidence	Seconded.
__label__Position	It can be reduced by warning people of the actions which will be taken by the newspaper article if they come across hate speech comments.
__label__Position	electric vehicles should be consider as mandatory by the major fuel consumption nations
__label__Position	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__Position	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__Evidence	100% agree, especially with the comment about immigrants being blamed
__label__Position	We need to get rid of sunak
__label__Position	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!
__label__Evidence	Immigration affects all those issues
__label__Position	This evidence suggests steps can be taken to reduce hate crime, and maybe websites should take this into account, as Romania, which does not have these models in place, have higher hate crime online. However, how do we know this isn't just a cultural difference, rather than the efficacy of reducing hate crime in other countries?
__label__Evidence	Agreed, seeing the numbers of people sleeping in corridors on a recent trip to A&E is shocking
__label__Position	Rules still need to be made and active moderation should also occur but. a lack of comment section can also reduce space for fake news. However, newspapers also post fake news sometimes so the comment section can allow people to reflect on this.
__label__Position	Think about it life has not been on earth as we know for a very long time, maybe 50- 60 thousand years. The earth has been around for what a trillion years. So what will go first. Lets call it what it is, not attempt to save the earth but to save life on earth. I am pretty sure the earth will be here long after life has been erased from its surface. 
__label__Position	I think any form of hate speech should be hidden into the sensitivity folder and automatically deleted from the comment section
__label__Position	immigration, environment and NHS
__label__Evidence	And what good will that exactly do?
__label__Evidence	Agree, but think we should pay MP's more to offset this and to attract actual competent people to the role.  Too many see the role of MP as a gateway to feathering their own nest.  Pay more and get genuine people who have a desire to serve a common good. 
__label__Position	by using a moderator to flag hate speech in the comments
__label__Position	You can reduce hate speech from newspapers websites by having it properly monitored.  Any hate speach written gets automatically removed.
__label__Position	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Evidence	'Free speech' does not mean the freedom to hurt others. It isn't a licence to offend and should definitely be regulated.
__label__Evidence	I totally agree. I am hearing more people getting fed up with our country. We need to be able to speak out and not be afraid 
__label__Position	Tax, immigration, public services
__label__Position	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored
__label__Position	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__Evidence	there should be notifications when someone is discussing with yr opinion LOL 
__label__Position	Comments could be checked for hate speech before going live.
__label__Position	In a facilitated discussion, the facilitator assists the parties to prepare for and engage in a conversation around the issues that are causing conflict. A facilitator will assist each party individually to: Identify the issues that are at stake; ... Prepare to have a conversation with the other person about the issues. 
__label__Position	The best solution would be to make people identify themselves to the host of the site, but not publicly unless they give consent. Moderators should be used to ban hate speech.
__label__Position	the comment section should be monitored by real people on a regular bases and any accounts found to be using hate speech banned permanently.
__label__Position	hear is a study based on this, worth a read https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Position	I believe nowadays a lot of solutions exist to help moderate content if newspaper are not able to create and manage their own. For example solution like the one attached below are something you can start using immediately: https://viafoura.com/content-moderation/
__label__Position	The problem with trying to regulate hate speech on the internet is that the internet is too big. There is a grey line between hate speech and freedom of speech and it often differs based on where you are from. The internet is not always bound by strict speech laws of one specific countries. Focus should also be placed on how people should react to hate speech and educate them on appropriate responses to such. https://theconversation.com/the-challenge-of-drawing-a-line-between-objectionable-material-and-freedom-of-expression-online-108764
__label__Evidence	I think closing some more loopholes that are used for tax avoidance would be good if acted upon, but wealthy will always find a way around the rules I guess.  I am not sure the argument that they would all leave is true either.
__label__Position	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__Evidence	Not having a billionaire for a Prime Minister will be a good first step 
__label__Evidence	I agree. Users should be able to to flag harmful comments and report them to a moderator. Users can also counteract damaging comments by refuting the content of the comment, for example, by refering to reliable sources
__label__Position	By writing article that promote inclusion and diversity for all races before publishing
__label__Position	Whether the political party generally aligns with my values
__label__Position	Sustainable efforts reduce and reverse the global warming trend.
__label__Evidence	Yes, I totally agree with this. Actually, I think this might be the solution to this problem. If comments are moderated before they go public then there is no chance that offensive and inappropriate comments will make it to the public comments section.
__label__Position	who can handle the economy, balance the books and deal with businesses and governments abroasd
__label__Position	Removing hate speech comments before publishing them. remove peple who post hate speech
__label__Position	There is a fine line between free speech and hate speech. I don't think there is any way to reduce this because people will take the stand and say that their free speech is being taken away from them.
__label__Evidence	Countries still catching up to the industrial revolution will argue it unfair.
__label__Position	Block online haters. If someone is making negative or hateful comments on your posts or account, or is cyberbullying, block them. If they’re threatening you, tell your parents, report it to the platform, and take screenshots.
__label__Position	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is  from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__Position	The economy/cost of living crisis and the NHS. Also how believable and realistic the manifestos actually are
__label__Position	The comment section should have moderators that instill standards that participants have to follow.
__label__Position	comments should be allowed on newspaper articles so that people can have a discussion and express their opinions, regulation would ultimately ensure that everything is kept in order.
__label__Evidence	fully agree - there is zero trust in out politition across the scale
__label__Position	I agree but it has been so run into the ground i don't knwo how we are going to get it back to a good place to live and work again .
__label__Position	I am also concerned about child poverty and the inequality in UK society
__label__Evidence	Having comments has shown that readers engage more in the argument https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Position	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__Position	Active moderation of comment sections can be used to remove hate speech whilst maintaining spaces for civil discussion.
__label__Evidence	regulation means a safe space
__label__Evidence	yes but it's not just about pouring money into the NHS. Surely it needs reform?
__label__Position	https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/25/is-it-really-a-good-idea-to-turn-for-news-websites-to-turn-off-comments
__label__Position	put news in polite ways and try to be civil and lastly put yourself in their shoes
__label__Evidence	in what way?
__label__Evidence	i totally agree, they have been so corrupt
__label__Position	Many children and teens don’t want to be a part of negative behavior like name-calling, criticizing, bullying, and cyberbullying. Dealing with haters isn’t that different from dealing with bullying and cyberbullying. Teens who feel overwhelmed by all the drama on social media will often unfriend or unfollow people online to disengage.
__label__Position	Decent management of public services so the general public gets value.  A lot of tax payer money is wasted due to poor management.
__label__Position	economy, NHS, integrity
__label__Evidence	But on the other hand, peoples opinions matter, it allows us to learn from each other when it is truly done right
__label__Evidence	The economy was better when we were in the EU
__label__Position	There must be a tool that detects hate speech on the websites
__label__Position	Removing the comment space from newspapers infringes on on freedom of speech, a sure way to combat this is by eliminating anonymity.
__label__Position	the availability and affordability of housing 
__label__Position	makes it easier to get a gp appointment
__label__Position	MPs cannot have second jobs unless they need to continue practice to keep their skills etc uptodate eg doctors
__label__Position	Pro
__label__Evidence	However a view point can be expressed appropriately as a constructive criticism by the target audience. Therefore you could argue that anyone who engages in hate speech is the wrong audience.
__label__Position	It is only with free speech we gain knowledge and approach the truth. We need to become familiar with a variety of beliefs and opinions in the world. We can reduce hate speech in newspapers by providing a logical and coherent argument against those who express it, rather than promoting a 'cancel culture'.
__label__Evidence	Simpler communication can help citizens better understand and engage with the EU
__label__Position	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__Position	Close the tax loop holes and put more resource into tackling tax avoidance/evasion
__label__Position	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.
__label__Position	I think will be fair to eliminate the space because everyone needs to give their opinion so it must be better to come up with a solution to block those who post hate speech
__label__Position	newspapers are unlikely to policy it as no publicity is bad publicity to them. the more engagements they get, the better.
__label__Position	Yes it can avoid a lot of arguments and harrasments
__label__Position	"They didn't do it to censor ""hate speech"", they have used it as a way to censor what people are talking about.  Like vaccine side-effects, mass corruption and the propaganda campaign of the last few years.  How can we FAIRLY do this?  The only way is to remove ALL speech instead of going to so much effort to only allow certain people to talk about whatever the accepted narrative is at the time.  The concept of hate speech is a joke and how it has been abused as a means to silence anyone who goes against the narrative is plain for everyone to see.  So no need for convoluted software and systems and ridiculous ways of only allowing certain things to be said, just remove it altogether and stop pretending we aren't in some communist world order."
__label__Position	people should be taught how to be kind and the implications of how their words could affect other people.
__label__Evidence	Let's hope they win.
__label__Evidence	If opinions are given it should be clear they are opinions and not facts.
__label__Evidence	It will avoid people upsetting others.
__label__Position	"For some people, ""Man made climate change"" begs the question. While I might not be one of them, I'll say assuming climate change is indeed man made, all we can do is reduce our greenhouse gas generation. This will require the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to be prioritized more than it currently is. "
__label__Position	Limit anonymity in public discussions and employ a system of moderation.
__label__Evidence	yes so that people can say their views
__label__Position	I agree it is going to need a world effort to combat climate change. Not just a few rich countries trying to.
__label__Evidence	The Biden administration has not taken concrete actions to support peace
__label__Position	everyone has the right to freedom of speech even if we do not agree to their view of opinion but in the end it creates so much hate amongst other commentators as well.
__label__Position	The way the country has been driven into the ground over the last few years, the lies, the selfish nature and cash grab the country has seen, my main concern has been to get rid of the current government
__label__Evidence	However, by doing that you may be limiting people's ability to express themselves positively too
__label__Evidence	This is a great idea balances everything
__label__Evidence	I think the whole concept of hate speech is nonsense and completely hypocritical.
__label__Position	1. No one should be exempt from the right to free speech
__label__Position	I think that if we don't do something to start combatting climate change today, literally nothing will be there in the future to worry about - no economy left if there's no livable Earth left to inhabit. We're going to have to address this at some point, why not now? I'm not convinced that we can reverse what has already been done (ie, extinct species), but we can change the course of the future. 
__label__Evidence	"""Enticing people coming out of school to get into the sector, we need to make it sexy"" (Paul Norman)"
__label__Evidence	People should be able to read things they don't like or agree with.
__label__Evidence	"People may not freely divulge what they actually think if they know they can be tracked down and ""re-educated""!"
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech does not include hate speech.
__label__Position	It's good to have healthy debates with people from different backgrounds and can lead to improved understanding and a different perspective.
__label__Position	We should have a clear definition for hate speech in order to regulate the comment section. For example, comments suggesting certain groups be harmed or should not exist, and language that suggests these groups are inferior without providing educational evidence. We need to keep the comment section a place of discussion and education.
__label__Position	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology 
__label__Position	A strong economy is key as without money, the government is limited in what it can do. I am  concerned that a focus on net zero is too extreme,
__label__Evidence	I agree that human moderators are necessary to reduce hate speech. However, I am concerned that not all websites may have the necessary financial and staffing resources to implement human moderation. I like that submitting personal information is necessary as a cost-effective means to reduce hate speech. However, I hope that the personal information will be verified, and the information will be used to promote change rather than to punish individuals. In this regard, laws may be necessary to protect online commentators.
__label__Position	Education, health and work.
__label__Evidence	Has to be this. Anyone but the Tories (and Reform but they have no chance)
__label__Position	The Council of Foreign relations says that there is a rise in violence linked to hate speech on social media (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons). They say there is a range of attitudes to managing this in different countries, but all agree that something must be done. Free speech may be impinged, but avoiding these real-world, offline consequences is imperative.
__label__Evidence	I agree, however the issue then becomes 'How do we go about finding the root cause '
__label__Position	Government should impose some rules on the people to protect the environment . It may say every one must use electric vehicles, every home must have minimum no of trees grown to counteract the man made damage
__label__Evidence	Completely agree
__label__Position	Immigration, NHS, defence
__label__Position	The state of public services
__label__Position	the high cost of living and mortgage rates
__label__Position	No, I think limiting people's capacity to comment would simply add a new layer to the hate feeling. Plus, it takes away the possibility of capturing perceptions on sensible topics. Fact identifiers though, could be useful to avoid disinformation.
__label__Position	I think this is a good idea and suggest similar ideas.
__label__Evidence	I agree, this has been seen on platforms in the past. This article about an online horse game shows an example of a moderation team going a little 'mad with power', being more harsh when dealing with mentions of politics they personally disagree with (banning people who mention being LGBT but not banning those saying similar things which imply them to be straight) https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2020/3/21/horse-isle-3-war-crimes-and-lgbtq-visibility-a-case-study-in-how-not-to-approach-community-management
__label__Evidence	This is partially true, but fails to account for the fact that we couldn't possibly plant enough trees to absorb all of the CO2 produced. Not enough space on the Earth. And methane.  
__label__Evidence	we're voting for the best of a bad bunch really 
__label__Position	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.
__label__Evidence	prevents people being upset,
__label__Position	Hate speech is everywhere, not just in the newspaper
__label__Position	the crisis in the NHS is the main issue concerning me, closely followed by the cost of living crisis
__label__Evidence	the uk has one of the highest tax rates . somone over 40k is living paycheck to pay check 
__label__Evidence	I agree with this because as much as one has freedom of speech, be mindful of others and do not be disrespectful
__label__Position	I would say i agree with DamianC, in as much as control can be implicated to have order, we end being biased in allowing some to share their opinions and some to be blocked off, essentially we just need to respect one another.
__label__Position	Ensure monitorisation of comments by the publisher, to ensure hate speech is tackled. This should not involve deleting comments that are on the other side of debate however.
__label__Position	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship.  I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it.  Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.  Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy.  They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__Evidence	Starmer is way too woke.  Sadly I can see he will end up in no. 10 
__label__Position	I am fed up with parties just looking for power rather than dealing with long term problems
__label__Evidence	Some people may turn bitter due to being told what they should and shouldn't do.
__label__Position	You can't reduce hate speech because it's a societal problem and not a technological problem.
__label__Evidence	According to a recent survey by Morningconsult, 80% of people want to see all forms of hate speech removed.   https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/social-media-firms-moderate-content/
__label__Evidence	I am a single mom who has worked extremely hard to support my kids on my own and I'm sick and tired of people on benefits getting everything handed to them. Not to mention all the illegal immigrants 
__label__Evidence	Totally agree if there wasnt a box to comment it would stop a lot of this
__label__Evidence	What happens if they are detected falsely using hate speech
__label__Evidence	Same here, but I have decided for change, and my postal vote has gone in!
__label__Position	your opinion does not mean you should give hatred towards others as there is always a way to put your point politely
__label__Evidence	Free speech should never be curtailed.  But how due you suggest you address the root cause of the problem?
__label__Position	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__Position	There will be a focus on evidence-based policymaking and aggregating citizen input
__label__Evidence	brexit has been a disaster. At the very lease, some sort of trade deal with the EU needs to be reached.
__label__Evidence	Not all scientists input is put into the public eye and if a scientist is against the propaganda than they just eliminate him from being heard
__label__Position	Better moderation, and less promotion of comments that make outlandish and inflammatory statements.
__label__Position	I used to vote Green because I care about the environment. Now they rarely mention that - they seem more concerned about men who think they are women and prioritise them over the rights of women and girls
__label__Evidence	I agree. Although the national living wage has increased it has not increased in line with the cost of everything else  increasing
__label__Position	I believe that whilst we all want solutions, I honestly don't think any party has the capability to achieve.
__label__Position	So who will it be when the votes are collected? 
__label__Evidence	I  think its very easy to say this but what is the alternative?
__label__Evidence	but people who do not have you interests at heart will... not a wise move. Any selection is better than none surely>
__label__Evidence	yes, hate speech criteria should be overlooked and set by a credible outside source.
__label__Evidence	there is no way anyone can buy these days without help
__label__Evidence	I agree with the statement, however in this article https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea they speak about different countries laws and UN laws. The difficulties in combatting hate speech on such a universal level is there is not a solid agreement from the world on what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it.
__label__Evidence	Its true that the old way we used to read newspapers were without comments so we should just do that now online to stop all the hate speech.
__label__Position	"For those wanting to respond you need to click not the ""give your opinion"" button before typing"
__label__Position	economic growth
__label__Evidence	The same technology that allows social media to galvanise democratic activists can be used by hate groups seeking to organise and recruit. It also allows fringe sites, including peddlers of conspiracies, to reach audiences far broader than their core readership. Online platforms’ business models depend on maximising reading or viewing times. Since Facebook and similar platforms make their money by enabling advertisers to target audiences with extreme precision, it is in their interests to let people find the communities where they will spend the most time.https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Evidence	I don't think these are all realistic goals.
__label__Position	We need more transparency and measurement of sustainability in food systems
__label__Position	Those who are found to be using hate speech can be banned for a period of time from commenting on posts
__label__Position	I have heard that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference Closes with Limited Ambition
__label__Position	I think that people should be able to express their views, but there has to be some moderation in place to avoid any hate speech.  Removing the comments section from newspapers might encourage people to go to other sources to write their opinions and it could create even more hate speech against the topic as well as the newspaper.  if it is moderated at the source, then the haters can be dealt with there and others will be able to give their opinions.
__label__Position	I have also heard that removing the cap on child benefit (to no more than 2 children) would be a significant game changer in reducing poverty.
__label__Evidence	Would be difficult to implement and may not solve underlying cultural issues
__label__Position	MPs and political parties have to be transparent on who funds them
__label__Evidence	It has also been suggested, that there is an urgent need to engage with influential stakeholders. Therefore focusing on poorer and excluded communities, the so-called ‘hard to reach' may not deliver the highest possible level of cuts in carbon emissions for the resources spent. 
__label__Position	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far.

__label__Evidence	its costing the country 8 million a day
__label__Evidence	setting a team aside to check for hate speech is the solution and removing it
__label__Evidence	"There's a phenomenon called ""online disinhibition effect"", that explain why people get more aggressive online that they would be in real life. https://www.kqed.org/education/532334/is-the-internet-making-you-meaner#:~:text=This%20phenomenon%20is%20known%20as,in%20face%20to%20face%20conversations."
__label__Position	i believe it is neccessary to name and shame users to use hate speech but unfortunately some will tend to use fake names and profiles
__label__Position	Housing is a major issue
__label__Evidence	fully agree - this country has changed for the worse over a very short period of time - just stop the boats - how hard can it be really - how much are we taxpayer paying to fund these economic migrants?
__label__Evidence	AI is a good solution but it can not detect hate speech that is in certain languages, currently AI can not translate all the languages spoken in the world.
__label__Evidence	Comments should be allowed as they give readers a chance to express their feelings and mention the type of news that they enjoy reading
__label__Evidence	I agree, we should rethink deeply the meaning of democracy in the modern era. It is not just about voting, democracy is not just about voting and we should find ways to communicate this to people and policymakers
__label__Position	the newspaper websites should have a moderator who has to approve or an algorithm that would check any comment before it is posted should make sure it does not inclue any hate speech
__label__Position	The EU should continue providing financial support to Palestinian institutions
__label__Position	I have no problem with peope coming into the country to work, however, I would like them to be fully vetted first
__label__Position	Cost of living, housing crisis, Palestine, the NHS
__label__Evidence	Allowing the right to protest.
__label__Position	I think the immigration is gonna be one of the biggest political issue that are  going to shape how people vote
__label__Evidence	knife crime, especially with teenagers is especially scary 
__label__Evidence	It's actually not : https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Evidence	Veganism is a choice, it should not be forced - especially to children
__label__Position	A lot of people may lose their jobs due to AI
__label__Evidence	When moderators have to approve all comments before they get posted you might create an environment where comments the moderator does not agree with do not get posted at all. The better option in my opinion would the second one where you allow readers to flag inappropriate comments, together with a moderator team reviewing these comments. In that case there is a public consensus and more transparency.
__label__Evidence	"Awareness campaigns would not suffice. Real methods could be implemented to reduce (white supremacist) hate speech: ""White supremacist speech is readily detectable, Hemphill says, detailing the ways it is distinguishable from commonplace speech in social media, including:     Frequently referencing racial and ethnic groups using plural noun forms (whites, etc.)     Appending “white” to otherwise unmarked terms (e.g., power)     Using less profanity than is common in social media to elude detection based on “offensive” language     Being congruent on both extremist and mainstream platforms     Keeping complaints and messaging consistent from year to year"" https://news.umich.edu/hate-speech-in-social-media-how-platforms-can-do-better/"
__label__Position	Immigration for sure as well as crime
__label__Position	"Hate speech should be flagged, hidden and the user should be given a strike. People should be able to still view those comments with a ""trigger warning"" disclaimer. After 3 strikes the user should be banned from commenting. But they should still be able to view the newspaper so that they don't miss an article that probably would have helped that particular person to change their behavior . More safe and reliable ways of verifying accounts should also be implemented."
__label__Position	All the posts should be checked before being posted and verified by some sort of AI. Hate speech could affect a person's livelihood and mental state
__label__Position	reform the house of lords
__label__Position	Tax burden plus unresolved issue of people smugglers crossing the channel 
__label__Evidence	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree, the NHS is in an awful state currently
__label__Evidence	"Have you heard of the Scunthorpe problem? It is the fallacy of exactly this argument. If somebody wants to say something, they will find a way. Let's say ""tomato"" was a word that the algorithm blocked. An algorithm which isn't aggressive enough wouldn't block ""tom**o"" or ""2m8o"", etc. Even if these were blocked, users could decide on a euphemism which everybody means knows ""tomato"". Let's say they choose ""vine"". If the algorithm is too aggressive, then a friendly discussion on French vineyards would be impossible! See if you can see why it's called the Scunthorpe problem!"
__label__Evidence	I agree to some extent. I think there are some obvious exceptions but otherwise anytime someone disagrees they can say they find it offensive or hateful and want it removed. You can't exist in a happy thoughts only bubble
__label__Evidence	the public should be able to give their opinions, if you try and stop it they will always find a way to make their voice heard and this is when thigs could get nasty with hate speech.
__label__Evidence	This can hinder the increase of hate speech by filtering out the hate words
__label__Position	Having comments be reviewed before they get posted would help - if the newspaper doesn't have enough resources to have someone manually review all comments, then some kind of automated solution filtering out certain keywords could be implemented.
__label__Position	We need to adapt food systems to big changes, especially climate change
__label__Evidence	Completely agree! Better education and more regulation is needed
__label__Position	Also they all seem to spend all the time having a go at each other instead of telling us what we need to know about what they are going to do and how they are going to pay for it.
__label__Position	Remove text box, but put reactions instead.
__label__Evidence	AI could end up preventing speech that does not qualify as hate speech.
__label__Evidence	But then no-one can give useful positive advice
__label__Position	We need to shift to a more plant-based diet in Europe
__label__Position	The NHSand the cost of living
__label__Evidence	I think so too. But would that not further allow for subjectivity to cloud ones judgement(the moderator)? I propose there be a guideline set as to what qualifies for hate speech, both by law and by the standards of the newspaper. That guideline should be posted in the newspaper or on the social media platforms and that will ensure that there is no grey area on the matter.
__label__Evidence	It is one way or the other their responsibility to police it, because it is their platform the hate speech is taken place and they would be the first point to check that and eliminate those speeches.
__label__Position	Educate people not to use hate speech
__label__Evidence	The scots already had their independence vote - do you want to keep running one until you get the answer you want?
__label__Position	If considering implementing content moderation, using AI may be the best solution for popular sites with a lot of engagement. Especially for filtering out explicit words and phrases, which would be the most unbiased type of moderation. There will of course be those who try to evade the filtering by using special characters in place of letters, but there could be a setting that automatically filters instances of too many special characters, as it could be considered as spam. See article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/14/the-growing-role-of-ai-in-content-moderation/?sh=3f6abc9d4a17
__label__Evidence	hate speech affects people differently, it might not affect some but it differently hurt others
__label__Position	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__Position	i maintain my position in saying that algorithms can be used to identify hate speech. It's important to adhere to the rights of the readers and give them a way to express their opinions,otherwise how else could the newspaper get feedback?
__label__Evidence	Absolutely, and primarily any action has to be taken by civil society. There are examples of good practice within voluntary and non-governmental organisations but these are not yet common practice. The scale and balance of power needs to shift and resources found to develop this work as part of a core purpose.
__label__Position	I am still very reluctant to vote as I don't believe either sides arfe likely to bring about real change
__label__Position	Defence, net zero, NHS and politicians reluctance to say what they really intend
__label__Evidence	Policy changes often face resistance from powerful industry lobbies
__label__Position	I found this interesting article on how the United Nations suggests people react to hate speech directed at them or their organisation.  https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	I dont know
__label__Position	labour have no clear strategies
__label__Position	i think one can filter the comment so that only the comment that show love are seen by people
__label__Position	I support labour but did not vote previously as it is a wasted vote where I live. I support the NHS
__label__Evidence	This should prevent such comments from being printed, but I think any attempt to 'educate' such persons is totally futile. They are hard-wired to hold that point of view, often drilled into them by parents/caregivers.
__label__Position	Getting the conservative party out of government and voting to improve the NHS and cost of living.
__label__Position	More suitable laws need to be put in place that are suited to the world of social media
__label__Position	Have slurs programmed in as keywords so that comments which feature them are not published.
__label__Position	you have to hold people accountable don't let them hide behind anonymous usernames if they are hoing to say hateful things let everyone know the kind of person they are
__label__Evidence	I Disagree, modern software technology is capable of knowing when to filter out post being made by the public. A system can be integrated as too where if a  post achieves a certain threshold of flagged/reported tickets; there post would and can be immediately shut down.
__label__Evidence	I disagree - these policies must be mandated otherwise when they are voluntary (like in the UK now) people don't wear them - as a result infection rates remain high 
__label__Evidence	That would be very helpful
__label__Position	We ought to strike some balance by protecting other people at the same time and thus I am of the opinion that while we may be engaging to almost everyone we should have an algorithm in place that will help us filter out dangerous comments. At the end of the day, what we do not need are hateful comments therefore we should not dismiss along with positive comments that may help our society investigate certain areas of our lives that need critical attention.
__label__Position	85% of hate crimes are against groups that cannot change their identity. That's ethnicity/race, gender, sexuality and disability. These groups should not be verbally assulted for what they cannot change about themselves. https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics
__label__Evidence	I agree.  People should not stay silent through fear of someone taking offence at what they say.  How can people figure out what their viewpoints are on things if they aren't allowed to ask questions are think aloud?
__label__Position	If you want change the only party that can do this is Reform otherwise it will just be more of the same
__label__Position	preferences for extreme ethical opinions
__label__Evidence	I don't necessarily agree, but I can see why a person may not be voting tomorrow. Keir Starmer's Labour is a  Lite version of Conservatism. 
__label__Position	If you see an opportunity to add value to the person who left the comment, or perhaps explain your intention in a way that they can understand it better, go ahead and respond with love, patience, and in a way that adds value to the conversation
__label__Position	the general level of corruption and vulgar discourse in the political process
__label__Position	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__Evidence	i think so,people should be able to express their views but comments must be moderated
__label__Position	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63291527
__label__Evidence	False information can then be removed, as well as with any comments that are harmful
__label__Position	I think when you report try to be polite and ask yourself what a reader can learn from this.
__label__Position	There will be a focus on openness, transparency, and interoperability in deliberative technologies
__label__Evidence	I would not want to see people suffering through hatespeech being allowed under the guise of freedom of speech. It is an excuse to allow hate.
__label__Position	This area must be monitored. This may include having an option to report someone's comment, so that it can be reviewed for insulting and derogatory behaviour.
__label__Position	We need to tailor communication to different audiences while maintaining a consistent core message
__label__Evidence	But are moderators available to this? And who agrees what can be said and what can't be?
__label__Evidence	This is exactly what should happen in all comments section! Only then people will learn to be respectful of others
__label__Position	Is there anything else in this survey? 
__label__Position	"Numerous positions have already been provided and the following represents my summary/reconcilliation of said positions: IF the objective is to *reduce* hate speech without eliminating the opportunity for readers to comment, we must be careful and consider our options with forethought. Others have mentioned before that the authomatic censorship on the basis of keywords is a convenient, one-time-implementation approach to reducing hate speech. On this, I agree. Certain words (unambiguously profane or mired in hatred) should trigger the system to not post a comment (and further, shadowban a given user for some determined amount of time [or post attempts]). Software is not a substitute for human judgement, though, and there are always ways for people to circumvent software-based enforcement (e.g., simply writing profanity with punctuation between letters so as to still convey the same hateful message). Thus, *some* degree of human intervention is necessary. Having said that, the use of human moderators is also prone to certain flaws (someone mentioned personal bias; I mentioned emotional labour, burnout, and high turnover on the part of the moderators). One option that has some historic precedent is to crowdsource the task of regulating content (e.g., as in the case of Reddit, wherein the audience has the ability to ""upvote"" or ""downvote"" individuals' responses. This is not without its flaw as it may quickly spiral into a hivemind type situation (furthermore, ad populum is indeed a logical fallacy). We are also reminded that ""letting the free market decide what happens"" is a dangerous game. What I'd advise, therefore, is at least a tri-partite solution: The use of software to automatically screen and filter out the most heinous of comments that happen to include inexcusable hate-words, a public that has the power to upvote/downvote, and a moderation team that has the authority to overide the former two (in case a perfectly legitimate but unpopular post is racking up downvotes simply for going against the status quo despite not necessarily being hateful in intention). A TEAM of moderators will reduce the probability that any one single person's bias is unduly influencing a given decision. This is NOT a perfect solution, but I think it attempts to incorporate the goodness of many other solutions previously mentioned."
__label__Evidence	I agree, it should not be removed but rather directed
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is a fascist fallacy. I love readers comments but there has to be very strict controls to control hate speech. I agree with the suggestions to have monitoring of comments by AI; able to be reported on by other users; and only allow registered site users to post comments.
__label__Evidence	These investments don't all have to be a negative thing - they can lead to massive job growth and prosperity, if designed and implemented correctly.  
__label__Position	Reflecting on my comments, I believe hate speech should still be removed from the platform by modorators monitoring the comments section - the use of foul language / any form of racism, homophobia, name calling or any other general hate speech should result in a ban for specific users after a warning has been issued.
__label__Position	The economy, the environment, stopping the asset stripping
__label__Position	I think we all need to gather our communities and apply pressure on policy makers to address these issues with urgency
__label__Evidence	I do believe that removing the comment section is the right thing to do. even though some may see it as restricting free speech
__label__Position	"""Planning policy focusing on harm is unhelpful, there may not necessarily be harm"" (Esther Robinson)"
__label__Evidence	What are the root causes?
__label__Evidence	An algorithm in itself can be bias and discrimatory as proven by studies, it also may not take into consideration different languages
__label__Position	Requiring users to login and provide personal data (as you would with any website you sign up to) in order to comment. Then have the website monitior IP addresses to see if multiple accounts are being used for hate speech.
__label__Position	I agree that challenging hate speech is important and can see how the arguments for non-moderated but automated filtering systems discussed earlier might seem to make sense, on the surface but, if anything, the failure of these systems across the web to filter out hate speech is the reason human moderation is necessary fro any comments section, especially for a newspaper, where people often pay more attention to the comments than the contents.
__label__Evidence	its a myth... no proof. also weather records going back several decades is nothing compared to the age of the earth.
__label__Evidence	The media should not be in control of what we view, though. And I can see the side of your thinking. Perhaps with the option to view said removed comments makes this more plausible for you? I wonder how that changes your opinion, if at all of course.
__label__Evidence	yes true i find no one really reads those comments anyways
__label__Evidence	It should be done like a spam filter
__label__Evidence	"Someone's belief that a marginalised group doesn't deserve rights is far different from having a different opinion on something like the ending of a loved TV show. It should not be the responsibility of those hurt from harmful rhetoric to ""be the bigger person"" and ignore it when it has been proven that hate speech leads to acts of extreme violence"
__label__Position	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__Position	A way to combat the root issue of hate speech is to educate people. On the newspaper site there could be resources to inform people of how harmful hate speech really is. We can also educate people on our differences and how to celebrate these rather than turn against eachother. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__Evidence	I am not sure who is responsible for enforcing the legislation?
__label__Evidence	but the amount of comments is what puts too much of a strain on moderators
__label__Position	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__Position	People should be allowed frredom of speech, but monitored or moderated somehow to looks for patterns of trolling behaviour
__label__Evidence	Professionality
__label__Evidence	Also it's not about restricting any form of hate speech, we also need to be reminded that our opinions can't be the only right one. Hate speech is hate, and a crime against who ever is being undermined
__label__Evidence	I tend to agree.
__label__Position	Are they telling the truth?
__label__Position	"One alternative is the so called watching-eye effect. It is known that ""under watching eyes"", people tend to present less antisocial behavior, and a higher comment quality in these comment sections.  Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0144929X.2022.2114937"
__label__Position	The treatment of socialists and the left in general under starmers labour
__label__Evidence	Totally agree with this and hopefully most rational people would.
__label__Position	Where children are involved, I think it is necessary to filter out hate speech. Dark comments or 'trolls' can be uneducated, and have opinions that are harmful to the developing brain, or just flat-out 'fake news'.
__label__Position	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__Position	Brexit, the word that most of the parties dont want to talk about
__label__Evidence	Yes the costs are very high and most technologies in the [past have failed such as wind turbines etc which need electricity which cancels the effort
__label__Evidence	Great! I have a similar approach
__label__Position	NHS, cost of living, unemployment, climate change
__label__Evidence	No certificates should be needed to detect a hate comments, it comes to ethics and morality
__label__Position	Getting the Tories out, they've been in charge for too long
__label__Position	NHS Cost of loving and future tax rises
__label__Position	Economy/Cost of living
__label__Evidence	Lockdowns are not the answer to the problem. Look how the lockdowns for the virus have caused the economy to go downhill and the depression and bad effects on the people both socially and psychologically
__label__Evidence	I agree that we have to try. There is no quitting. 
__label__Evidence	It removes the problem of potential hate speech
__label__Evidence	we will not hear other peoples opinion, so this is not a good idea
__label__Position	i think the same that people can comment as long as it is being watched
__label__Evidence	Many user has been learned using words, that algoritm can rotate
__label__Evidence	This are very important issues to me too 
__label__Position	CPO
__label__Evidence	People want to comment about what they've just read on the newspaper, they don't want to go to an external source to talk about it. Why would it be any better sending people elsewhere to do this? There must be a way to educate people as a way to prevent hate speech.
__label__Evidence	There's a labour shortage right now and the adult social care system is heavily reliant on migrant labour. Migrants are also less likely to use the NHS and other public services than non-migrants 
__label__Evidence	I think this intrudes on free speech and is a danger to moderating certain things the newspaper might not want to be affiliated with.
__label__Evidence	That fundamentally isn't the case. I really recommend that you read their manifestos and think more carefully about that
__label__Evidence	People may be unsure what to define as an inappropriate comment, and we cannot guarantee that the comment will be removed
__label__Evidence	I think the lazy brits that sit on their backsides, smoking/vaping and watching Sky tv should get off their backsides and fill these jobs - stop giving them money for doing nothing 
__label__Evidence	A good summary of Britain's failings over the last 14 years.
__label__Evidence	I also agree this is a good solution
__label__Evidence	I agree with you but there would have to be a lot of work put into the filters as people do get around them and still are able to make their hateful points using text speak or misspelling ever so slightly.  This is just something that would have to be considered.
__label__Evidence	yes this absolutly true, newspapers should not be acting like the censorship police
__label__Evidence	How do we coordinate different stakeholders'communications? At EU level, do you feel there are such spaces to enable regular and open commuinication? 
__label__Position	I think there should be a comments section, truthfully reading through these do make me laugh.  But there can be some cruel comments to.  I guess you just need think skin for someone to be in newspapers
__label__Evidence	yeah they can, but certain AI can be added on newspapers websites to detect and remove hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I am unconvinced by any potential leader
__label__Position	I don't think this is possible. We should go back to physical printed newspapers.
__label__Evidence	What does that mean
__label__Position	While I think it's important to reduce hate speech in the comment sections, the question is how, without restricting people to have freedom of speech. In addition, I also think it's important that there are people who monitor and give permission/accept the comment added after it has been observed, while providing reminders on the newspaper sections that comments should be clean, friendly and not rude for reader sensitivity.
__label__Evidence	anyone writing things against the prevailing narrative will be shut down. George Orwell wrote this would happen and women would be the ones easily taken in and become enforcers.
__label__Evidence	It could be tried
__label__Position	climate change madness ;)
__label__Evidence	I love the idea of implementing a filter/moderator so the respectful opinions are still allowed to be shared!
__label__Evidence	You are conflating two issues , enviromnet and climate change
__label__Evidence	You can always talk in person freely or private conversations
__label__Position	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__Evidence	absolutely true growing more trees are the only solution to this problem  
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	newspapers are biased - they don't reflect balanced opinions
__label__Evidence	I would support this fully.
__label__Position	the economy
__label__Evidence	humans are not usually biased
__label__Position	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
