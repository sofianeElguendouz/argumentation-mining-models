__label__Support	I agree that removing the comments section is not a solution to stopping hate speech as this just encourages users to go to different platforms, users need to be able to post their opinions but newspapers should have a responsibility to monitor what is being posted as well as a responsibility on the tone of articles they post online as this can have an effect on the type of comments that users leave as some users will see an article and the tone of the article will make them respond in a controversial way which encourages hate speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	I do not think this is fair on the people who genuinely want to have a fair conversation on the subject.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	As much people have freedom of speech we are also obliged to respect other people whilst doing so.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it.  Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.

__label__Support	This is a very good point. And will make the reading experience pleasant. Another method that can combat hate speech is education.

__label__Attack	Have you actually read the comments on a newspaper article!	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__Support	If the platform is held accountable for allowing hateful speech, then this would set an example to others, both platforms and people, and eventually there would be more control over this happening freely.	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

I'm particularly worries about inaction towards Long Covid patients
__label__Support	It is definitely the way to go. We should not allow hate speech	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__Attack	Im not sure moderation would be the difinitive solution	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__Support	Exactly this - we get what we pay for 	Bulk of immigration problem is from illegal routes which the government has never been bold enough to take the bull by the horns. 
__label__Attack	I feel they do have a responsibility to monitor trolling and abusive behaviour as this can be harmful to others. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.

__label__Attack	its hard to find moderators without bias	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	To read a persons message would be an invasion of privacy	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.

__label__Attack	By total scrapping of the comment section, reporters might get away with misinforming the public therefore they need to be called out right on the spot but in a respectful manner.	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__Attack	Yes however, it would at least stop the effect hate speech has on others	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	I completely agree, it will help avoid people posting offensive comments and allow the comment section space to be a space of productiveness where we learn what our fellow communities think about articles posted	I think newspapers websites should have an online system  that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.

__label__Attack	I do agree with you, but I think the people also should have a way of reporting comments.	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I disagree. Removing the comments section is limiting access to echo chambers, quite literally.	The vast majority of digital news consumers - that is 76% in America, read comments sections. This means by removing them were missing a big chance at limiting the harmful effects of echo chambers and encouraging consumers to think critically and question things

__label__Attack	Not allowing hateful comment does not mean we limit people freedom of speech but promote kindness.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it.

__label__Attack	I have seen this method used online before, but it does tend to hinder discussion with fellow readers.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	"How much hate speech is there really on newspaper comments sections? Usually a difference of opinion is enough for some people to lurch for the ""hate speech"" card in order to get a comment removed because they don't like a different viewpoint."	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__Attack	Readers comments are an accountability tool for curation	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	While I agree that it is free speech, just because it's free speech shouldn't mean it should be allowed especially when its there for everyone to see.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I think this is a bad idea. The comments section is an important means of debunking biased articles or potentially gaining a different perspective on what others think about what you've just read.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	No need to keep on - just do the process properly - were out its done 	We need people in the UK to actually be helped back into work to realise they can earn more money by working than on benefits. There are enough people to make a difference without so many immigrants.

__label__Attack	getting rid of comment sections reduces the change for openness towards the topic, you cannot educate people you can't reach	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	With every right comes responsibly so your right cannot impose on others	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.

__label__Support	"I agree. Some for of moderation is needed. Users should have to agree to some sort of ""anti hate speech"" policy when signing up and accounts who violate the policy (by posting hate speech) should be banned. The moderation can be done similarly to how social media platforms such as Instagram allows users to filter out certain keywords from their comment section and any comments with those words do not appear in the comment section as seen here  ( https://help.instagram.com/700284123459336 )"	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted.

__label__Attack	Eliminating the space for reader comments would be violating free speech, in my opinion it would be much better to have every incident recorded as a Non-crime hate incident'. The government needs to have stricter and clearer laws on what entails hate crime and hate incidents.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	What you are suggesting means that free speech should be limited to those articles that won't generate a conversation.  If you look at  https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/news-sites-that-turn-off-commenting-dont-drive-users-to-social-media-instead/ it shows that restricting or reducing comments can inflame a situation and cause irrational and trolling.	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__Support	Spot on.	it is not something i considered for voting tbh
__label__Attack	have to be careful with banned lists, sometimes they dont do what theyre meant to	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.

And read the rest of the views people are putting here, the whole point of this exercise is asking us for simplistic arguments.

__label__Attack	I totally disagree with this because this sounds like a violation of of the human right to freedom of speech. Also, this means that newspapers will be able to get away with publishing articles that the general public does not agree with without any repercussions.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I think it's difficult to re-educate (so to speak) someone engaging in Hate Speech because the root cause is something within themselves. Unless a newspaper website wanted to fund a dedicated team to address and re-program the life long beliefs and internalised trauma that some racists, homophobes etc hold, then it seems an insurmountable task. The key would be to start at the ground floor and provide affordable therapy, mandatory counselling for offenders, pump more money into diversifying and fortifying the education system...	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Support	Recent congressional hearings have highlighted the chasm between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler convened a hearing in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, saying the internet has aided white nationalism’s international proliferation. “The President’s rhetoric fans the flames with language that—whether intentional or not—may motivate and embolden white supremacist movements,” he said, a charge Republicans on the panel disputed. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Ted Cruz, held a nearly simultaneous hearing in which he alleged that major social media companies’ rules disproportionately censor conservative speech, threatening the platforms with federal regulation. Democrats on that panel said Republicans seek to weaken policies dealing with hate speech and disinformation that instead ought to be strengthened.	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__Attack	The same technology that allows social media to galvanise democratic activists can be used by hate groups seeking to organise and recruit. It also allows fringe sites, including peddlers of conspiracies, to reach audiences far broader than their core readership. Online platforms’ business models depend on maximising reading or viewing times. Since Facebook and similar platforms make their money by enabling advertisers to target audiences with extreme precision, it is in their interests to let people find the communities where they will spend the most time.https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	Newspapers in print have a comments section that you can write in to give your opinions on, but the replies are moderated and checked.

__label__Attack	Simply using a word filter would not be enough.  One of the things that makes hate speech so dangerous is that the people saying it know how to get around word filters to say hateful things without using banned words.

__label__Attack	I agree with your idea. However, there is a thin line between freedom of speech and hate speech. How will it be made more transparent to others what is what?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	This would be a great idea, however, it's also important to take into notice that everyone has their own biased; so one statement could be hate speech to one but not the other	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__Support	I think it is important to a) get the tories out and b) make sure reform dont have too strong a foothold.

They're also responsible for the real world violence as a result of willingly hosting hate speech on their platform whether they're active or inactive on their handling of the comments sections.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	While I see the logic to this argument, the publics interaction with paper newspapers and slower press looks to have declined according to this article, therefore I'm not sure this solution would work: https://clubs.waketech.edu/wake-review/magazine/creative-writing/non-fiction/the-decline-in-newspapers-a-closer-look-joseph-ahrens/	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments.  People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name.  The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously.  This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments.  Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.

__label__Support	I agree. This sounds like a good plan.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.

__label__Attack	Agreed. I found a similar article and the more people feel censored the more hate sites thrive. Instead of a platform where people can engage and educate.	The most surprising position was to completely eliminate the comments section. various studies have been conducted in this regard and they all agree on one thing and that deleting comments is not a good idea and can damage the general perception of the outlet. https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/
__label__Support	Collective ownership and action  	It's still too cold.

__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	This will help the newspaper and community to know which areas affect people the most and help them	I dont think it is a fair choice.  For how long should people be silenced.  Hate speech is always going to be around.  Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.

__label__Attack	I agree that we have to be very careful around censorship. Shutting commentary down because it doesn't fit your agenda or internal narrative can be very dangerous as it is a tool used by dictators.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	This can be a very good 1st level of filtering, and maybe if there are situations which are red-flagged in high intensity, they can go through a human vetting process also.	Discussion during the set-up of this project showed that there may be some significant areas of disagreement between heritage and climate practitioners. One obvious one is installing solar energy systems on older buildings. Deep retrofit may also be problematic. If we are to avoid turning these issues into disputes then it will be important to start by working out where there is consensus. Assuming that we accept the need for net zero then the question is how do we achieve that in situations where current tools for deploying clean energy may not be appropriate. Positive communication will be important to help us all see what good practice looks like and also how we agree for criteria for such practice.
__label__Attack	But is it even possible to fix now or is it too far gone?	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	But how would one be able to determine what is hate speech and what isn’t? For example someone could say the word n*gger in context of a historical discussion. Some black people would consider it hate speech and others wouldn’t. With people deciding what is and what isn’t hate speech with their subjective opinions, genuine non-hatefuelled opinions would not be posted and as a result this method would inhibit free speech unfairly to some degree.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	definately comments section should be monitored before it gets out to the public	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.

Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	Newspapers by their nature are polarised entities. Banning comments to diminish polarised opinions makes little sense if the newspapers themselves are pumping out polarised opinions.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	Yes definitely agree, but unfortunately even with help for a good deposit the house prices are so high that unless you earn a lot, nobody will lend you the remainder you need to borrow	If more people dont vote nothing is going to change - be part of the change. The way I see it is not voting is still making a choice and that is that nothing is going to change. I do see a point of not voting as I personally dont trust someone coming from a priviledged position to vote on my behalf as a minimum wage earner despite having a good and technical job (civil engineering) I cannot vote as funnily enough but if I could Id like to make an informed choice rather than be stuck with one and complain 
__label__Attack	I can see their point of view, however hate speech can't be considered a viewpoint as most times there isn't even a good enough argument to support people that leave hate speech's point of view.	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__Support	Hate speech is complex and jubjective. AI is still developing and not good enough to understand basic debate let alone interpret language, Too easy for AI to take words out of context.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__Support	I totally agree with you. Adding that the comment section must remain closed until the education of the people takes effect. Remembering that the learning process takes time to complete.	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__Support	Fully agree with this!	Investment into the construction sector. I'm not aware of any party having a strong stance that they will incest heavily (and intelligently). Things like HS2 are a great concept and help the economy, but not if the money is wasted on a non starter
__label__Attack	Hate speech can spread rapidly, and destroy lives. It is offensive, hurtful and can ruin people. I think this is a very bad opinion to take.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	There is always going to be fake news, thats what sells. Hate speech is not the same as voicing an opinion.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	This does not remove comments altogether	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__Attack	i dont think its possible to weigh hate speech. different peech hits differently to different people	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	Algorithms are not always accurate	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	"I think people who focus on supposed benefit scroungers are quite easily led, tbh. You're focusing on people at the bottom rather than at the top, and if you really think those at the top all ""earned it through hard work"" you've been had!"	If we are so badly off then why won't the English parties let us have another referendum.  We are so much more worse off because of Brexit which Scotland didn't vote in favour of.

__label__Attack	It can be difficult to monitor everything all the time, but I think if something is reported and not deleted then fair enough.	i think a law should be made that if you do not delete hate speech from your website or article than that newspaper will have to pay a fine.
__label__Support	Is there a particular country that you think does it well and we should model ours on? 	Rebulding the NHS, better education, taxation, honesty and integrity of elected representitives
__label__Attack	Not to be rude, but I doubt people who post hateful comments would care. Imagine someone telling a bully that they're rude - I don't think this would change anything in their behaviour.	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__Attack	Rent caps will deter private landlords entering the market ultimately making the situation worse as there will be less rental properties on the market 	It could increase democratic legitimacy of the Commission

__label__Support	https://www.positivemessengers.net/en/news-en/253-how-to-end-hate-speech-some-good-ideas-that-actually-work.html	Hate speech will always appear on open forums.  The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__Support	It is great to ban them but they would create different profiles again to put out their comments. One good side of this idea is that they would consistently have to do extra work in creating new profiles to put out their hate speeches, and hopefully,  one day they would be tired and give up.	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__Support	I agree. A big importance for newspapers is the comment section and people's opinion to what they have written. Although, the companies should take some responsibility to monitor the comments and what the other users will see.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I think this is a good idea, I would start with education, if that is not helping then restricting the person from commenting.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	newspapers should remain impartial and hate speech leans on an opinion.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	some people would still make hate comments, as they could give a false name to begin with.	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__Support	Agree, Brexit was definitely partially to blame. I do feel some of the people voted that for immigration reasons only...whereas I know numerous people that whilst they voted for Brexit they said it changed nothing and made things worse 	Agreed - in some situations, people choose not to work as they would be financially worse off. That needs changing.
__label__Attack	I agree that some regulation and introduction of the standards of communication is necessary to allow for maintaining comment space open for everybody.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Absolutely, and primarily any action has to be taken by civil society. There are examples of good practice within voluntary and non-governmental organisations but these are not yet common practice. The scale and balance of power needs to shift and resources found to develop this work as part of a core purpose.	We need an action programme to develop a more inclusive sector 
__label__Attack	that requires people who play by the rules	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__Attack	This would be removing freedom of speech. I think that is a very problematic road to go down.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	But who is going to pay for all thee changes? Big business surely will not foot the bill and pour own government in the USA is in so much debt already that we are nearing an economic collapse	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Support	They waste so much money, and there is a lack of joined up thinking across the NHS as a whole. Too much is left to individual trusts.	Develop purpose-driven technology for deliberative democracy
