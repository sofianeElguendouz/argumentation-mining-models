The banks are left with no other option but to take huge haircuts (sometimes even as high as 65%) on the loans recovered. Taxpayers' money is often used to bail out these banks in order to save the economy.	We should fight crony capitalism in India

__label__Attack	Drones are being used in many industries. They go to places where it is difficult for humans to go. For example, they can be used to deliver medicines quickly in hilly regions. Drones can be used to deliver food in times of natural calamities. Not just delivering food, using drones, rescue teams can find people that are stuck and can save them. So, drones can save lives.

We should implement a climate score for products
__label__Support	Urbanization results in increased population density, which leads to pressure on resources such as land, water, medical professionals, and police.	We should fight against urbanization

__label__Support	More population causes a burden on the government and hence it will be difficult to ensure the quality of life for all.	We should fight against urbanization
__label__Support	Due to high demand, land prices, housing prices, and rents will increase drastically. Not everyone can afford the prices. Those who can afford to have to spend a large part of their income on housing. The people who cannot afford to rent in urban areas are forced to live in slums with substandard housing and poor sanitation facilities, which negatively affects the health of people living there.	We should fight against urbanization
__label__Support	NGOs are often America's way of interfering in European elections. NGOs must be policed more vigilantly to prevent America from interfering in our elections.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
__label__Support	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__Support	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.	We should have legal migration channels.

__label__Support	No person should really earn an income from owning land itself, because it is not the result of human labor. Planet Earth is the common inheritance of humanity, why should any human have the right to take a piece of ground and demand payment from someone else for the privilege of using it? The land exists independently of the land owner.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__Support	A land tax would eliminate land speculation because the increase in ground rent would go away in tax.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__Attack	Space mining may be neat science fiction, but I doubt it could ever become a commercially feasible activity. Aside from the environmental impact of launching vehicles into space, moving the mined materials to Earth would pose its own challenges. Entry into the atmosphere and arrival on Earth is dangerous. Having thousands of tons of mined matter go through this process seems destined to end up with frequent disasters.	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__Support	In the hope of becoming rich, many people are burning money to buy overhyped digital art. Many will lose money when people lose interest in buying these NFTs. Some people are saying that NFTs are a bubble that is going to burst.	We should ban NFTs
__label__Attack	NFTs help artists sell their paintings, music, etc. for a good amount of money, which may not be possible before NFTs.	We should ban NFTs
__label__Support	Whenever an NFT was sold or bought, the transaction consumes lots of electricity. This huge energy consumption is a serious issue because we are already fighting against climate change.	We should ban NFTs
__label__Support	Hackers are stealing NFTs. And they are also stealing cryptocurrencies by sending malicious NFTs. Recently, hackers stole $150k worth of crypto from Twitch co-founder’s Fractal NFT project.	We should ban NFTs
__label__Attack	Instead of banning anything, we should create better alternatives. When the high-speed rail line (320 km/h) between Strasbourg and Paris was opened, the number of flights between Stuttgart and Paris dropped dramatically, due to decreasing demand.	We should ban domestic air traffic
__label__Attack	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__Attack	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__Support	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.	We should end illegal pushbacks.

__label__Support	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__Support	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research. This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic. These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__Support	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.	We should criminalize the export of waste
__label__Support	Waste produces negative environmental impacts in the recipient state.	We should criminalize the export of waste
__label__Support	Exported trash is burning for months suffocating local people and wildlife.	We should criminalize the export of waste

__label__Support	Children are made to work in industries with hazardous chemicals, and machines under harsh weather conditions, resulting in physical casualties and many severe diseases.	India needs to address the issue of child labor
__label__Support	Due to a lack of education and proper guidance, they get influenced by criminals and take shortcuts to become rich, and end up committing crimes at a tender age. The rates of juvenile crime cases are increasing day by day in India.	India needs to address the issue of child labor
__label__Support	The number of harassment and child abuse cases has drastically increased in the last few years most of them are sexual abuse cases occurring with girls and boys aged below 15.	India needs to address the issue of child labor
__label__Support	Childhood is the most important phase for the development of physical and emotional abilities. The problem of child labor is stealing childhood from many children. Mere making laws to prevent it doesn’t solve the problem. Implementation of the laws on a war footing is needed.	India needs to address the issue of child labor
__label__Attack	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Support	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Support	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Attack	Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature. Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose. Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Attack	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Support	Feeding or dressing man is no longer an acceptable excuse with the state of knowledge of the “modern” world.	We should end animal abuse
__label__Support	There is little or no educational, conservational, research, or economic benefit derived from wild animals in traditional circuses that might justify their use and the loss of their ability to behave naturally as wild animals.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Support	In circuses, wild animals in circuses are destined to a life of physical abuse and mental torture.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Support	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Support	Circuses are traveling entertainment services moving around Europe, and performing wild animals are transported across Member States, where circuses pose a severe public safety threat.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Attack	As women face violence because of their gender, they need special laws to protect them. But, in general, men do not face physical harassment just because of their gender.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Attack	In India, it is very difficult for women to go to police stations to report crimes against them. Men’s commission may further deter them from approaching courts.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	If a woman is a victim of any sort of harassment and is in a distress, society will more likely to help her. But the same is not true for men. If a man is a victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment, there is no single government entity he can approach to. Moreover, society may make fun of him for being weak. This is the reason married men are twice likely to commit suicide when compared to married women. To address these gender stereotypes and discrimination, there is a need for 'National commission for Men'.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	As per the 2011 census, India has a 51.47% male population. India has a 'Ministry for women & child development', but none of the government entities is working on men’s rights. As India is a democratic country, it is unfair to neglect people based on their gender.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	With better and more stringent mechanisms and laws in place to deal with sexual harassment, rape cases, and domestic violence cases, unfortunately, there have been instances of misuse of the laws to cause harm to innocent men. Setting up a Ministry of Men would at least give such men a chance to make their case. This, in no way, is meant to undermine the case for the protection of women.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	It has been observed that in countries where the sex ratio is skewed against women, crimes against women increase drastically. As can be easily seen in India, crimes against women have been on the rise. Most horrific of all, crimes against minor girls have increased drastically since 2012. This paints a very grim picture of our society as a whole. The highest GDP growth rate amounts to nothing if our society itself is corrupted to the extent that it is right now. India has been a patriarchal society for centuries. To make a shift to an egalitarian society for women in every aspect of life, Indian men need to be re-educated and rehabilitated with the new norms.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	Drug addiction is a menace that has plagued Indian youth in recent years. The majority of drug addicts are males. A ministry of men can help solve the problem of why capable male youth of the country are resorting to such self-destructive activities.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India

__label__Support	As per Article 370, people of other regions cannot buy land or settle in Jammu & Kashmir. This is acting against the development of the region. By abolishing article 370, teachers, doctors, and other professionals can settle there bringing better facilities.

__label__Attack	We were champions of hockey even when we were not independent. We have won Olympic 8 gold medals in Hockey, the highest in any sport. We had a glorious past, and we should work towards restoring it. Making cricket a national game may overshadow hockey.	Cricket should be declared the national game of India
__label__Support	Apart from the raw passion, the money and fame that follows are blinding. Unlike other players of other sports, the cricketers even at the junior levels earn handsomely, which is also a motivating factor that this game ensures financial security provided you play well.	Cricket should be declared the national game of India
__label__Support	India has been performing outstandingly well in cricket for the past 20 years or so. It is the most popular sport in India. Children are madly passionate about it, people are deeply involved in the game, and there is a cricket critic in every Indian house. The BCCI has been successful in brilliantly marketing and encouraging the game as well. BCCI is the richest cricket board in the world and the richest sports controlling authority in India. No sports authority has managed their game so well in India as compared to BCCI. We have won 3 World Cups, 2 Champion Trophies, and many more prestigious tournaments.	Cricket should be declared the national game of India
__label__Attack	Cricket basically originated in England and gained popularity in colonial countries as the English masters used to play. The fine Englishmen used to bat all day and the tiring bowling work was done by the locals of the colonies. This game is a sign of the presence of colonialism.

__label__Attack	everyone should have a right to own cryptocurrency.	We should ban cryptocurrencies

__label__Support	All of Europe has to pay income tax & VAT, except for the Eurocrats. In Belgium, you have to pay 50 % of your salary to the state, unless you work directly for the EU. Is this fair? No, of course not! It is time to make Europe fairer in a very practical and direct way, by abolishing tax exemptions for European politicians and staff.	We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians
__label__Support	It is absolutely ridiculous to be spending money on these climate disastrous practices. The EU is nowhere close to keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement and is still funding unsustainable practices left and right.	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__Support	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model.	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__Attack	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.' The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
__label__Attack	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions. We have the perfectly fine EU Treaties as the foundational documents of the EU. They must be followed to the letter.	We should create a common constitution
__label__Support	Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Attack	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Support	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Support	Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Attack	We should focus more on human welfare. Currently, waste sorting and recycling are degrading human exploitation in sweatshops.	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__Support	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels.	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__Support	giving nuclear energy a green label will encourage the flow of financial resources across the EU toward environmentally sustainable activities	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__Support	Nuclear energy can be considered sustainable because it is cheap and can be predicted for decades, and the price of power produced by nuclear power plants is not affected by changes in the price of natural gas or other energy carriers.	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__Support	Nuclear energy use helps to avoid the release of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants every year, which contribute to the development of acid rain, smog, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__Attack	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps?	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Attack	If Europe is going to have concentration camps again, they should be in Europe, in plain sight, for everyone to see.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Attack	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Attack	Setting up inhumane camps by bribing local warlords is not the right way.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Support	Agree. If the asylum seekers don't have to cross the Mediterranean to apply for it less of them will die trying and less human trafficking will take place.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Support	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Support	Good idea. These camps can be managed by the UN. The EU can send illegal immigrants to these camps. So they will not be on EU soil. From the camps they still can apply for asylum.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Support	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop, With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today.	We should consider Russian interests in the EU policy.

__label__Support	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__Support	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability. It only requires a person's higher capacity to be compassionate, respectful and most of all dedicated to our environment's needs. Who wouldn't want such qualities to become our society's norm?	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__Support	Even if you believe you are unable to follow a plant-based lifestyle you must appreciate the effectiveness and dedication to the environment of those individuals who do.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__Support	There is no reason other than egotism to be against such a proposal.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources

__label__Support	Today we live in a system where our public healthcare system is organized on a for-profit healthcare system, where we develop knowledge through taxpayer institutions and then let companies patent this knowledge for profit this has to change, we shouldn't let the greed of capitalists extort us, the EU should work to DISMANTLE all patents and make healthcare issues for all. The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now.	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__Attack	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease.

__label__Support	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council.

This is not a democratic way. The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election.	We should abolish the European Council
__label__Support	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.	We should abolish the European Council

__label__Support	Though our constitution guarantees equal rights to women in all aspects, the mentality of people didn’t change. There have been several cases of rapes, domestic violence, dowry, acid attacks, etc. that led to the formation of several strict laws for women's safety. In 2011, India was ranked as the fourth most dangerous country for women in the world (in 2018 India was ranked the most dangerous country for women) and worst among the G20 nations when it comes to women's security.

__label__Support	The question of economic feasibility is being raised as the project is too costly at Rs. 1.5 lakh crores.

So, by enforcing legal measures such as compulsory vaccination, we can achieve 100% vaccination. The government can help them in dealing with their fears by keeping them for a longer time in vaccination centers while having a medical team by their side.	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
__label__Support	If the world did not achieve 100% vaccination, a lot of new variants will be created. So, it is important to vaccinate all to reduce the possibility of new strains.	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
__label__Attack	Many people are not taking vaccination due to the rumors that are being spread by anti-vaxxers using social media. Taking action against these rumor creators is much better for improving the vaccination rate rather than enforcing compulsory vaccination.	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
__label__Attack	Widespread awareness campaigns involving local people can help in overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Innovative and creative advertisements can encourage people to take the vaccination. These methods will be much more effective than legal measures.	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory

__label__Attack	No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly. Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this.

__label__Support	Print media is more trustworthy because once the news is published, it cannot be modified or deleted. Whereas in digital media, we can modify or delete the contents.

__label__Attack	It is not eco-friendly, since print media requires paper that is harvested from trees.	We should subsidize print media
__label__Attack	Print media is just one-way communication. It gives information to the public, but consumers cannot share their opinions. Even though some newspapers publish readers’ mails, it is not user-friendly.	We should subsidize print media

__label__Attack	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all! Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world. Radioactive rain - cool ;-)	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__Attack	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__Support	Members should adopt measures to end unpaid Internships causes they are a form of exploitation of young people.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__Attack	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__Attack	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__Attack	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. It is only transitional. We have good conditions for sustainable green energy (solar, wind, hydro, bio-methane and their combinations).	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy

__label__Attack	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it. We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control. I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands.
__label__Attack	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands.

__label__Support	This is the only way that European values and democracies can survive the challenges ahead of us.

__label__Support	A federal republic in which all European peoples can live according to their own way of life and identity. Yes, that would help!	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation

__label__Attack	If the EU intends to survive it has to integrate less. Go back to the EEC. Instead of building a static bloc, it should increase competitiveness.	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
__label__Support	Lately, the EU has appeared weak and non-organized. For example, we have had no joint policy on how to handle the pandemic. Actions to deal with various problems often come too late.

__label__Attack	Since the EU was developed, little progress and much stagnation have been made.	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
__label__Attack	The EURO has been a disaster. It has impoverished the EU and turned the EU into a fighting Union.	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
__label__Attack	Taking unilateral decisions is sometimes important because dialogue and all the other ways did not work till now.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Attack	Bifurcation can result in better governance and more efficient administration. It can also help in tackling terrorism.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Support	This may set as a bad example for the succeeding governments. Downgrading the status of a state to union territory can be taken as a precedent. For example, If the state government is ruled by a different party from the center, and if the center wants to take control of the state, this incident can be shown as an example to do so.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Support	This step may be used by separatists to influence youngsters in acting against the Indian government.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Attack	Moreover, tourism and film shootings faced obstacles due to the militancy in J&K. Now as Ladakh is a separate union territory, it can boost its economy.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Support	Bifurcation of Jammu & Kashmir was done without consulting the people and local leaders of the state. Moreover, there was a blackout of communication channels and media, so they had no possibility of expressing their views. This sends a wrong message to the people and is against the democratic principles of India. It is also against the federal principles, which guarantees rights to states. Moreover, on the same day, Article 370 was revoked, so this may make local people feel like they have no say in the decisions that impact them.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Support	Further division of Ladakh into 2 districts – Leh and Kargil on a religious basis is facing criticism from the local people. This move could have been avoided to preserve unity.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Attack	When Jammu&Kashmir were one state, Ladakh felt alienated. Its ecological and cultural uniqueness was not given enough importance and was often neglected because the culture of Ladakh and J&K are very different. Thereby people of Ladakh are demanding bifurcation for a long time. Ladakh’s local leaders feel that their region was politically neglected by the administration at J&K. So, bifurcating is a good decision.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Support	We need to protect citizen sovereignty against bad players (be it the state, private entities, or other individuals).	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__Support	Facial recognition can and will be used against each of us by governments and corporations, based on who we are and what we look like. It will create societies of fear, anxiety, and suspicion.	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__Support	Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest, and not to be discriminated against.	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__Support	Europe should choose a common language. This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language.	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language
__label__Attack	We have made huge strides in ending sex-based discrimination in Europe. I think we can say that - but for a few details - this issue has been resolved. 'Gender' is a political concept made out of whole cloth. One is certainly free to imagine oneself to be a pink unicorn, but in the eyes of the law and society, he or she remains a man or a woman.	We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender
__label__Attack	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.	We should end illegal pushbacks!

__label__Support	Behavior and habits change slowly when a new direction is pointed out. People become less satisfied with changes the older they get. EU needs time for the goodwill of the people for permanent changes. Then a new EU foreign policy can be established.	We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world
__label__Support	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers. The EU is a necessity that is comparable with the worker's unions in the 1800 industrialization. Therefore the EU has to decide what role it wants to play in this coming world order.	We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world
__label__Support	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__Support	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__Support	If an employee receives part of his salary in the form of car and petrol, he will naturally use it more than he would otherwise, be less inclined to explore alternative ways of transport and opt for a bigger more polluting vehicle than what he really needs.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__Attack	How would you know how many cases where companies and employees rely on their cars? How would you differentiate between needs and luxury?	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees

Anonymity enables powerful identities to control the messages, and therefore the identity-seeking masses.	We should promote a culture of exchange and sharing of goods and services

Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities.

It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy.	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__noRel	Quotas are always disgusting examples of oppression and evil. I don't want anything of that, I want freedom and free choice.	There should be a federal Constitution for a European Federation
__label__noRel	The technology-enabled economy of abundance without human exploitation you can endorse it. We should not hamper automation, instead, we should rethink morals about work. Let the robots do all the bad jobs and let human beings be free to pursue a creative and meaningful life	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__noRel	Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again.	The EU leadership must enter into strong agreements with the countries where immigrants come from, in order to retain them in their countries
__label__noRel	Lately, the EU has appeared weak and non-organized. For example, we have had no joint policy on how to handle the pandemic. Actions to deal with various problems often come too late. You cannot discuss solutions for years, which requires urgent action.	The EU should focus on pragmatism
__label__noRel	Marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists!	We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the costs for EU taxpayers to handle asylum seekers are reduced.	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__noRel	Economic interests should never be at the expense of social and environmental policy. It is of utmost importance that the protection of workers’ rights and the rules we agreed upon with the Paris Agreement on climate change are at the heart of trade and investment policy. As the EU belongs to the global market, we must guarantee decent jobs that are sustainable, as well as collective, independent representation of workers in trade unions.	We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses
__label__noRel	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa. Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans.	We need to develop partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__noRel	a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network will lower plane traffic	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes
__label__noRel	To build a common European understanding and to create a European identity, we need our own common language.	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__noRel	It should be the common goal of EU diplomacy to change the workings of the UN as it is. The security council is a relict of the emerging post-WW2 order and the influence of the Cold War.	We need to develop partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__noRel	I think that people should grow, learn and move into better-paid jobs. Today there are fantastic opportunities, e.g. Artificial General Intelligence is being built, and human anti-aging and even rejuvenation therapies are being developed: these are only a few areas where the most pressing need of humanity is being met. People should move into such jobs. For the manual work - there are robots coming. We should not try to distort market forces and stop development.	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries
__label__noRel	Turkey is encroaching on EU territory, Russia is sending its army to the Ukrainian border, and what can we do? Nothing, because nobody is taking us seriously. Our threats are empty and get ignored, and our diplomacy is weak. It's time for the EU to be recognized as a strong force that can and will protect its people and its interests.	EU citizens should be allowed to direct vote for more decisions
__label__noRel	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result.	We need a better distribution of refugees.
__label__noRel	Illegal immigrants have to be returned to UN refugee camps.	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__noRel	The present international economic system and trade institutions are too much a product of the not-so-glorious colonial past. We should put more democracy, more rights for people, and more equality into the international economic order.	The EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO
__label__noRel	I think it is extremely important to upgrade our relations with the former Eastern European countries and in that way move us in the right direction. It is now they need us the most. The area around the Black Sea has enormous potential. They have a growth zone that moves from western Europe to the east and at the same time a growth zone that moves from south China to the north.	NGO boats should have an government representative on board to make sure they aren't people trafficking
__label__noRel	We need to ensure fair redistribution of refugees across Europe and ensure better integration of refugees and applicants for international protection into the workplace. More concrete and fairer European policy on economic migration, to establish legal channels for entry and to foster an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as a key tool to address the social impact of migration flows.	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__noRel	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__noRel	You are justifying the genocide of indigenous Europeans who, when asked, always reject these 'refugees'.	The EU should also guarantee territorial integrity against threats from Turkey and other Middle Eastern regional powers.
__label__noRel	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.	We should build a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network
__label__noRel	Behavior and habits change slowly when a new direction is pointed out. People become less satisfied with changes the older they get. EU needs time for the goodwill of the people for permanent changes. Then a new EU foreign policy can be established.	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__noRel	taxation seems to be the only real way to incentivize other countries less worried about climate change to work on it	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__noRel	While it is only promoted/suggested and not a mandatory, its ok.	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency
__label__noRel	In order to in parallel raise consumer awareness about which products contain microplastics, the EU should introduce a requirement for mandatory labels on packages of products containing microplastics warning consumers of the presence thereof.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__noRel	Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.	We should use available solutions to make flying more sustainable right now
__label__noRel	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years.	We should adopt an extension of the application of qualified majority voting arrangements
__label__noRel	We have millions of poor true Europeans that we can help, why help migrant who have nothing in common with us?	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__noRel	We should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.	The EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe.
__label__noRel	Discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__noRel	I find the current actions of China to be incompatible with the ideology that the EU was formed and still has to this day, we can not have a relaxed attitude towards a country that sees all the world as competitors and enemies.	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
__label__noRel	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__noRel	sustainable and animal-friendly farms grow their own feed and create an ecological cycle.	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__noRel	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity. It would turn Europe into a polarized entity much like the American system and would firmly divide the European community on every issue.	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste
__label__noRel	The procedure of Family Reunification is already causing major problems in the USA.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__noRel	It would render the meetings useless since they would only be able to express official statements and instead negotiate new ideas without pressure.	We should have all workers working in private enterprises share equity in the company they work for
__label__noRel	Without decades of basic research to build on, the development of not one but several vaccines against Covid-19 to battle the current pandemic would have been impossible.	We should be realistic wrt. migration.
__label__noRel	Paying taxes is not enough need, if you want to become a citizen with full rights you need t fully embrace the country you live in.	We should change our consumption habits
__label__noRel	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact.	We should increase the salaries of artisans
__label__noRel	It would be a better idea to abolish the European Parliament. It has become an ideological Kabuki Theatre. The Commission should be entirely under the control of the sovereign member states, of course, who remain the masters of the treaties.	There should be a new EU foreign policy.
__label__noRel	Migration is part of being human and has always happened throughout history.	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from
__label__noRel	There has to be a general awareness that the real price of throw-away products and mass-produced foods is paid in the long run and that continuing down the current path will lead to more problems than having to adjust one's consumer behavior.	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
__label__noRel	The EU Database should be made accessible for health studies and prevention in order to establish a European Basic Health care industry to overcome future pandemics.	There should be a small council of people from all over the world, and identify the problems of every country and solve them.

__label__noRel	That's a terrible idea. The government propaganda machine is already going at full steam.

Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick. Instead, they have willfully created panic. Just like your ad would.	Europe should change the world for the better for everyone.
__label__noRel	Complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism.
__label__noRel	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it. We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control. I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic.	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.
__label__noRel	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense.	We need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy.
__label__noRel	Europe needs a proper parliament including a right to initiative combined with strong involvement of social partners, e.g. through European Social Dialogue or the partnership principle in regional funds.	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country.
__label__noRel	I believe the EU should expedite the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans, to help them evolve and facilitate the reconciliation problems. As you say, Montenegro for instance is a peaceful country that has made efforts to overcome past troubles, and that too should be acknowledged.	We should improve migration policies
__label__noRel	Before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have nice conditions in the EU, we should first focus on ensuring that our own people can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.	We should establish a Russian interest including EU policy.
__label__noRel	Unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants have no right to be in the country where they are unauthorized.	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	We just need to define the values and laws of our utopia and give people the resources to join together in building it.	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles
__label__noRel	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact.	We should preserve bees and polling insects
__label__noRel	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	We should increase the salaries of artisans
__label__noRel	There is a need for a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not moved an inch since 2019. There have been attempts of making progress in adopting a common European asylum system and forming an EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while also stressing its aim to closely monitor migration routes and maintain situational awareness. This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.	We should tax heavily or refuse to import products not manufactured in the European Union that do not comply with our climate standards
__label__noRel	Esperanto should be promoted as an international lingua franca. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of cross-cultural communication, allowing high degrees of inclusion.	There should be an enlargement of the European Union.
__label__noRel	How would the candidates be selected? One per country? That just makes it a tight race between the two countries with the largest population (assuming one vote per person).

__label__noRel	Retirement is often funded by taxes and taxes are decided by each member state. So each member state should also be the one who decides how those taxes are spent. For some countries, a retirement age of 65 may be unaffordable or undesirable, while for others it may not.	There should be a president for the EU elected by the people.
__label__noRel	Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.	We need a better EU migration policy
__label__noRel	The broadcasting license on the European level can help avoid misinformation, meddling, and foreign influence more than smaller networks, which would ensure a better quality of the content.	The EU should have open borders with poor countries
__label__noRel	Fear of the unknown is normal behavior. It has saved our race since ages starting when mankind was a simple monkey among others.	The EU needs a single market for news
__label__noRel	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__noRel	We should embrace and protect our culture which stands at the basis of our successful society. We also should watch out for some Europhiles in Brussels who think our culture should be replaced by multi-culturalism because it fits the EU plans better.	We need a better migration policy.
__label__noRel	Europeans should retain control of our homeland, just as everyone else should theirs.	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__noRel	Economies within a short distance, decentralization, and localization can be efficient tools for protecting the climate and the environment. Less transportation, consumption of local resources, and a high level of self-reliance in the energy and food sector lead to lower carbon footprints.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__noRel	We must support countries that want to improve the welfare and rights of their citizens. If a country wants to join the EU and meets the conditions for joining, the decision to join is solely between the candidate country and the EU.	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries
__label__noRel	Yes, but the problem is: Just because a product can be recycled, it does not mean that it always will be recycled. Let's assume that there would be a really climate friendly way to recycle batteries. Still people could throw those into landfills. How does the score deal with this?	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	Quotas are always disgusting examples of oppression and evil. I don't want anything of that, I want freedom and free choice.	We should protect 20% of land in each European country to restore biodiversity
__label__noRel	Makes sense to me, its easy to learn and doesn't come with any nationalist baggage.	There is a lack of unity in European migration policies.
__label__noRel	Instead we need to change our behavior, reduce our consumerism and decrease our overall resource use per person.	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press

__label__noRel	Will Russia also pay their share? Will Austria pay for starting WW1 or will it be Serbia? Will Poland and Hungary pay for occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia in 1938/1939? Will France pay for starting napoleonic wars? It is time to forget what happened almost 100 years ago and focus on the future and I say that as a Czech citizen whose country was occupied by Austria, Germany/Poland/Hungary and then by SSSR and all eastern satelite states.

__label__noRel	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__noRel	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat

__label__noRel	We are Europeans; this is not racism but we don't support growth.

We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.
__label__noRel	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	We should make pushbacks legal
__label__noRel	Illegal mass migration is a tragedy. Those who organize and direct mass migration are guilty of a crime against Humanity. Soros and Lukashenka are prime examples of such criminals.	We should ban wild animals in circuses

__label__noRel	We need to strengthen citizens' trust in the European project! This requires more transparency and accountability, in particular when it comes to access to documents and democratic decision-making. The 'Better Regulation' approach of the Commission which focuses on cutting costs and burdens prioritizes business interests over general interests and should be abandoned. The European project needs to benefit the many and not the few!	Europe is getting older and should be open to more migration from Asia, and southeast Asia.
__label__noRel	Knowledge of the host country's language is essential for integration. When migrants understand the local language, studies show that their values tend towards those of the host countries over time.	There should be a European Army.
__label__noRel	Psychedelic medicines specifically have the potential to radically transform our mental health care.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__noRel	Raising prices in the energy sector cannot be the solution in the fight against climate change. The European Commission allows international firms to increase their prices, and as a result, household costs are rising at an incredible rate. The EU should definitely revoke these decisions, and instead of placing the burden on its own citizens, it should instead support them to lead a more sustainable way of life. The green transition should not be a heavy burden borne on the average citizen’s shoulders	The EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO
__label__noRel	The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.	We should use available solutions to make flying more sustainable right now
__label__noRel	It's also important to remember that many people use these psychedelic medicines in the context of their own religious/spiritual practice, and therefore our draconic laws directly violate freedom of religion (and sovereignty over our own bodies). There's no way the EU should tolerate this if they really care about human rights.	There should be a president for the EU elected by the people.
__label__noRel	We have already English as a language of exchange.	The EU should implement a common pension fund

__label__noRel	Migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?	There should be a common EU migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas. If these young people create for example remote learning opportunities for African students, we should not only sponsor such projects but make exchange possible for young people in Europe to create similar items for example to foster MINT skills throughout Europe. Give more opportunities for young people from both sides to meet, exchange, and ventilate new ideas.	We should end illegal pushbacks!
__label__noRel	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU

__label__noRel	Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden's Stockholm has become the Rape Capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has skyrocketed as well in that country. France is bordering on civil war, whole territories are not under state control anymore. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We need to put our European peoples first, much like the entire world is doing while our civilization is committing suicide based on values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists.	The EU needs s common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__noRel	I think forcing people to eat a limited amount of meat is totally the wrong way because of the following reasons: 1. It would cause so much more bureaucracy 2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat? 3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.	We need an integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	We are all one and the same on this tiny wet space rock. We need to come together if we want to survive.	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU

__label__noRel	This will add to the transparency and fair competition. Insincere employers shouldn't have an advantage, and in essence, it would be beneficial for all EU members, not just the workers.	We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	We need to realize the truth of what's out there. Truthful and open research without bias or stigmas.	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__noRel	Without the refugee deal, the migrants will return to invade us.	The 9th of May (Europe Day) should be a national holiday
__label__noRel	Family Reunification creates unbearable levels of migration and acute problems of integration for several EU Member States.	The European Union should hold a referendum to decide on immigration
__label__noRel	Today we live in a system where our public healthcare system is organized on a for-profit healthcare system, where we develop knowledge through taxpayer institutions and then let companies patent this knowledge for profit this has to change, we shouldn't let the greed of capitalists extort us, the EU should work to DISMANTLE all patents and make healthcare issues for all. The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now.	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries
__label__noRel	The EU should acknowledge the fact that increasing birth rates in Europe, and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most appropriate long-term solution.	The EU needs s common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__noRel	That's a terrible idea. The government propaganda machine is already going at full steam. Do you have any idea what the psychological impact of these kinds of messages is when you blast them at people all day every day for over a year? Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick. Instead, they have willfully created panic. Just like your ad would.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__noRel	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__noRel	Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.	We need a better EU migration policy.
__label__noRel	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
__label__noRel	English is ideal as it is spoken internationally as the language of commerce, travel, and political exchange. Esperanto isn't.	Doctors should be paid based on how many people they successfully treated
__label__noRel	Directly electing the president of the commission makes the most susceptible to political sway, which would kill the commission as a body of technical experts.	We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines
__label__noRel	We certainly need levels of government at the global, regional, and local levels. Equally, we absolutely need democracy at the global, regional, and local levels. Neither the European nor the national and regional parliaments should be abolished because of the need for global governance for the planet.	We should stop buying Russian gas
__label__noRel	Transparency is the first key to real democracy. Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings. Or think about all the meetings between diplomats (Coreper) and civil servants (working groups and committees), where ±90% of decisions are made, for the Council to be rubberstamped. Meetings that most citizens don't even know about.	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU
__label__noRel	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.	European citizens want quality of life and are not interested in world supremacy
__label__noRel	Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden's Stockholm has become the Rape Capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has skyrocketed as well in that country. France is bordering on civil war, whole territories are not under state control anymore. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We need to put our European peoples first, much like the entire world is doing while our civilization is committing suicide based on values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists.	We should adopt a single migration policy.

__label__noRel	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.	Coronavirus protection should be advertised on TV and social media
__label__noRel	it is essential that environmental concerns and sustainability are the foundation of any treaty with our European Union!	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles
__label__noRel	Living in Europe is not a human right.

We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.
__label__noRel	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people.	Pay-as-you-go public health insurance funds should only be used for the most serious illnesses
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, the values and rights are interpreted and exercised differently in the states of the European Union. Whether we are speaking about minority protection, language rights, or cultural values. We can see every day that the EU is constantly retaliating against the Hungarians in Transylvania, when, despite the legislation in force, it ignores the lawlessness and atrocities committed against the Hungarians as a native minority. Furthermore, the European Union should give priority to all situations in which Hungarians in Transylvania are victims of discrimination.	The EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states
__label__noRel	Turkey is an enemy. It uses this deal to make a threat. Stop it now and send patrols to the Greek border or welcome them.	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform
__label__noRel	What is edible, should be given to humans. What humans cannot eat, should be available for animals. What both cannot use, should go to biogas plants. The solid waste from biogas plants can be transformed into excellent compost. Runoff from biogas plants can be treated & provide H2. And the heat from biogas plants can provide heating or other forms of energy.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
__label__noRel	European political parties should be independent of national parties. There should be primaries open for the citizens to choose the candidate, it would increase citizen participation and involvement in EU politics.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__noRel	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.	The European Union, as a Union of values, should limit its support to countries that do not want to adhere to European values and violate the rights of their citizens
__label__noRel	The EU should not get involved in trying to ”spread democracy” with threats and punishments, leave that to the US.	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__noRel	Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the greatest existential threat to the EU. Even more so than the CO2 threat.	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.	The EU should focus on pragmatism
__label__noRel	The human rights-based approach should be the core principle. Legal channels for entry and fostering an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as key tools to address the social impact of migration flows are necessary.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__noRel	It is unacceptable. Every nation has the right to organize its own prosecution system and no foreign prosecutor should be allowed to operate in independent states, it is a threat to the sovereignty of the member states.	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__noRel	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should also be dragged in front of the court for not taking the illegals to the closest safe port. In 90% of the cases, the closest port lies in Africa.	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency

__label__noRel	The European Parliament has developed avenues for a common foreign and defense policy and should exercise its role this way. Also, there are prerogatives of a parliament to guide and control the external policies of the EU.	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector
__label__noRel	Exported trash is often flushed to the sea by rain, thus polluting rivers on the go.	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__noRel	The intention of helping a country with democratization can easily be used to justify violent actions.	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate
__label__noRel	We need one single president of the Commission that will chair the Commission and the Council. I wonder though how the president of the EU Parliament would be involved in this structure.	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	In other words, EU (taxpayer)-sponsored propaganda.	We should put a higher tax or a toll on imported meat from abroad.
__label__noRel	We live in the XXI century. We do not want any repression of peripheries by their state center. Within the European Union, we should welcome the blessing of decentralism and localism, including the self-determination of stateless peoples and stronger autonomies within confederal agreements.

__label__noRel	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people. It is embedded in the core principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but those high and lofty principles must become a reality for all workers, old and young!	We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians
__label__noRel	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity. It would turn Europe into a polarized entity much like the American system and would firmly divide the European community on every issue.	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	Civic technologies can support the co-creation, co-production, and co-management of public services with citizens and the development of the urban commoning approach.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__noRel	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
__label__noRel	I wholeheartedly agree. Securing our neighbors and allies has to be a priority. The only thing that causes me some dismay is Turkey being a part of NATO. It was a good idea in 1951 but clearly, Turkey must be out off the map now.	EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen”
__label__noRel	With the ongoing population explosion, in particular in Africa and the ME, the EU has no other option than a total ban on immigration. Exceptions can be made for temporary stays and for experts the EU needs.	We should limit the use of fireworks
__label__noRel	The EU needs a humane, civilized, and legal way to manage migration, whether it is for economic reasons or to seek international protection.	The EU should enforce minority protection
__label__noRel	Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature. Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose. Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).	We need to develop a partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__noRel	The present international economic system and trade institutions are too much a product of the not-so-glorious colonial past. We should put more democracy, more rights for people, and more equality into the international economic order.	We should improve and modernize our energy infrastructure
__label__noRel	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border.	Intensive livestock farming should disappear
__label__noRel	Do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately. The EU does not have an actual army - not because of bureaucrats but because our member states think they are better alone than united.	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.
__label__noRel	The environmental impact of a given product should also be stated on its package and/or in menus in order to raise awareness on the subject.	We should end mass migration together.
__label__noRel	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop immigration.	The European Union should visible on the facades of the embassies and consulates of European countries.
__label__noRel	We have a deficit in democracy in the EU because of the lack of coverage of European affairs in our media. It's also the reason why people don't know much about the EU and don't understand how it benefits us all.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__noRel	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate. The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country. There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes. Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__noRel	Many countries have the view that unauthorized asylum seekers should be removed.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	EU leaders continue their naive policy of hosting millions of migrants from Muslim countries without taking into consideration the inability to integrate into society even after many generations, and the fact that the Muslim diaspora is controlled by their countries of origin, the most flagrant example is the interference of Turkey and its dictator Erdogan in the German elections calling the Turkish diaspora to boycott this election since none of the candidates please him.	We should create a European Wealth Fund
__label__noRel	Having to replace an entire mobile phone (or tablet, camera, notebook, etc.) because a battery reached the end of its useful life is infuriating. It is not just a strain on consumers' wallets, it is also devastating for the environment, as the energy and resources going into manufacture of electronics is artificially increased through the short lifespans these devices have.	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.
__label__noRel	Europe must lead the way when it comes to integrating people with Down syndrome	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe

We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses
__label__noRel	I don't really agree with that. Europe is not China and is not the USA. We don't need a strong army because Europeans don't plan to make war, our strength is to find common ground and bring peace to the world with diplomacy and intelligence.	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products
__label__noRel	Having all workers working in private enterprise, irrespective of size, share equity in the company they work for by default would motivate higher worker dedication, overall operating and productive efficiencies, improved quality, profit sharing, reduced corrupt practices in management through stricter accountability, work satisfaction - a win-win situation for all.	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU

__label__noRel	A technology that takes 20 - 40 years to build up on any meaningful scale, and takes many decades to pay its costs, if ever?	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration to EU from non-European or non-first-world countries will lead to an even more competitive advantage for the USA and other countries as our population is shrinking rapidly.	United in diversity should be a concept for reconciliation in the Western Balkans.
__label__noRel	It's also important to remember that many people use these psychedelic medicines in the context of their own religious/spiritual practice, and therefore our draconic laws directly violate freedom of religion (and sovereignty over our own bodies). There's no way the EU should tolerate this if they really care about human rights.	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__noRel	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us.	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing
__label__noRel	The idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy.	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__noRel	Economies within a short distance, decentralization, and localization can be efficient tools for protecting the climate and the environment. Less transportation, consumption of local resources, and a high level of self-reliance in the energy and food sector lead to lower carbon footprints.	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector
__label__noRel	I'd like to see inclusive legislation which considers all sorts of social businesses, gives them good protection and possibilities to develop. We need a EU social business lab to help develop, foster and research social businesses.	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law
__label__noRel	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU. EU does not equal to Europe
__label__noRel	Europe is full and cannot accept more illegal migrants. Those persons must be sent back and have to ask for approval from their state of origin.	The EU should also guarantee territorial integrity against threats from Turkey and other Middle Eastern regional powers.
__label__noRel	Migration has totally gotten out of control. The EU refuses to see the magnitude of it. Hundreds of millions like to migrate. All people without the right language and fitting education. The massive numbers of immigrants threaten the existence of EU societies, through crime, poverty, and housing shortage.

__label__noRel	The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter. The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality.	We should reduce animal farming.
__label__noRel	I find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice. Just as I can move myself, my family, furniture, car, and bank accounts freely within the EU, I should have the same right to move and merge my pensions into a single unit.	The EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it

__label__noRel	washing machines without proper filters are a major source of microplastic.	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__noRel	Agreed. Only if we show that criminals don't have a place in the EU, we can convince our citizens that refugees aren't that much of a threat.

__label__noRel	All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference.

Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time.

Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.

__label__noRel	First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.
__label__noRel	The shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens.

__label__noRel	Expansion by many dissimilar members and in particular the implementation of the EURO has made the EU unmanageable. The EURO is too strong for the less competitive members and is therefore unsustainable.	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__noRel	A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations, and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide.	We should adopt a single migration policy.

__label__noRel	An EU army independent from NATO and its US commanders is critical to strategic autonomy and avoiding being dragged into destructive US wars in the Middle East like in the past.	The EU should have common taxation and social policy
__label__noRel	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.	The EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it
__label__noRel	wind and solar power sources are inherently non-controllable and destroy our landscapes and natural environment, with their multiple harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects.	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union
__label__noRel	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__noRel	I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
__label__noRel	Things that are supposed to serve us for a long time, like a vehicle or telecommunication device or household implements should be designed to last half a lifetime under normal use.

The EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe.
__label__noRel	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity.

__label__noRel	The standardized retirement age would not only be fairer in an open market, but it would also (and even more so in the future) prevent any complexities with being paid their retirement for those who have made their contributions in different Member States throughout their lives. Even though there is to be at least a central system for this (a step in the right direction), one will only receive a share of one's retirement from a particular Member State once one reaches the retirement age of that Member State.	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately

Today there are fantastic opportunities, e.g. Artificial General Intelligence is being built, and human anti-aging and even rejuvenation therapies are being developed: these are only a few areas where the most pressing need of humanity is being met.

__label__noRel	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights.	There should be an enlargement of the European Union.
__label__noRel	The integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about. Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development? They are as much Europeans as we are.	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__noRel	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU. Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate

__label__noRel	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.' The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.	There should be a new EU foreign policy.
__label__noRel	First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world

__label__noRel	During the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states. Gathering the strength of the 27 member states in research and health could be a real asset for the EU and its citizens, but also for its influence overseas and its independence.	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.
__label__noRel	We do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices.

The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency
__label__noRel	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.

__label__noRel	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	We should stop buying Russian gas
__label__noRel	the solution must be a combination of EU regulation of microplastics, producers proactively replacing microplastics with natural elements with the same functions, and consumers making more informed choices to reduce demand from products with microplastics.

__label__noRel	Esperanto should be promoted as an international lingua franca. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of cross-cultural communication, allowing high degrees of inclusion.	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters

__label__noRel	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
__label__noRel	Europeans must embrace true values that enhance life and standards of living. Anything related to drugs, in whatever form, degenerates humanity. Soon enough we will be legalizing 'theft' in an effort to improve GDP and growth, as European colonialists have done in Africa and Asia where oppression and exploitation ruled.	We should further develop robotization
__label__noRel	The only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans.

__label__noRel	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.	United in diversity should be a concept for reconciliation in the Western Balkans.
__label__noRel	European political parties should be independent of national parties.

We also want nothing to do with 'intersectionality' which is a neo-Marxist concept of overlapping oppressions. No one is being oppressed in Europe.	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!	The EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom

__label__noRel	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress.

__label__noRel	In France, political repression fueled by rightwing ideology and ignorance led cities like Marseille to develop rampant crime that fed on the lucrative market of cannabis. Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing.	We should protect very large natural areas
__label__noRel	I understand your point and its importance, but as long as I have fangs in my mouth I will want to eat meat (like most people). You'd be better off suggesting more research into food printers.	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes
__label__noRel	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration.	The EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation
__label__noRel	More illegal and legal migration will lead to more unemployment, lower wages, more insecurity, and less sustainable social systems.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__noRel	All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified. Refugees/migrants are not to be expelled, certainly not immediately, but to be included in the employment problems and economic situation.	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__noRel	Stopping immigration as an excuse to not adopt proper anticonsumerist and industry-regulating policies will not solve anything for the environment and will only increase interethnic and interracial tensions.	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration.
__label__noRel	Changes in management practices, and above all the integration of trees in arable and pastoral lands, are key, and could turn agriculture from a net emitter to a net absorber of greenhouse gases.	United in diversity should be a concept for reconciliation in the Western Balkans.
__label__noRel	This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law
__label__noRel	Having cycling and micromobility as primary modes also makes cities quieter, less congested, less polluted, safer, and simply more pleasant and liveable, particularly for children.	There should be 6 concrete proposals for migrants on the Balkan route.
__label__noRel	There are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.	The EU needs s common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__noRel	Why do we even let in migrants who do not speak the language of the country where they wish to reside? Migration is bad for the nations and degrading for the migrants. We must work to end mass migration.	We need a plan for receiving asylum/migrants.
__label__noRel	The internet has provided unprecedented opportunities to express and comment on almost anything. But this also brings with it responsibility. Where is the boundary between freedom of expression and speech hate speech, which is no longer tolerated by the law? How can we oppose such acts – such as insults, vulgarism, or threats on social networks? Or can everyone say anything on the internet?	Catalan should be an official language of the European Parliament
__label__noRel	Migrants have a complete lack of critical thinking.	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy
__label__noRel	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.	We need to develop partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__noRel	Natural materials have a large carbon footprint. They require fresh water and land, contributing to the pressure on nature and resources around the world.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__noRel	Renewable energies should be our focus of action, especially how to improve the storage and transport of this energy precisely in order to be able to supply the countries that have the worst conditions to implement them.	EU countries should slightly reduce health insurance contributions for all citizens who do not use tobacco products
__label__noRel	People are migrating from poorer countries with difficult local climates because the nations of Europe made those countries poor and destroyed the climate.	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed
__label__noRel	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive.	We should restrict immigration.
__label__noRel	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas. If these young people create for example remote learning opportunities for African students, we should not only sponsor such projects but make exchange possible for young people in Europe to create similar items for example to foster MINT skills throughout Europe. Give more opportunities for young people from both sides to meet, exchange, and ventilate new ideas.	There should be no illegal migration.
__label__noRel	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__noRel	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.	Climate neutrality can be achieved only by nuclear energy
__label__noRel	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.	We should create a pan-European train company
__label__noRel	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries
__label__noRel	Direct democracy is too open to manipulation by populists and malefactors via social media. A transparent representative democracy with a solid lid on lobbyism is to be preferred.	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries
__label__noRel	You are justifying the genocide of indigenous Europeans who, when asked, always reject these 'refugees'.	Every human has the right to receive reliable information about the movement and distribution of public funds
__label__noRel	At this stage it is not worth investing money in current nuclear technology, what we should be doing is investing more in research into nuclear fusion energy, which is really the clean and safe energy we need and which we are getting closer and closer to achieving, in order to have those artificial suns working as soon as possible.	We should prevent the surveillance state
__label__noRel	Only if Europe has an energy partnership with Africa Europe will be able to produce enough clean energy. The EU should develop fair cooperation with the African Union and also offer Africa an alternative to the geopolitical attempts of other powers to establish themselves as global hegemons.	European Union should help young people to train in refugee countries
__label__noRel	I am ashamed that I am European right now. We are keeping refugees behind walls and on islands like savages. They don't want to run from their home country. Who are we ok to deny them the right to exist?	There should be 6 concrete proposals for migrants on the Balkan route.
__label__noRel	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them. We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__noRel	The undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.	We need a better EU migration policy
__label__noRel	Migrants have a complete lack of critical thinking.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__noRel	If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, e.g. in France where English is being thought in French. language.	The European Union should hold a referendum to decide on immigration
__label__noRel	Massive cuts to the research budget are leading to a tremendous brain drain and are destroying Europe as the home of scientific excellence.	Migration should not be the solution.
__label__noRel	The bicycle should be the main mode of transport for a majority of citizens because it is faster, it is easier, it is healthier, it is cheaper, it is more convenient, and it is eco-friendly.	The European Union should visible on the facades of the embassies and consulates of European countries.
__label__noRel	The EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life. To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration
__label__noRel	Such a hub could also have a bridging role between local necessities and opportunities at the EU level, such as project funding.	The EU should ensure a free, independent, and functioning judiciary in its Member States
__label__noRel	Give those who want to come a fair & secure possibility to do so & send those back who really damage your society. Give training, support, opportunities. My guess is that most will pay back with their contributions.	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy
__label__noRel	Migrants depend on other countries' social systems.	We should take polyester and other toxic substances out of clothing and place them with natural materials
__label__noRel	The money from this could be allocated to pan-European projects, new citizen services, etc, tangible and prestigious results that may prompt others to join in.	We should improve and modernize our energy infrastructure
__label__noRel	The shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens. And it is not in line with the fundamental rights the EU is supposed to put into practice.	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__noRel	This would help to plan the most efficient and economical itinerary	We need an integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people.	The EU needs a single market for news
__label__noRel	The proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles
__label__noRel	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain
__label__noRel	All this lengthens the life cycle of a product and reduces waste.	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.
__label__noRel	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.	There is a lack of unity in European migration policies.
__label__noRel	The money from this could be allocated to pan-European projects, new citizen services, etc, tangible and prestigious results that may prompt others to join in.	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
__label__noRel	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people
__label__noRel	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely.	There should be an EU citizenship
__label__noRel	Ukraine is infamous for its black market for weapons. Helping Ukraine by dumping weapons into such a country is folly.	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU
__label__noRel	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to integrate people with different backgrounds within the institutions.	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good
__label__noRel	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	It is important to see immigrants as people who have a culture, a religious perspective, and a very different but respectable idea of sociality compared to the European one. That's why we must act in a coordinated and careful manner between institutions and organizations.	The EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation
__label__noRel	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially article 14, states: 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.'	We should change our consumption habits
__label__noRel	It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.	We should not subsidize large agricultural groups
__label__noRel	The key to successful immigration depends upon the possibility of employment. So EU members are to decide whom they want to admit.	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries
__label__noRel	When you see young Ukrainians dying for the EU and its values during Euromaidan, you have no choice but to accept that Ukraine has chosen Europe. If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. We must deepen our relations with Ukraine and prepare to make it a candidate for membership. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia.	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__noRel	Things that are supposed to serve us for a long time, like a vehicle or telecommunication device or household implements should be designed to last half a lifetime under normal use. The quality of the building material should matter more in that instance, so less focus on recycling.	We should have all workers working in private enterprises share equity in the company they work for
__label__noRel	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
__label__noRel	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.	We should remove illegal immigrants.
__label__noRel	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__noRel	Japan was a global superpower once just behind the USA, however, it has a strict immigration policy. Where is it now in global power rankings?	The federal features of the European Treaties need to be strengthened.
__label__noRel	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU	We need to invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.	Europe should have stronger borders
__label__noRel	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.
__label__noRel	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__noRel	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.	We should be aware of migration due to climate change
__label__noRel	Migrants have a complete lack of critical thinking.	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	We need one single president of the Commission that will chair the Commission and the Council. I wonder though how the president of the EU Parliament would be involved in this structure.	We should invest in R&D
__label__noRel	Both, a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism are overdue.	There should be a better post-Brexit European Alliance
__label__noRel	In a democracy, people have the right to decide on any issue that affects their lives. If more than half of the inhabitants of a region want to form an independent state, they have the right to do so. Going against it is going against the will of the majority of citizens, and therefore, against the very essence of democracy.	We should end animal abuse
__label__noRel	Bees and pollination are essential for the sexual reproduction of plants and are an important factor in biodiversity.	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy
__label__noRel	If we tried to fix the issue by controlling the population, countries like Denmark would need to reduce their population to 1/5 of the current number, to reach sustainable resource use.	The EU needs human security approach to ensure peace.
__label__noRel	All refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left.	Esperanto should be the common language for the European Union.
__label__noRel	The EU is not responsible for the entire World.	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries
__label__noRel	I highly support this. As Jonathan Foer puts it in his book 'We are the weather': Changing our diet will not suffice to save the planet, but we won't save it unless we eat differently.	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms
__label__noRel	The EU is established on treaties, but treaties have no soul. Only a constitution has a soul, provided it is well designed: from, by, and for the people.	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	The range of primary care services should be available to all patients universally, with special emphasis on those at the margins, often in most need.	We should protect the European border
__label__noRel	Capitalism and the free market indeed created western wealth. However, the interesting question then is: who benefited from this wealth? Without some sort of regulation and control from the State, companies will continue what they do best, increase profit without any concern for environmental and social matters.	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__noRel	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	We should protect very large natural areas
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the security risks for asylum seekers are greatly reduced.	We need legal ways of migration.
__label__noRel	The EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off.	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East.
__label__noRel	The attempt to shove the postmodern version of liberalism down Europeans' throats has contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU.	The EU should start accession negotiations with Russia
__label__noRel	I agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing
__label__noRel	It is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union
__label__noRel	Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!	There should be a European Army.
__label__noRel	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values. They bring crime, terror, and chaos. And after all, if there are no more Europeans in Europe, then what will happen to our beloved continent?	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__noRel	In the EU labor market we will need more workers from outside Europe to continue the level of economic activities we are planning.	The EU should have common taxation and social policy
__label__noRel	Marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists!	People from radical Muslim countries should be banned from entering the EU countries
__label__noRel	such an approach to be successful must be implemented in each EU country to have visible results and help change the habits of both EU citizens and the private sector. And it has to be long-term promoted and funded. Can we do it?	International cooperation with third countries in the field of migration should be developed
__label__noRel	It is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	Alternative medicine should be more accepted
__label__noRel	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__noRel	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa. Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans.	We need see nuclear energy as green energy
__label__noRel	That's a terrible idea. The government propaganda machine is already going at full steam. Do you have any idea what the psychological impact of these kinds of messages is when you blast them at people all day every day for over a year? Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick. Instead, they have willfully created panic. Just like your ad would.	People from radical Muslim countries should be banned from entering the EU countries
__label__noRel	Both, a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism are overdue.	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	Europeans must embrace true values that enhance life and standards of living. Anything related to drugs, in whatever form, degenerates humanity. Soon enough we will be legalizing 'theft' in an effort to improve GDP and growth, as European colonialists have done in Africa and Asia where oppression and exploitation ruled.	We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the costs for EU taxpayers to handle asylum seekers are reduced.	We should fight racism in the EU
__label__noRel	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness
__label__noRel	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially article 14, states: 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.'	We should implement a climate score for products
__label__noRel	We are still living in a capitalism, so, the price will decide and the price of nuclear energy is the only energy price which is increasing steadily, while renewables become cheaper every year. Nuclear was always only subsidiesed by governments and never really standing on their own. The building process is slow, the price is high, no way, this could be a gain - if it weren't for the military.	We should protect bird habitats in built environments
__label__noRel	In France, political repression fueled by rightwing ideology and ignorance led cities like Marseille to develop rampant crime that fed on the lucrative market of cannabis. Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing.	We should make living wages a human right
__label__noRel	I believe the EU should expedite the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans, to help them evolve and facilitate the reconciliation problems. As you say, Montenegro for instance is a peaceful country that has made efforts to overcome past troubles, and that too should be acknowledged.	Voting for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory
__label__noRel	Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.	The EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation
__label__noRel	National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success. We need to be united, aligned, and, above all, independent from any extra-EU hegemon!	Gas and nuclear power should be supported with money from European countries
__label__noRel	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments.	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans
__label__noRel	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals. It would be good for every person to be given psychotherapeutic advice once a year in order to be able to diagnose and treat mental disorders and illnesses at an early stage or even to prevent them.	Catalan should be an official language of the European Parliament
__label__noRel	Please consider this: right now in Africa several million people are half starved, and eat a meal a day at best. They live thanks to cheap agricultural products coming from Europe, because local stuff is too expensive for them.	There should be better EU relations with Russia
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, vaccination has shown that it is unable to curb the contagion and therefore the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the EU COVID digital certificate is not able to guarantee the safety for which it was designed, demonstrating that it is primarily a tool of discrimination without real usefulness in containing contagion	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__noRel	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.
__label__noRel	Refugees want to find a safe place in order to live. People are HUMAN.	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism
__label__noRel	We have millions of poor true Europeans that we can help, why help migrant who have nothing in common with us?	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency
__label__noRel	Catalonia must become independent from the Spanish dictatorial repression that tries to end the Catalan language and culture.	We should include limited profitability enterprises in the EU treaties
__label__noRel	The EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life. To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency
__label__noRel	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers. The EU is a necessity that is comparable with the worker's unions in the 1800 industrialization. Therefore the EU has to decide what role it wants to play in this coming world order.	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
__label__noRel	This is especially true when we know how much alcohol is damaging the brain, in particular in the developing brain of teenagers. Also unlike cannabis, over-consumption of alcohol leads to death so I would say that this product is much more dangerous. Yet unlike cannabis, alcohol is legal.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them. We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.	The EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom
__label__noRel	During the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states. Gathering the strength of the 27 member states in research and health could be a real asset for the EU and its citizens, but also for its influence overseas and its independence.	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism
__label__noRel	The EU should continue its enlargement to the Western Balkans to further its own interests, and to bring stability and prosperity to the region. Serbia should have joined long ago.	We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses
__label__noRel	In the UK since 2015, there were over 80 PV-related fires, at least 1/4 of which were actually solar panels catching fire, releasing toxic smoke, and contaminating the ground with cadmium.	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__noRel	I recently read that especially African families tend to send their smartest, best educated youngsters abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their home countries and for our future. We need skilled & educated people in many sectors, but sends such people back to their home countries, because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees.	There should be a European Common Defence and Security Alliance
__label__noRel	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity. It would turn Europe into a polarized entity much like the American system and would firmly divide the European community on every issue.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
__label__noRel	If we continue investing in climate and environmentally damaging, regressive, and immensely expensive nuclear power plants or technologies is a mockery of the world and a waste of money and time that we can use for sustainable investments and transformations.	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__noRel	most of the electric power is produced by thermal power plants that burn oil derivatives and by the nuclear industry. So, until the electric power generation won't be mostly by renewable energies, is basically irrelevant which kind of cars are we using.	We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender
__label__noRel	No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget. And until the democratic deficit and other systemic problems in the EU are fixed, it's good that the budget is kept at 1-2% of the total EU GDP.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__noRel	We pay taxes and we have the right to see where our money goes. It’s very easy to implement through an online platform same as digital banking, but for the state. This will stamp out corruption and thereby free up a huge amount of money that we can spend on the needs of the population.	There should be no illegal migration
__label__noRel	The demographic problems for the EU, which are real, must be solved by encouraging child-bearing and a generous family policy, not through migration. We must celebrate motherhood and Moms. We must realize that raising a child involves serious costs in today's Europe.	We should sponsor the general population for taking in migrants
__label__noRel	Limiting freedom of movement does not seem like a good idea to me. I think what you are experiencing is bad local management, with urban planning laws fast growth and traffic issues can be fixed and avoided altogether.	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__noRel	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell.	We should ban domestic air traffic
__label__noRel	In a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.	Solar and wind energies have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects

__label__noRel	Economic interests should never be at the expense of social and environmental policy. It is of utmost importance that the protection of workers’ rights and the rules we agreed upon with the Paris Agreement on climate change are at the heart of trade and investment policy.

Anonymity enables powerful identities to control the messages, and therefore the identity-seeking masses.	The EU should ensure a free, independent, and functioning judiciary in its Member States
__label__noRel	We need single and selective migration rules.

The EU should ensure a free, independent, and functioning judiciary in its Member States
__label__noRel	To have a chance that one candidate (with a good chance to win) comes from your own country, I think people from little countries can wait 40 years.

__label__noRel	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address.

We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable
__label__noRel	Where energy costs for consumers are high in combination with renewables, it's mostly due to political decisions and market set-up, not due to technical issues. Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers.	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources
__label__noRel	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	Europe has more than enough ideological disputes within its own borders.

Countries outside the EU must deal with their own problems as best they can. Less interference from Europe is the order of the day, not more.	Europe should have stronger borders
__label__noRel	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability.

__label__noRel	Judeo-Christian values are the cornerstone of European civilization - they deserve special protection because they made us who we are today. Mass migration from people with cultures totally alien to Europe is the phenomenon that most threatens EU security and cohesion.

We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing
__label__noRel	Fishing with live bait creates the risk of introducing and spreading invasive species, as well as the risk of transmitting diseases to wild fish.	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country.
__label__noRel	The EU is also weak in dealing with NGOs and in dealing with countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrants. Indeed, the EU cannot be trusted because of a lack of ambition or lack of competence.	Europe should establish a common Army across Europe
__label__noRel	The internet has provided unprecedented opportunities to express and comment on almost anything. But this also brings with it responsibility. Where is the boundary between freedom of expression and speech hate speech, which is no longer tolerated by the law? How can we oppose such acts – such as insults, vulgarism, or threats on social networks? Or can everyone say anything on the internet?	We should have legal migration channels.
__label__noRel	If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia. In order to support them we need a European army and a common foreign policy.	There should be a common EU migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	Not taking climate impact and biodiversity loss into account makes it difficult for businesses to move towards a more virtuous system.	We should protect bird habitats in built environments
__label__noRel	I am ashamed that I am European right now. We are keeping refugees behind walls and on islands like savages. They don't want to run from their home country. Who are we ok to deny them the right to exist?	The European Union should hold a referendum to decide on immigration
__label__noRel	The organization of mass migration is a heinous crime. No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	We need a better distribution of refugees
__label__noRel	Changing the EU foreign policy voting procedure will cause serious problems.	We need a common EU TV channel free of charge for people in all Member States
__label__noRel	Europe is more than rich enough to welcome many immigrants and if they are permitted to work, they will even generate their own income and benefits for the country they arrive in.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__noRel	The EU should continue its enlargement to the Western Balkans to further its own interests, and to bring stability and prosperity to the region. Serbia should have joined long ago.	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources
__label__noRel	We must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector
__label__noRel	The present international economic system and trade institutions are too much a product of the not-so-glorious colonial past. We should put more democracy, more rights for people, and more equality into the international economic order.	We need a better distribution of refugees.
__label__noRel	This is a huge discrimination. Everyone should have the chance to develop to a personal level. Or should we all do an IQ-test to stay in our country? Because it could avoid dangerous things like rasicm.	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__noRel	No, this is a horrible idea to force people to go vegan. While I agree that we, as a society, are eating too much meat, which is bad for both the environment and our health, this will only create tension and anger towards the EU.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__noRel	There are languages that are spoken by fewer people and are official	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	I highly support this. As Jonathan Foer puts it in his book 'We are the weather': Changing our diet will not suffice to save the planet, but we won't save it unless we eat differently.	There should be a single EU policy.
__label__noRel	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.	We should invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Our Europe continent is in debt and doesn't have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to disregard our laws! We have enough poor people in Europe already and we need to take care of them!	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Having an upper limit for annual income would make our society fairer, more inclusive, and overall a better society for everybody	We need an integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!	Germany should start paying reparations share for any damaged countries of Europe up to 100 years after its attack on international society
