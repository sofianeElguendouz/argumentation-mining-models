__label__Support	Economies within a short distance, decentralization, and localization can be efficient tools for protecting the climate and the environment. Less transportation, consumption of local resources, and a high level of self-reliance in the energy and food sector lead to lower carbon footprints.	We should support short-distance economies
__label__Support	supporting short-distance economies can help kick off the development of localized small-scale economies.	We should support short-distance economies
__label__Support	What is edible, should be given to humans. What humans cannot eat, should be available for animals. What both cannot use, should go to biogas plants. The solid waste from biogas plants can be transformed into excellent compost. Runoff from biogas plants can be treated & provide H2. And the heat from biogas plants can provide heating or other forms of energy.	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain

__label__Support	In order to be able to fight cross-border crime, Europol should have the same jurisdiction as the FBI in the US. It should focus on domestic EU cross-border crime fighting. It should have the autonomy to act without the intervention of local or national political influence.	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI
__label__Attack	I think Europol should stay an association of regular National Police Departments and not be turned into anything else. However, I do support the creation of a European Criminal Investigations Office that will have full jurisdiction in the EU to investigate kidnappings and missing persons, cross-border and organized crime, terrorism threats, and digital crimes, and apprehend fugitives and suspects.	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI
__label__Attack	Fossil-sourced natural gas is as harmful as coal or oil. If it is sourced from fossil fuels, natural gas produces a net increase in CO2 in the atmosphere when burned.	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__Attack	Some biofuels, such as soy, corn, sugar cane, rapeseed, and palm oil encourage deforestation	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__Support	Refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course. When it comes to crimes, people are simply no longer worthy of protection and cannot be expelled because their actions show us that they neither accept nor respect our rules.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__Attack	All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified. Refugees/migrants are not to be expelled, certainly not immediately, but to be included in the employment problems and economic situation.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__Attack	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people. If we manage to be a welcoming continent, the people who come will thank us by being part of society.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__Support	A great idea because it definitely lowers the threshold.	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Support	It's high time that all broadcasting stations in the EU stimulate their journalists to cover European news as well.	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Support	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Support	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to integrate people with different backgrounds within the institutions.	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Support	The more language communication skills around the closer we can get in this complicated world we live in. The fact it is a popular language around the world but not really recognized in Europe should change. I fully endorse its recognition in Europe.	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__Support	Esperanto is a common language of citizens from all countries of the EU. Esperanto encounters bring them together for contact and understanding. The authorities of the European Union are called upon to support this direct communication of the citizens. It is our free choice in which language we want to talk to each other - please recognize and promote it!	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__Support	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__Support	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex).	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries
__label__Support	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries

__label__Attack	if you want to save birds, you perhaps should think about domesticated cats and making modern buildings more bird-friendly. If you want to save insects, look at the way of land use and agriculture, and create insect-friendly gardens.	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__Support	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	We should protect the European border
__label__Support	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.	We should protect the European border

__label__Attack	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__Attack	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__Support	All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__Support	If the European Council listened to the results of the inquiry made by the European Commission. 'The EU was set to stop changing its clocks in 2021, but then came Brexit, the pandemic, and some messy international bureaucracy'.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__Support	Compulsory military training can also make people stronger physically &amp; emotionally.	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India
__label__Attack	Most of the reserve force will not be utilized, which means huge amounts of expenditure on trainings will go in vain.	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India
__label__Attack	Some people do not have enough strength to participate in such intense trainings. They may seem normal from outside but may have mental illnesses. Military trainings can be emotionally and physically daunting for them. In such cases compulsory trainings will be a threat to their life.	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India
__label__Support	At present, most of the farmers in India are following chemical-based farming. But the food produced by excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can cause serious health problems when consumed. So, there is a need to address this, and Natural farming can be a solution to this.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Support	Even though organic farming produces healthy and nutritious food, it produces greenhouse gases and thereby contributes to climate change. So, the best alternative is ZBNF.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Support	With ZBNF, the government does not have to spend crores of rupees on loan waiver schemes.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Support	The third agricultural revolution, which is also called as ‘Green revolution resulted in the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Chemical-based farming results in soil health deterioration, heavy water usage for crops, and high input costs. Organic farming was started as a solution to this. But it requires large amounts of manure & vermicompost. So, organic farming is quite expensive. But the Zero-Budget Natural Farming approach will require very fewer input costs and restores soil health and produces highly nutritious food.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Attack	ZBNF is a cow-based farming practice. So ZBNF will result in an increase in the number of cows. But cows produce Methane, Nitrous Oxide & Ammonia, which are greenhouse gases and hence contribute to climate change. Methane is more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide, which is another greenhouse gas. Comparatively, methane is 25 times more powerful than Carbon dioxide. Nitrous Oxide is 300 more powerful than Carbon dioxide. And hence it is not a totally safe option.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Attack	The name – ‘Zero Budget Natural Farming’ is confusing. If anyone hears the name for the first time, he/she will think that this approach requires no investment. But it requires investment to spend on labor, cow maintenance, and water. The costs are very low when compared with other forms of agriculture, but it is not completely zero. To avoid this confusion, ZBNF was renamed as Subhash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF). But, it was announced as ZBNF in the budget 2019.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Support	We are witnessing farmer suicides in the past few years in several parts of the country. This is mainly because of the high input costs involved in farming. To raise capital, they are forced to take loans and if the crop fails due to various reasons, they are opting for suicide. Zero Budget Natural Farming will prevent farmers from getting trapped in a vicious cycle of debts.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Attack	In the 1960s, the Green revolution increased food grain production with the aim of achieving food security and preventing famines. At present India’s population is increasing. So we need an abundant food supply. This may not be possible if we completely switch to natural farming.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India

__label__Support	To help achieve this, the EU should reduce its excessive livestock subsidies. An agricultural transition away from cattle towards plants would free up a lot of space	We should protect very large natural areas
__label__Support	Very large natural areas need to be protected to promote wildlife and the return of self-sustaining and fertile biodiversity!	We should protect very large natural areas
__label__Attack	Though the markets are yet a little controlled, they are freer than before. Consumerism improved the standard of living of the common Indian middle class tremendously. In recent decades, the Indian government has been improving the markets in order to boost entrepreneurial activity.	Consumerism brings more harm than good
__label__Attack	The middle class benefited tremendously from consumerism. Increased job opportunities, wages, and cheaper goods helped raise their living standards tremendously. The new world order gave them hope that even they could have luxuries like the elite. Through business, they could climb up the social ladder.	Consumerism brings more harm than good
__label__Attack	On the economic side, consumerism had a positive impact. Due to the increase in wages, people started buying more. Due to increased demand, aided by increased supply (due to the setting up of factories) entrepreneurial activity got a boost. Businesses were set up, jobs increased, wages improved and living standards improved. Overall, the world took a turn for the better. This made everyone look at consumerism (or for them, vanity) in a different light. Instead of being a stigma, it actually became a boon.	Consumerism brings more harm than good
__label__Attack	Many people are dying of hunger in India. Hunger and malnutrition are the biggest problems India is facing right now. Beef is a cheap protein available to poor people. With the cattle slaughter ban, the malnutrition problem worsens further.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Attack	70% of the cattle in India is owned by marginal farmers. They cannot afford to maintain their cattle after the cattle stop providing benefits to farmers, like providing milk, dung, etc. The only way for farmers is to sell these old animals to slaughterhouses.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Support	The cow is a sacred animal for Hindus. Killing cows hurts their sentiments.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Attack	It is not ethical to interfere with the food habits of others.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Support	It is our responsibility to stop cruelty against animals. Article 48 of the Indian constitution mentions that the state should take steps in prohibiting the slaughter of cattle. Many slaughterhouses are still not following the rules to not harass the animals while killing. Animals are subjected to intense suffering at most slaughterhouses.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Attack	Taking action against illegal slaughterhouses is the right step, but banning entire cattle slaughter may not be the right decision by the central government. There are food security and livelihood security issues. It is the responsibility of the government to respect everyone’s choices equally.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Support	Subsidies for meat production and fishery not only have a negative impact on our environment - but they also destroy the economy in poorer countries in Africa! We really should find a way to stop these and get out of this vicious circle!	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries
__label__Attack	This can be a threat to privacy because this linking can lead to the profiling of voters. Several states collected caste, religion, and other sensitive information as part of aadhaar data collection. So, this can be misused by some politicians to selectively eliminate some voters based on their caste or any other identity.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Attack	If legitimate voters do not have an aadhaar or if they could not link it due to any reason, they will be removed from the list. For example, some homeless people do not have aadhaar cards yet. In the 2018 Telangana Assembly elections, linking aadhaar cards with Voter ID led to the elimination of 20 lakh voters.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Attack	There are fake and duplicate aadhaar cards too. So, linking aadhaar cards with voter IDs may complicate the issue.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Support	This can be used to eliminate fake voter cards. Moreover, some people have voter cards in 2 or more areas. These duplicate voter cards can be eliminated by linking Aadhaar cards with Voter IDs.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Support	This linking can clear the path to internet voting or e-voting.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Attack	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.	We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage
__label__Support	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime!	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__Support	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__Support	European institutions should take factual studies of the relative harm of different drugs into account. A UK study has shown that drugs such as cannabis and many hallucinogenic drugs are far less harmful than alcohol. The study in question was conducted by David J Nutt, Leslie A King, Lawrence D Phillips, on behalf of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__Attack	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality
__label__Attack	In the case of nuclear power, cooling is needed to prevent a meltdown. And if water is not available because of drought or freezing, earthquake or tsunami, etc, these gigantic steam engines have to be shut down, otherwise, they will produce highly hazardous outcomes.	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy
__label__Attack	If you want to do it for nuclear power, then it would be better to do it for every single kind of energy production methods. It’s also important then to include the complete cycle of all the energies, the human cost, the extraction of primary resources, in the case of renewable energy, take into account the necessary energy storage, and so on and so forth.	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__Support	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. They are internationally recognized & very precise.

The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details.	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable
__label__Support	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.

__label__Support	Currently the ETS only applies to certain carbon-emitting industries covering 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. To effectively combat climate change 40% is not enough. That is why the ETS has to be expanded to at least cover agriculture and transport as well. In Addition to the extension of the ETS the subsidies in fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) must be cut in the near future.	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)

We should not forget about indigenous Europeans

However, Brussels is causing problems by telling the whole World that everyone (7 billion people) has the right to apply for asylum in the EU.

__label__Support	Experts have been discussing that the two major threats in front of us are Climate Change and Nuclear Weapons. And they have been urging for complete disarmament. To some extent they are right. When a nuclear bomb will explode the surface will become hotter than the sun and apart from the mass destruction and deaths, the generations of people and animals who survive will perish for many decades. Reports say that almost 2000 nuclear weapons are kept on high alert throughout the year. Any misunderstanding or miscommunication can lead to a disaster, and with the impulsive leadership we are seeing around the world possibilities are higher than before. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the symbolic Doomsday Clock by 30 seconds in February, which indicates how world leaders are failing in maintaining peace.	Nuclear disarmament is necessary

__label__Attack	Nuclear weapons are extremely lethal and can wipe out life on the Earth, and have actually worked as a deterrence to full-scale wars. We have seen two world wars, and the second one came to an end with a nuclear bomb being dropped by the USA on Japan. Since then, we haven’t seen any open, full-fledged wars, not because there have been no tensions among the countries and we all are living happily, but because of the reason that most of the developed and developing countries have nuclear arms.	Nuclear disarmament is necessary
__label__Attack	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters

__label__Attack	The age of 18 years is considered a legal adult in India. They have voting rights too. But not giving them the right to marry the partner of their choice may work against their rights. In 2018, the Law Commission recommended lowering the minimum legal age of men from 21 to 18 years and suggested keeping both genders’ minimum legal age for marriage as 18 years.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Support	At present, many girls are forced to drop out of studies for marriage. So, making the minimum legal age for marriage 21 will allow them to continue their studies. Thereby, many more women will go for higher education.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Support	Teenage pregnancies increase the risk of high blood pressure, anemia, and several other health problems. It can also lead to the death of the mother due to pregnancy complications. So, raising the age of marriage for girls can reduce the chance of maternal mortality.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Support	Early marriages result in several mental health issues in many girls. So, this move can eliminate this problem.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Support	As several girls are married at 18 years, they are not having financial independence. This is resulting in dependence on their husbands for survival. The dependence will force them to stay in the relationship even if it is abusive. So, raising the minimum legal age for marriage can empower women and can help them in achieving financial independence before marriage.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Attack	As per the government data of 2017, the average age of marriage for women is increased to 22.1 years. So, the change is voluntary. The change was mainly due to the improving education among women. So, the solution lies in encouraging education for girls, conducting awareness programs on the importance of education, financial independence and the consequences of teenage pregnancies should be conducted instead of passing a law to bring a real change in society.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Attack	At present, child marriages are happening throughout India even after ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, of 2006’. As per the National Family Health Survey (2019-2021), 1/4th of the women aged 20-24 years were married before attaining the age of 18 years. After the pandemic, the number of child marriages increased significantly. So, the problem lies in the implementation. Hence the law alone cannot bring a change in society without proper implementation. Root causes should be addressed before bringing a law.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Attack	Several girls are being forced into marriages due to the patriarchal mindset of their families. Until now, many girls of such families rebelled against such forced marriages and married the person of their choice after attaining 18 years with the help of legal support. But now, they have to wait till attaining 21 years. This will be misused by patriarchal families to threaten and control them.

We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__Support	The European Parliament is in dire need of reform. It has become a circus, where the MEPs engage in wild ideological posturing without substance. The EP's function is to address the pressing needs of EU citizens, but it hasn't done that for ages. One possible solution could be to replace it with a legislative body that is made up of delegates from member state parliaments.	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making
__label__Support	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution. It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament.

__label__Support	Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are by far the most important neighbors of the EU. A good relationship with all three is very desirable for the EU. For that, we would have to be willing to understand their history better.	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Support	The Russian Federation is our neighbor. We share common historic and cultural ties with them. Today the EU confronts Russia with sanctions. An understandable reaction to its actions in Ukraine and failing democracy. Let us not forget actions done by others (US intervention in Iraq, the Chinese in Tibet and their treatment of minorities, etc.). Yet we close our eyes.	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Support	Russia is troublesome with its own agenda and unconventional methods. Perhaps due to a heritage of a system, that is no longer the norm today. Remember, they fought next to us and Russians merit our hand reaching out to them. A policy change to show empathy, foster closer economic ties, and build on bilateral projects and partnerships in various cultural, scientific, trade, or economic programs.	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Support	Including Russia in our sphere of friendship would allow the EU to discuss certain values from within and coax them toward democracy and change. Economic partnerships can act as leverage. Friendly ties, in time, will bring common views to prevail.	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Support	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent.

Society and media exposes the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in genuine cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However the same is not true with the complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt about the genuinity of the case.

Plato, Socrates, Hayek, Borovský, Auberon Herbert, Herbert Spencer, Roger Scruton, Ronald Reagan (speeches), Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson ... There are texts thousands of years old and also recent books ... you can start anywhere you wish ...	We should protect bird habitats in built environments
__label__noRel	Migrants sell drugs.	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__noRel	In a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism.
__label__noRel	Only if Europe has an energy partnership with Africa Europe will be able to produce enough clean energy. The EU should develop fair cooperation with the African Union and also offer Africa an alternative to the geopolitical attempts of other powers to establish themselves as global hegemons.	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax
__label__noRel	Why can't Arab countries shelter refugees from other Arab countries? Same habits, religion and they have enough wealth.	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable
__label__noRel	The United States is investing an average of more or less 25 million euros per year on health care research for people with Trisomy 21 while the European Union is lagging far behind with only 3 million per year. This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21.	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need.
__label__noRel	The proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	We should create a European Wealth Fund
__label__noRel	Fear of the unknown is normal behavior. It has saved our race since ages starting when mankind was a simple monkey among others.	We should develop a strategy for the EU defense in relation to NATO
__label__noRel	What we are now seeing are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over years the population will have grown to 2,0 billion. That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today. At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear. Not much of a future for the young Europeans.	We should include limited profitability enterprises in the EU treaties
__label__noRel	Yes, the European Union needs effective policies to combat online hate speech and these need to be regularly updated as technology evolves and to take into account worldwide learning on how to effectively combat online hate speech.	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__noRel	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration
__label__noRel	The EU and its member states have already various partnership or neighborhood programs for Non-EU states.	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.
__label__noRel	Public services of good quality and universal access are key to ensuring fairer, more inclusive, and equal societies. They have a clear redistributive effect and help steer development in a more sustainable direction. The Covid-19 crisis if anything helped to prove the crucial role that the public sector and public services play and must continue playing!	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society
__label__noRel	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener. In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.	We should not have illegal immigrants!
__label__noRel	Worldwide, nuclear power has prevented emissions of 240 billion tonnes of CO2 and prevented 1.8 million lives due to prevented air pollution (Kharecha, Hansen 2013).	We need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy.
__label__noRel	A green initiative that I can endorse whole-heartedly. Rational environmentalism can save both our planet and our democracy (from the menace of the radical Greens).	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	In my point of view it will be essential to impose some compensatory levies on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage.	We should support agroforestry
__label__noRel	if you want to save birds, you perhaps should think about domesticated cats and making modern buildings more bird-friendly. If you want to save insects, look at the way of land use and agriculture, and create insect-friendly gardens.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__noRel	What we are now seeing are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over years the population will have grown to 2,0 billion. That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today. At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear. Not much of a future for the young Europeans.	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries
__label__noRel	Illegal mass migration is a tragedy. Those who organize and direct mass migration are guilty of a crime against Humanity. Soros and Lukashenka are prime examples of such criminals.	We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering
__label__noRel	I don't see how stopping putting a stop to migration will suddenly impact our eco footprint in that extend. Firstly, migration is in our nature. Without migration you wouldn't be here. second, the cost of migration is self-sustained.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	It is not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognizing patterns, reasons, and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in a vacuum. If it is easier and cheaper to live not sustainably, people will do it, even if they are conscious of the consequences.	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__noRel	For sure you are technically or geographically correct, geographically Europe extends to the Ural mountains But in this forum, we initiate a common thinking on the future of Europe, which we associate with the EU. So please avoid any reference to arrogance and don't corrupt this respectful debate.	We should promote the use of nuclear energy
__label__noRel	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.	We should improve migration policies
__label__noRel	This only works if you're young and healthy, otherwise, you're a bad risk for private health insurance and it will become even more expensive	The European Union, as a Union of values, should limit its support to countries that do not want to adhere to European values and violate the rights of their citizens
__label__noRel	I think that people should grow, learn and move into better-paid jobs. Today there are fantastic opportunities, e.g. Artificial General Intelligence is being built, and human anti-aging and even rejuvenation therapies are being developed: these are only a few areas where the most pressing need of humanity is being met. People should move into such jobs. For the manual work - there are robots coming. We should not try to distort market forces and stop development.	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness
__label__noRel	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	We should end animal abuse
__label__noRel	The EU has some rules on how social security systems are coordinated (Regulation 883/2004/EC). EU rules ensure that the pension rights accrued in each country are added together and paid out by the pension insurance institution of the Member State of affiliation. But the bureaucratic nightmare is probably just as guaranteed. A better solution would be a transparent and digital platform that collects pension entitlements from all EU member states. That way, every citizen would have an overview of his or her pension entitlements at all times, not just until when they are due.	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__noRel	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.	We should promote the use of nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__noRel	I am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction. So NGOs and development cooperation must be involved. An army that can fight must also be able to build. We therefore also need a civilian army in Europe. I would also like an army consisting of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army. Please also take into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objection, also as in the German army.	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
__label__noRel	Respect for human rights and effort sharing, and solidarity should be common sense in EU member states. Unfortunately, they're not yet.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__noRel	In fact, political NGOs advocating for any cause whatsoever should be banned from schools and kindergartens.	The EU needs human security approach to ensure peace.
__label__noRel	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.
__label__noRel	The migrants that are already (legally) here should be taught western values so they and their families can integrate/assimilate, as the age-old saying goes 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'.	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax
__label__noRel	It's high time that all broadcasting stations in the EU stimulate their journalists to cover European news as well.	Permanent non-EU nationals who are living in the European Union should have more rights.
__label__noRel	If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia. In order to support them we need a European army and a common foreign policy.	Europe is getting older and should be open to more migration from Asia, and southeast Asia.
__label__noRel	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.	The EU should have open borders with poor countries
__label__noRel	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	The current differing legal cultures of the Member States need to be developed into a common legal culture in Europe
__label__noRel	Forty years of UK membership in the European Union have clearly proven that it is not a good idea to conclude agreements with England.	We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology
__label__noRel	Not taking climate impact and biodiversity loss into account makes it difficult for businesses to move towards a more virtuous system.	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU
__label__noRel	Real democracy cannot do without economic democracy. If the major decisions about our future life (investments, inventions, production) are made outside social control, then there is no real democracy. Without proper social consultation, there is no prospect for a fair Europe.	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making
__label__noRel	Pragmatism entails the protection and promotion of European interests, banning top-down ideology, and respecting the cultural and political individuality of every Member state.	We should stop subsidizing mass livestock farms
__label__noRel	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	We have already English as a language of exchange.	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__noRel	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.	There should be no illegal migration
__label__noRel	According to BBC: 'Bitcoin uses more electricity annually than the whole of Argentina'	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
__label__noRel	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to integrate people with different backgrounds within the institutions.	We should improve and modernize our energy infrastructure
__label__noRel	The environmental impact of a given product should also be stated on its package and/or in menus in order to raise awareness on the subject.	The EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it
__label__noRel	The key to successful immigration depends upon the possibility of employment. So EU members are to decide whom they want to admit.	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU
__label__noRel	No, this is a horrible idea to force people to go vegan. While I agree that we, as a society, are eating too much meat, which is bad for both the environment and our health, this will only create tension and anger towards the EU.	The EU should have open borders with poor countries
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable
__label__noRel	Integration and immigration in a host country require a lot of effort	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__noRel	Each country should keep its power, which is ensured through the current unanimous voting process in the European Union.	Europe must help Ukraine
__label__noRel	Where energy costs for consumers are high in combination with renewables, it's mostly due to political decisions and market set-up, not due to technical issues. Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers.	We should put in place policies for the protection of insects
__label__noRel	It is unacceptable. Every nation has the right to organize its own prosecution system and no foreign prosecutor should be allowed to operate in independent states, it is a threat to the sovereignty of the member states.	We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic
__label__noRel	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.	We should label products with environmental impact and climate impacts in clear language
__label__noRel	The EU is not responsible for the entire World.	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	This would strengthen the carbon sinks across Europa.	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__noRel	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.
__label__noRel	The NGOs are committing the EXACT same crime Lukashenko is guilty of: Organizing mass migration and directing it toward Europe is aggression and an act of hybrid warfare.	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__noRel	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.	We should invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Instead we should look into investing in foreign countries and help building a stable environment.	We need to develop partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__noRel	A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations, and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society
__label__noRel	This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.	The Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept.
__label__noRel	This only works if you're young and healthy, otherwise, you're a bad risk for private health insurance and it will become even more expensive	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__noRel	Europe should choose a common language. This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language.	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	The idea of a circular economy could help us to tackle the problem of overconsumption and overproduction of waste.	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare for EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	As Europe bears the burden of the XXth century authoritarian regimes (right and left) and saw their children ideologically possessed by fascist and communist governmental propaganda (Hitlerjugend (right) and Pioneer (left) movements), we need to limit the access of the children - as one of the most vulnerable groups of our community - to every political ideology and propagating associations.	We should put in place policies for the protection of insects
__label__noRel	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop the conflict.	We need a common EU TV channel free of charge for people in all Member States
__label__noRel	Behavior and habits change slowly when a new direction is pointed out. People become less satisfied with changes the older they get. EU needs time for the goodwill of the people for permanent changes. Then a new EU foreign policy can be established.	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Africa and the Middle East have the highest birthrate in the World. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1,55. It is this high birthrate that keeps them poor. There is almost nothing the EU can do about it.	We should not subsidize large agricultural groups
__label__noRel	t is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	Serbia should join the EU.
__label__noRel	A migrant, with the proper education and support, will in his turn contribute for society, which allows more people to have a fulfilling life.	We should adopt a single migration policy.
__label__noRel	According to Mrs. Ngozi Okonjat, African countries follow the example of the Asian Tigers.	We should support Frontex.
__label__noRel	There is a need for a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not moved an inch since 2019. There have been attempts of making progress in adopting a common European asylum system and forming an EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while also stressing its aim to closely monitor migration routes and maintain situational awareness. This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans
__label__noRel	Every human being has a conscience that allows them to recognize what is true and what is good, and it is by virtue of this awareness that we demand that no European Union funds be allocated to activities that destroy human embryos.	There should be a new EU foreign policy.
__label__noRel	The vast majority of the victims of this genocide in China are Muslims. And yet, the Muslim countries see the USA and the West as their arch-enemies!	We need a better migration policy.
__label__noRel	Migration is part of being human and has always happened throughout history.	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes
__label__noRel	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!	We should promote a plant-based diet
__label__noRel	Building walls is a sign of fear and weakness.	We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians
__label__noRel	Less centralization in Brussels, more flexibility.	Doctors should be paid based on how many people they successfully treated
__label__noRel	We must move towards full co-decision power for the European Parliament and the abolition of unanimity for climate, energy, social affairs, and taxation policies.	We should implement a climate score for products
__label__noRel	Europe needs a proper parliament including a right to initiative combined with strong involvement of social partners, e.g. through European Social Dialogue or the partnership principle in regional funds.	Imprisonment of foreign criminals should be carried out in their country
__label__noRel	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.	We should sponsor the general population for taking in migrants
__label__noRel	First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__noRel	We need to realize the truth of what's out there. Truthful and open research without bias or stigmas.	We need see nuclear energy as green energy
__label__noRel	Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
__label__noRel	What are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money? The religion? The food? Their political system? And then reevaluate each year? This comment is plain ignorant.	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__noRel	I agree, no one should migrate to a country if they're going to commit a crime.	The demographic decline should be stopped.
__label__noRel	There has to be better funding for research, but it should not be administered top-down. Let researchers decide rather than politicians. Do not stifle research by bureaucracy. At the time being, with large consortia getting multi-million euro grants, the application process has become too complicated for most researchers. Rather invest in reproducible, transparent, open research.	We should create a pan-European train company
__label__noRel	I am all for the creation of a European army, but for that, the question of the command of this army must also be resolved. And this is where the idea of a European Security Council is very interesting and deserves to be pushed.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__noRel	Migration is part of being human and has always happened throughout history.	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.
__label__noRel	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.).	EU citizens should be allowed to direct vote for more decisions
__label__noRel	People's feelings arent all that important. If you have had enough of the Internet, you can always find yourself a hobby.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__noRel	A European army is not only needed to attack and defend but to give weight to European words.	We should improve migration policies
__label__noRel	No Federations, no centralization. We need to respect the European diversity.	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__noRel	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU	There should be a single EU policy.
__label__noRel	Sustainable development and climate change mitigation in EU Trade deals should be examples of best practices of EU policy.	We should promote a plant-based diet
__label__noRel	Helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country they are living in are critical to successful integration. Language and norms of the job market and workplace should also be built in.	We should stop making one-cent coins
__label__noRel	allow it to be handed out to charities for consumption by those in need.	The European Union, as a Union of values, should limit its support to countries that do not want to adhere to European values and violate the rights of their citizens
__label__noRel	We need to realize the truth of what's out there. Truthful and open research without bias or stigmas.	EU institutions should prioritize the struggle against all forms of racism, also anti-Muslim bigotry, and antisemitism
__label__noRel	The undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.	Coronavirus protection should be advertised on TV and social media
__label__noRel	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU. Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.	There should be no illegal migration.
__label__noRel	Immigrants cannot work because they don't speak the required language.	We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.
__label__noRel	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels.	There should be a single EU policy.
__label__noRel	Maybe while helping economic integration in Africa to happen, we will discover that we could go further in our own EU development. We could foster transnational companies which operate on both continents but not primarily the very big ones. I think of companies that supply solar power solutions to rural areas or microcredit banks. Create platforms where best choice and best practice solutions can evolve. This way, we can establish a single common market.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	Integrating an immigrant into the EU is costly.	We should not produce unnecessary garbage
__label__noRel	The shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens. And it is not in line with the fundamental rights the EU is supposed to put into practice.	There should be a European Common Defence and Security Alliance
__label__noRel	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.	EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen”
__label__noRel	We need to stop all funding to NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. Then can we talk about how to help the people already here and how to help real people in need.	We should fight racism in the EU
__label__noRel	We must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU
__label__noRel	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	Respect for human rights and effort sharing, and solidarity should be common sense in EU member states. Unfortunately, they're not yet.	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed
__label__noRel	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.	We should invest in R&D
__label__noRel	Anonymity is at least as much as important as Identity. Today it is very easy to be anonymous, but hard to prove the identity of opinion and establish a public web of trust. Anonymity enables powerful identities to control the messages, and therefore the identity-seeking masses.	We should support Frontex.
__label__noRel	Halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU.	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__noRel	Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.	The EU should reduce its influence on its member states.
__label__noRel	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts.	We need a revision of the current asylum policy in the European Union.
__label__noRel	t is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	Every young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least
__label__noRel	Without a change in the voting procedure, Europe will not be capable of doing much in this world.	We should protect the European border.
__label__noRel	Hungary’s and Poland’s governments have ruthlessly corrupted their judgments to get a free card on abstract EU funds. Enough! If even Romania can be carried out to join the enhanced cooperation, those last two must be forced.	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.
__label__noRel	The EU needs a humane, civilized, and legal way to manage migration, whether it is for economic reasons or to seek international protection.	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__noRel	There is a huge void to fill regarding the EU-wide news media. There are media that on purpose refuse to cover the EU and our common European problems and successes.	The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe
__label__noRel	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.	We should improve migration policies
__label__noRel	Europe needs more women to have children and raise them in a good manner, which helps transmit our culture: our culture is a praise to the world and must be saved from globalization invasion and destruction.	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__noRel	The traditional family is the cornerstone of European civilization.	Climate neutrality can be achieved only by nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Economies within a short distance, decentralization, and localization can be efficient tools for protecting the climate and the environment. Less transportation, consumption of local resources, and a high level of self-reliance in the energy and food sector lead to lower carbon footprints.	We should protect the European border
__label__noRel	The human rights-based approach should be the core principle. Legal channels for entry and fostering an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as key tools to address the social impact of migration flows are necessary.	EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen”
__label__noRel	Psychedelic medicines specifically have the potential to radically transform our mental health care.	We need Integrated migration and border policy.

__label__noRel	Massive cuts to the research budget are leading to a tremendous brain drain and are destroying Europe as the home of scientific excellence.	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__noRel	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.
__label__noRel	There has to be a general awareness that the real price of throw-away products and mass-produced foods is paid in the long run and that continuing down the current path will lead to more problems than having to adjust one's consumer behavior.	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people
__label__noRel	We must support countries that want to improve the welfare and rights of their citizens. If a country wants to join the EU and meets the conditions for joining, the decision to join is solely between the candidate country and the EU.	The EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO

__label__noRel	Microplastics are everywhere nowadays: in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. It is said that we consume a credit card's worth of plastics every week. This must stop before we consume an apple's worth of plastics every week.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society.

We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate
__label__noRel	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU

__label__noRel	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__noRel	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU. Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.	We should end animal abuse

__label__noRel	The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used in the aviation sector right now. SAFs are not made from fossil fuels, but from CO2 that has been taken out of the air recently, either by biological processes or through technology.	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection
__label__noRel	The EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off.	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.

The current situation is unsatisfactory and even dangerous.	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__noRel	Including Russia in our sphere of friendship would allow the EU to discuss certain values from within and coax them toward democracy and change.

__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__noRel	Yes, child abuse is a terrible crime, but there must be another way, which won't introduce surveillance of all. This surveillance would affect all people and violate their rights to privacy. It could (and probably would) end up abused by hackers, totalitarian regimes, etc. for censorship of free speech. There is no such thing as a backdoor only for the good guys.	We should protect the European border.
__label__noRel	The proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms
__label__noRel	EU leaders continue their naive policy of hosting millions of migrants from Muslim countries without taking into consideration the inability to integrate into society even after many generations, and the fact that the Muslim diaspora is controlled by their countries of origin, the most flagrant example is the interference of Turkey and its dictator Erdogan in the German elections calling the Turkish diaspora to boycott this election since none of the candidates please him.

And as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are doing constantly dividing work between member states.

Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence. Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start. If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially. This crucial step will enforce European democracy, the Democracy of Citizens that feel free and respected within European borders.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__noRel	We live in the XXI century. We do not want any repression of peripheries by their state center.

__label__noRel	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.	Europe should have stronger borders

Also, this will lead to a better relationship with African Union and enable better livelihoods for African farmers and citizens,	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens

__label__noRel	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger.	Public transport in EU cities should be free

__label__noRel	If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, e.g. in France where English is being thought in French. language.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__noRel	This is just evidence.

The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__noRel	It is not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognizing patterns, reasons, and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in a vacuum.

We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU

Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__noRel	Agreed. Only if we show that criminals don't have a place in the EU, we can convince our citizens that refugees aren't that much of a threat. Making the checking process that each refugee has to go through public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can just come here and we need to close our borders.	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.
__label__noRel	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border.	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries
__label__noRel	Esperanto is politically neutral: it is not used by any European nation. Although there is some culture connected to the language, there is no political or economic power imposing it.

Europe should stand together!
__label__noRel	Democracy and civilization are the essences of Europe and the EU must uphold those values.

We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians
__label__noRel	Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions. Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe. The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable!

__label__noRel	The demographic problems for the EU, which are real, must be solved by encouraging child-bearing and a generous family policy, not through migration. We must celebrate motherhood and Moms. We must realize that raising a child involves serious costs in today's Europe.	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__noRel	The only meaningful immigration is when there is a member country with a specific vacancy. That member will also be responsible for the integration (at a cost of Euro 167,000).

__label__noRel	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress.

We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__noRel	The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 Frenchman would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own above people whose countries the Americans have bombed to shreds.

__label__noRel	Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).

There was an attempt to reform the blue card directive by the Junker commission in order to create a new streamlined EU-wide visa category, similar to the short-lived Schengen visa. The holder of the new blue-card-like visa would have the entire EU labor market at their disposal.	The EU needs a European research center
__label__noRel	The World, in particular Africa and the Middle East, is experiencing a huge population explosion. They seem not to be able to cope with it as China did. Who is going to take all these millions of refugees which result from it? Also, consider that the integration of one non-western immigrant costs 167.000 euros. If the EU intends to survive it has to stop more or less all migration.	EU citizens should be allowed to direct vote for more decisions
__label__noRel	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.

We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.	International cooperation with third countries in the field of migration should be developed
__label__noRel	NGOs are often America's way of interfering in European elections. NGOs must be policed more vigilantly to prevent America from interfering in our elections.	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__noRel	Natural materials have a large carbon footprint. They require fresh water and land, contributing to the pressure on nature and resources around the world.	We should make living wages a human right

__label__noRel	The random radical constitutional foundation of the EU only riles hesitant populaces without solving a particular problem.	We need a stand-alone European army.
__label__noRel	Respect for human rights and effort sharing, and solidarity should be common sense in EU member states. Unfortunately, they're not yet.	We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging
__label__noRel	We should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.	We need an integrated migration and border policy.

I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.	Coronavirus protection should be advertised on TV and social media
__label__noRel	There is a reason why these states don't want to join the common currency: their economies are more flexible and doing far better without it.

__label__noRel	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution. It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament.	We should adopt an extension of the application of qualified majority voting arrangements
__label__noRel	A European army is not only needed to attack and defend but to give weight to European words.	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	What are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money?

__label__noRel	Quotas are always disgusting examples of oppression and evil. I don't want anything of that, I want freedom and free choice.	We should protect the European border
__label__noRel	The EU should treat economic migrants with more vigilance. They cannot be the solution to the aging European population. We need more focus on border control to curb illegal migration.	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
__label__noRel	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps?	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__noRel	A psychological examination should be part of child screening, together with counseling to parents (e.g. dealing with children’s own concerns and fears, or increasing self-confidence among children and parents). It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognize them in the home and learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health.	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	This will add to the transparency and fair competition. Insincere employers shouldn't have an advantage, and in essence, it would be beneficial for all EU members, not just the workers.	We should change our consumption habits
__label__noRel	Nuclear power is safe - there are over 400 nuclear power plants globally, most of which have operated with no issues for the last 40 years, providing 24/7 electricity and preventing pollution and CO2 emissions. In terms of safety, including all accidents and pollution, nuclear power has caused 0.07 deaths/TWh, which is 40x less than natural gas and comparable with wind power (OurWorldInData 2021).	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need.
__label__noRel	In addition to this, schools and companies canteens should be required to serve mainly plant-based meals in order to reduce their impact and to educate their users.	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people

__label__noRel	The rule of law varies from country to country, due to the fact that the concept developed in each country under the influence of local traditions.

__label__noRel	creating a European sustainability tax for all products and services from inside and outside the EU based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations will make all unsustainable products more expensive and sustainable products more competitive	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools

Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__noRel	Immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration.	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
__label__noRel	I fully agree that people should not be incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses. Drug addiction should be treated as a health issue. Drug addicts need help. Incarceration does not help them.	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection
__label__noRel	It is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!	We should have legal migration channels.
__label__noRel	The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.	We need to build up European Defence while remaining in NATO
__label__noRel	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	We should end mass migration together.
__label__noRel	All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified. Refugees/migrants are not to be expelled, certainly not immediately, but to be included in the employment problems and economic situation.	We should decriminalize drug use
__label__noRel	Illegal loopholes in the legislation are enabling illegal migration. Family Reunification has been and remains the biggest channel of migration into the EU.	We should ban domestic air traffic
__label__noRel	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people.	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language

Plato, Socrates, Hayek, Borovský, Auberon Herbert, Herbert Spencer, Roger Scruton, Ronald Reagan (speeches), Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson ...

__label__noRel	I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	We have already English as a language of exchange.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society.
__label__noRel	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns.

We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language
__label__noRel	An EU army independent from NATO and its US commanders is critical to strategic autonomy and avoiding being dragged into destructive US wars in the Middle East like in the past.	We should reintroduce nuclear power in Germany
__label__noRel	The EU is not responsible for the entire World.	We should put a cap on personal wealth and annual income
__label__noRel	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely.	We need legal ways of migration.
__label__noRel	I have also seen ex-soldiers shaking after someone sets off loud fireworks. Yes they should be banned. Abhorrent things.	We should abolish covid digital pass
__label__noRel	The EU member states need to lift together instead of trying to push the burdens onto each other or external nations.	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy

__label__noRel	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them. We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.
__label__noRel	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate. The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country. There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes. Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__noRel	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.' The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.	We need a better EU migration policy
__label__noRel	Across the EU, young people are continuing to face a number of significant challenges to enter and get a stable position in the labor market. They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are particularly affected. So we need a fairer migration policy but also consider migrant needs (and challenges) in other policy areas.	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	To reduce poverty and inequalities, the EU should develop a legal framework guaranteeing minimum social standards, including decent living and working conditions as well as adequate social protection.	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy

__label__noRel	Frontex is a key agency and is called to play a crucial role in the coming years. Yet, it lacks the necessary political support it deserves to carry out its mission.	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants
__label__noRel	We are all for equal rights and opportunities for women, however, modern feminism has gone so far beyond the pale that it can no longer be supported. The BBC has recently found out that 'Some lesbians are increasingly being pressured and coerced into accepting trans women as sexual partners' - in effect fourth-wave feminism has reached the point where males are once again telling females who to have sex with. This must stop.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants

__label__noRel	Why can't Arab countries shelter refugees from other Arab countries? Same habits, religion and they have enough wealth.	We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East
__label__noRel	As Europe bears the burden of the XXth century authoritarian regimes (right and left) and saw their children ideologically possessed by fascist and communist governmental propaganda (Hitlerjugend (right) and Pioneer (left) movements), we need to limit the access of the children - as one of the most vulnerable groups of our community - to every political ideology and propagating associations.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals. It would be good for every person to be given psychotherapeutic advice once a year in order to be able to diagnose and treat mental disorders and illnesses at an early stage or even to prevent them.	We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions
__label__noRel	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed

__label__noRel	The hub could also organize events to spread awareness in the local population on topics related to migration, in order to boost social inclusion processes and fight the spreading of fake news and ostracism of migrant people.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__noRel	This is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.

__label__noRel	Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions. Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe. The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable!	The EU must be confederal and not federal

__label__noRel	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration
__label__noRel	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it. We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control. I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic.	We should stop subsidizing mass livestock farms
__label__noRel	We should not bring the problem to Europe, but we should rather help where it is needed in their region!	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.	We need better ways of migration.

__label__noRel	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU. Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__noRel	From the Association Christian in Democracy (Spain), we are clear that life is the greatest good of a society and as such must be protected from its conception to its natural end.

We should stop subsidizing mass livestock farms
__label__noRel	It is necessary that member states better share the efforts of receiving asylum seekers upon arrival at EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to frontline countries. The EU should develop a joint approach to support the frontline countries to assure that asylum seeker are provided adequate care, assistance, and protection upon arrival and are quickly distributed evenly throughout the EU for status determination.

__label__noRel	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure.

But to convince them to grow green we have to acknowledge that we are denying them the way to build their economy as we did in the past 200 years. So we must support emerging countries in their transition to a green economy.	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need.
__label__noRel	It is important to see immigrants as people who have a culture, a religious perspective, and a very different but respectable idea of sociality compared to the European one. That's why we must act in a coordinated and careful manner between institutions and organizations.	We should decriminalize drug use
__label__noRel	Not taking climate impact and biodiversity loss into account makes it difficult for businesses to move towards a more virtuous system.	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.

__label__noRel	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__noRel	I believe the EU should expedite the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans, to help them evolve and facilitate the reconciliation problems. As you say, Montenegro for instance is a peaceful country that has made efforts to overcome past troubles, and that too should be acknowledged.	We should adopt an extension of the application of qualified majority voting arrangements
__label__noRel	The Covid-19 pandemic showed us that the European Union is not able to come up with technological innovations that could strengthen our economic position.	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Organizing, promoting, directing and financing mass migration is a crime against humanity.	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools
__label__noRel	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop, With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today.	The EU needs a free but correct press
__label__noRel	The EU should acknowledge the fact that increasing birth rates in Europe, and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most appropriate long-term solution.	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU

A UK study has shown that drugs such as cannabis and many hallucinogenic drugs are far less harmful than alcohol. The study in question was conducted by David J Nutt, Leslie A King, Lawrence D Phillips, on behalf of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__noRel	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.	The EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom
__label__noRel	Eventually, the best solution would be a world wide agreement (as within OECD and like minded) such as the global minimum tax rate.

We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__noRel	The random radical constitutional foundation of the EU only riles hesitant populaces without solving a particular problem.	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
__label__noRel	Mass migration is an evil that hurts the nations as well as the migrants themselves, who suffer indignities and risk their lives. We must end mass migration. This requires that migrants be helped as close to the origin of migration as possible.	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.

__label__noRel	There is no generation technology that comes with zero risks, and this is why we need to look at objective scientific indicators.	We should change our consumption habits
__label__noRel	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions.

__label__noRel	We haven't got enough jobs and money for everyone in Europe! Stop immigration! However, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia have it! These countries can therefore welcome migrants instead of funding hundreds of mosques in Europe!	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR), ‘[a]ll peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The right to self-determination also has its economic content which gives the people the right to freely ‘dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law.'	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries

Temporary jobs, precarious contracts, civic contracts replacing regular employment, forced self-employment, lack of basic social protection, and even age-discriminatory practices (also on the basis of age) are still the norm for millions of young people who are trying to make their way in the labor market. They need urgent help!	Europe should stand together!
__label__noRel	France should offer its seat on the UN Security Council, so European interests are represented.	The current differing legal cultures of the Member States need to be developed into a common legal culture in Europe
__label__noRel	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration.	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government.
__label__noRel	The proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__noRel	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__noRel	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.	We should prohibit certain energy-intensive cryptocurrencies
__label__noRel	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities
__label__noRel	This idea is what we have been doing for the last 30 years. It did not produce sufficient results to justify continuing on this path. It is just saying, that problem will solve itself. This proposition is harmful and does not stand on any data that could justify it.	We should limit population growth in overcrowded regions
__label__noRel	Without change, the EU will be following the route of the USSR and other communist countries, who after 70 years of trying to build a social paradise ended in poverty and suppression.	We need a better distribution of refugees
__label__noRel	It makes no difference where we place the population of the world. Either in or out of EU, the western way of living is unsustainable.	We should protect the European border.
__label__noRel	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__noRel	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)

__label__noRel	Worldwide, nuclear power has prevented emissions of 240 billion tonnes of CO2 and prevented 1.8 million lives due to prevented air pollution (Kharecha, Hansen 2013).	We should protect the European border.
__label__noRel	it is essential that environmental concerns and sustainability are the foundation of any treaty with our European Union!	We should limit the use of fireworks
__label__noRel	The future is 'work mobility'; thus we need to simplify taxation, enhance remote working opportunities, and enable inter-country recruitment for companies.	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.
__label__noRel	Such a hub could also have a bridging role between local necessities and opportunities at the EU level, such as project funding.	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__noRel	There are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.	We should make pushbacks legal
__label__noRel	Agree. If the asylum seekers don't have to cross the Mediterranean to apply for it less of them will die trying and less human trafficking will take place.	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__noRel	The only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans. This must change.	We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians
__label__noRel	As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.	We should limit the use of fireworks
__label__noRel	The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used in the aviation sector right now. SAFs are not made from fossil fuels, but from CO2 that has been taken out of the air recently, either by biological processes or through technology.	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles
__label__noRel	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from
__label__noRel	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration.
__label__noRel	But also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	In my point of view it will be essential to impose some compensatory levies on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage.	People from radical Muslim countries should be banned from entering the EU countries
__label__noRel	The COVID crisis has shown, that we are very vulnerable. Critical industries must stay in Europe. Infrastructure in the EU especially critical infrastructure must remain under full and absolute European control.	The EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe.
__label__noRel	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense.	We need a combined education and migration policy for Africa and the Middle East.
__label__noRel	Direct democracy is too open to manipulation by populists and malefactors via social media. A transparent representative democracy with a solid lid on lobbyism is to be preferred.	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__noRel	European Union has already forgotten for example about the Ingrian Finnish indigenous nation. We have our own unique flag, our own unique language (that only about 1300 people speak in the entire world), our own land that the Ingrian Finnish lived on before Russia took over Karelia and sent them all to labor work in Siberia, Karelian forests and Estonia.	The federal features of the European Treaties need to be strengthened.
__label__noRel	What does it mean to have a mere CO2eq. indicator? That's utter nonsense as there are many more impact categories.	Imprisonment of foreign criminals should be carried out in their country
__label__noRel	Fish are sentient and failure to afford them the same legal protections that we provide other animals is a gross moral and legal oversight.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__noRel	During the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states. Gathering the strength of the 27 member states in research and health could be a real asset for the EU and its citizens, but also for its influence overseas and its independence.	We need better ways of migration.
__label__noRel	Glass is one of the biggest causes of human death for birds.	We should preserve European culture

__label__noRel	Many countries have the view that unauthorized asylum seekers should be removed.	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__noRel	Unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants have no right to be in the country where they are unauthorized.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__noRel	EU lacks a common language for its citizens, which would be easy to manage for all citizens and strengthen a sense of belonging, a common European identity while preserving their national identities.	We should reduce animal farming.
__label__noRel	Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden's Stockholm has become the Rape Capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has skyrocketed as well in that country. France is bordering on civil war, whole territories are not under state control anymore. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We need to put our European peoples first, much like the entire world is doing while our civilization is committing suicide based on values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists.	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making
__label__noRel	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU. The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU. Almost all people are without a useful education. There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.	The EU needs human security approach to ensure peace.
__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.	We need a better migration policy.
__label__noRel	This is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.	There should be no illegal migration.
__label__noRel	It shouldn't be the European families who pay for the damage caused by multinational corporations.	Alternative medicine should be more accepted
__label__noRel	It is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries

The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now.	The EU should start accession negotiations with Russia
__label__noRel	We need to stop all funding to NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. Then can we talk about how to help the people already here and how to help real people in need.	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources
__label__noRel	This should help to tackle the causes of lack of prospects and absconding from these countries in order to increase the willingness of young people to stay in their homes	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need.

__label__noRel	A migrant, with the proper education and support, will in his turn contribute for society, which allows more people to have a fulfilling life.	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government.

__label__noRel	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate
__label__noRel	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments.	The EU needs human security approach to ensure peace.

There are texts thousands of years old and also recent books ... you can start anywhere you wish ...	There should be a European Common Defence and Security Alliance
__label__noRel	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model.	We should prevent the surveillance state
__label__noRel	Research, and in particular open-ended curiosity-driven research, is the essential solid bedrock on which a better and more innovative Europe can be built.	Frontex should regularly publish transparency reports
__label__noRel	I think the problem in the EU is the incompetence to establish inventions in the market. There are lots of inventions that are made and funded by public EU research facilities brought into the market by small startups. In the end, they are picked like ripe fruits by the US or Chinese companies where the big money is made.	The EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO
__label__noRel	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU. EU does not equal to Europe
__label__noRel	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.	Wind and solar energy resources are a commodity, provided by big companies.
__label__noRel	I opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.	We should create a pan-European train company

__label__noRel	Turkey is encroaching on EU territory, Russia is sending its army to the Ukrainian border, and what can we do? Nothing, because nobody is taking us seriously. Our threats are empty and get ignored, and our diplomacy is weak. It's time for the EU to be recognized as a strong force that can and will protect its people and its interests.	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__noRel	The subsidies were originally intended to ensure the security of supply for the European population. But when you export subsidized food, it's at the expense of European taxpayers. Export yes, but then no more subsidies for these products.	We should put in place policies for the protection of insects
__label__noRel	limiting the number of plastic types used for packaging will ease the process of its recycling	We should implement minimum EU social standards
__label__noRel	Legal traditions are different for a reason. They are the result of centuries of organic legal evolution. They cannot be overwritten with a stroke of a pen.	Alternative medicine should be more accepted
__label__noRel	It should be the common goal of EU diplomacy to change the workings of the UN as it is. The security council is a relict of the emerging post-WW2 order and the influence of the Cold War.	We should not subsidize large agricultural groups
__label__noRel	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements.

__label__noRel	It has to work like with air travel: Book a coherent journey from A to B operated by different companies, and be sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (rebooking, ...).	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU
__label__noRel	Discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.	We should preserve bees and polling insects

__label__noRel	Space mining may be neat science fiction, but I doubt it could ever become a commercially feasible activity. Aside from the environmental impact of launching vehicles into space, moving the mined materials to Earth would pose its own challenges. Entry into the atmosphere and arrival on Earth is dangerous. Having thousands of tons of mined matter go through this process seems destined to end up with frequent disasters.	We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East
__label__noRel	Living in Europe is not a human right. Illegal migrants are willing to break a law and risk their lives (and the lives of their families), while unable to undergo the proper legal and established process and paperwork.	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.

__label__noRel	Eventually, the best solution would be a world wide agreement (as within OECD and like minded) such as the global minimum tax rate.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands.
__label__noRel	The EU should continue its enlargement to the Western Balkans to further its own interests, and to bring stability and prosperity to the region. Serbia should have joined long ago.	Europe should establish a common Army across Europe
__label__noRel	NGO boats should be forbidden, only Frontex should intervene to bring them home	We should abolish the European Council
__label__noRel	As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__noRel	We should never ever allow any nuclear power after Fukushima!	We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage
__label__noRel	If we need work force, we should look for Europeans to come, not for Afrikans, Arabic, and Muslims.	We should reduce animal farming.
__label__noRel	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity. It would turn Europe into a polarized entity much like the American system and would firmly divide the European community on every issue.	Germany should start paying reparations share for any damaged countries of Europe up to 100 years after its attack on international society
__label__noRel	We need to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in centers for repatriation.	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately
__label__noRel	Extremely important thing for an informed decision of the citizens e.g. in the supermarket.	Food whose production has been subsidized with EU funds should not be allowed to be exported to developing countries.
__label__noRel	Many countries have the view that unauthorized asylum seekers should be removed.	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
__label__noRel	CBAM is a central element towards a global approach to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and to mitigate global warming	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__noRel	I find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice. Just as I can move myself, my family, furniture, car, and bank accounts freely within the EU, I should have the same right to move and merge my pensions into a single unit.	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__noRel	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.	We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states
__label__noRel	Ukraine is a part of Europe—geographically, diplomatically, and culturally. If Ukraine wants to join the EU, we should grant our brothers and sisters full membership in our Union.	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__noRel	Nuclear power is safe - there are over 400 nuclear power plants globally, most of which have operated with no issues for the last 40 years, providing 24/7 electricity and preventing pollution and CO2 emissions. In terms of safety, including all accidents and pollution, nuclear power has caused 0.07 deaths/TWh, which is 40x less than natural gas and comparable with wind power (OurWorldInData 2021).	We should establish a Russian interest including EU policy.
__label__noRel	It will take years before the local farmers will be able to give well paid jobs to the local workers. In the meantime you'll have a famine and a genocide. And I didn't even mention the effects of a sudden huge inflation wave.	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
__label__noRel	According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR), ‘[a]ll peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The right to self-determination also has its economic content which gives the people the right to freely ‘dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law.'	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes
__label__noRel	While it is only promoted/suggested and not a mandatory, its ok.	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East.
__label__noRel	Europe has signed the UN charta on human rights. Also, Europe has the resources to design a fair and safe migration system so that the death of refugees in the Mediterranean sea stops.	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech
__label__noRel	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.	We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender
__label__noRel	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__noRel	biofuel is much nonsense as would require huge areas and resources to be produced.	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries
__label__noRel	To build a common European understanding and to create a European identity, we need our own common language.	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	Each migrant in the European Union must be given the possibility to integrate even if the refugee status is not clear. Integration programs could support this development in all cases.	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters
__label__noRel	Pragmatism was in the EU’s DNA since its inception, but this is sadly no longer the case. The current EU is not a moral authority, it is a political organization based on mutual interests and political diversity.	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__noRel	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__noRel	A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations, and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__noRel	With highly subsidized agricultural products the EU destroys local markets in African countries. This procedure should be stopped as soon as possible. EU agricultural subsidies should be replaced with incentives and support for a sustainable transition. The earlier we abandon these unfair and highly unsustainable subsidies the better for our own future health, social development, and climate future. Also, this will lead to a better relationship with African Union and enable better livelihoods for African farmers and citizens,	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.
__label__noRel	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.	We should have legal migration channels.
__label__noRel	There is scientific consensus on the fact that fish have the ability to feel pain and emotions such as fear.	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__noRel	supporting short-distance economies can help kick off the development of localized small-scale economies.	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency
__label__noRel	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model.	Coronavirus protection should be advertised on TV and social media
__label__noRel	Knowledge of the host country's language is essential for integration. When migrants understand the local language, studies show that their values tend towards those of the host countries over time.	Europe should establish a common Army across Europe
__label__noRel	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__noRel	Every harpy screams 'more (black) women in power' until Candace Owens appears. Clever, charming black woman, but she is too clever, pro-freedom, and conservative, and that is the problem. So it isn't about women, it's mere greed and desire for power and influence.	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration.
__label__noRel	No more immigration from non-European or non-first world countries.	We need a better distribution of refugees.
__label__noRel	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.	Europe must help Ukraine
__label__noRel	We must protect our Planet, and without bees, wasps, or other arthropods, we go to our own extinction!	We should develop a strategy for the EU defense in relation to NATO

__label__noRel	Stop woke ideology introducing Orwellian newspeak!	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__noRel	I opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax
__label__noRel	Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
__label__noRel	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__noRel	A great idea because it definitely lowers the threshold.	Europe is getting older and should be open to more migration from Asia, and southeast Asia.
__label__noRel	As the sustainability goals of the UN contain working conditions, human rights, environmental & climate issues together with questions of governance, they are ideal to incentivize sustainability in all sectors and fend off unsustainable practices and competition.	The Commission should remove any mention of gender and other ideology from its research funds and calls.
__label__noRel	Family Reunification creates unbearable levels of migration and acute problems of integration for several EU Member States.	The EU must use its weight as a united global player in trade policy and put an end to foreclosure
__label__noRel	Multiculturalism will enhance our society.	The EU should focus on pragmatism
__label__noRel	The United States is investing an average of more or less 25 million euros per year on health care research for people with Trisomy 21 while the European Union is lagging far behind with only 3 million per year. This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21.	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax
__label__noRel	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us.	We should ban cryptocurrencies
__label__noRel	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	What are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money? The religion? The food? Their political system? And then reevaluate each year? This comment is plain ignorant.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
__label__noRel	We need to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in centers for repatriation.	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Direct democracy is too open to manipulation by populists and malefactors via social media. A transparent representative democracy with a solid lid on lobbyism is to be preferred.	The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	There should be a small council of people from all over the world, and identify the problems of every country and solve them.
__label__noRel	The attempt to shove the postmodern version of liberalism down Europeans' throats has contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU.	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__noRel	The more language communication skills around the closer we can get in this complicated world we live in. The fact it is a popular language around the world but not really recognized in Europe should change. I fully endorse its recognition in Europe.	We should have legal migration channels.

__label__noRel	The problem of youth employment has been there for a long time but was underlined again during the pandemic. Many young people are forced to move to a different country in order to find work.	Solar and wind energies have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	A good idea to end online trolls and haters. Easy to set up, it is a very good short-term solution, but fake news, unfortunately, escapes this regulation. So there is a need for other measures to attack the algorithms of the social networks themselves.	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__noRel	The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.	EU institutions should prioritize the struggle against all forms of racism, also anti-Muslim bigotry, and antisemitism
__label__noRel	Esperanto should be promoted as an international lingua franca. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of cross-cultural communication, allowing high degrees of inclusion.	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.
__label__noRel	A common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data. The data should be accessible for public research and used for monitoring public health e.g. by European institutions	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	The attempt to shove the postmodern version of liberalism down Europeans' throats has contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU.	The EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO
__label__noRel	As we are sometimes required to move for work (mobility of workforce) it would be great, if all EU countries accept a language or format of official documents.	We need to invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Since the EU was developed, little progress and much stagnation have been made.	We should stop immigration.
__label__noRel	To have a chance that one candidate (with a good chance to win) comes from your own country, I think people from little countries can wait 40 years. This will definitely destroy the European belonging feeling you want to promote with this idea.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__noRel	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.	Europe should stand together!
__label__noRel	I am ashamed that I am European right now. We are keeping refugees behind walls and on islands like savages. They don't want to run from their home country. Who are we ok to deny them the right to exist?	The EU should start accession negotiations with Russia
__label__noRel	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.	The EU should promote organizations that teach the national language via Esperanto
__label__noRel	Frontex is a key agency and is called to play a crucial role in the coming years. Yet, it lacks the necessary political support it deserves to carry out its mission.	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__noRel	allow it to be handed out to charities for consumption by those in need.	We need better ways of migration.
__label__noRel	Yes, and it should be payed out to every citizen of the EU. Those people with a lower CO2 footprint - typically lower income family - would greatly benefit from it and be incentivized to invest in cleaner energy, heating etc.	We need a better distribution of refugees
__label__noRel	In Conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we are making business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '	We should sponsor the general population for taking in migrants
__label__noRel	All refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left.	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.
__label__noRel	The European Union is not a country and we must respect other countries' electoral choices.	There should be no illegal migration
__label__noRel	I wholeheartedly agree. Securing our neighbors and allies has to be a priority. The only thing that causes me some dismay is Turkey being a part of NATO. It was a good idea in 1951 but clearly, Turkey must be out off the map now.	Toilet paper should be made of recycled paper only
__label__noRel	Very large natural areas need to be protected to promote wildlife and the return of self-sustaining and fertile biodiversity!	We should promote a culture of exchange and sharing of goods and services
__label__noRel	Currently the ETS only applies to certain carbon-emitting industries covering 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. To effectively combat climate change 40% is not enough. That is why the ETS has to be expanded to at least cover agriculture and transport as well. In Addition to the extension of the ETS the subsidies in fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) must be cut in the near future.	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU
__label__noRel	In fact, political NGOs advocating for any cause whatsoever should be banned from schools and kindergartens.	We should ban wild animals in circuses
__label__noRel	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	We should promote a plant-based diet
__label__noRel	I think the EU should subsidies troubled cash-strapped cities to reduce ticket prices or completely remove any charges so that people are vivisected to hop on the bus rather than in the car.

__label__noRel	A great idea because it definitely lowers the threshold.	We need stricter and homogeneous environmental legislation across the EU

__label__noRel	Marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists!	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU
__label__noRel	Marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists!	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	We have already English as a language of exchange.	Europe should have stronger borders
__label__noRel	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.	The EU should have open borders with poor countries
__label__noRel	We must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.	We should introduce a European citizenship
__label__noRel	The European Union is not a country and we must respect other countries' electoral choices.	We should end mass migration together.
__label__noRel	The migration pressure from Africa towards Europe results from a significant difference in perceived quality of life. It is in the interest of the EU and its member states to reduce that difference by working with the AU to level up and develop African nations.	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__noRel	Absolutely right. Europe needs an army for continental defense. Conscription must be introduced at the European level. The army must have the most modern weapons to deter Russia, Turkey, and China.	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.

__label__noRel	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	We should limit the use of fireworks
__label__noRel	Africa and the Middle East have the highest birthrate in the World. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1,55. It is this high birthrate that keeps them poor. There is almost nothing the EU can do about it.	We need to build up European Defence while remaining in NATO
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable.	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities

__label__noRel	Technology brings people together when they are distant, accelerates bureaucratic procedures, it allows us to work from home or from any country in the EU or outside. It allows for an immense flow of information to be easily accessible to us. As long as people do not want to do illegal online activities, it is each person’s individual decision what to do with their own online time or how much time they might want to be online.	The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe
__label__noRel	The dividing of refugees is a long-discussed plan. But in the end, no involved group agreed with these plans. Some countries do not like these people at all.	We should increase the salaries of artisans

__label__noRel	Turkey is an enemy. It uses this deal to make a threat. Stop it now and send patrols to the Greek border or welcome them.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__noRel	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people.

__label__noRel	A European Wealth Fund should be created to serve as the nexus for strategic investments in European and international economic activity aligning with European fundamental rights, norms, and values and the global green and digital transition.	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness
__label__noRel	No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget.

__label__noRel	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.	We need a better distribution of refugees.

Just as I can move myself, my family, furniture, car, and bank accounts freely within the EU, I should have the same right to move and merge my pensions into a single unit.	We should be aware of migration due to climate change
__label__noRel	I highly support this. As Jonathan Foer puts it in his book 'We are the weather': Changing our diet will not suffice to save the planet, but we won't save it unless we eat differently.	We should put a higher tax or a toll on imported meat from abroad.

The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.	There should be no illegal migration.

__label__noRel	I disagree, each country must be sovereign to establish its migration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
__label__noRel	I agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.	We should reduce animal farming.
__label__noRel	A European Wealth Fund should be created to serve as the nexus for strategic investments in European and international economic activity aligning with European fundamental rights, norms, and values and the global green and digital transition.	Migration should not be the solution.
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, but unfortunately it's framed as a British/brexit issue. However, the wider concept of a common EU visa / migration system is a compelling one. Harmonising the system to a common visa regime offers many advantages.	We should embrace the future of GMO

We need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy.
__label__noRel	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years.	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU

__label__noRel	Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
__label__noRel	All animals from dogs, cats, birds, cows, pigs, and horses (the list is long) suffer from human use of fireworks! The high bursts and flashes cause anxiety in the body.	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__noRel	Migrants sell drugs.	Migration should not be the solution.
__label__noRel	In the case of nuclear power, cooling is needed to prevent a meltdown. And if water is not available because of drought or freezing, earthquake or tsunami, etc, these gigantic steam engines have to be shut down, otherwise, they will produce highly hazardous outcomes.	We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions
__label__noRel	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms
__label__noRel	No more immigration! It has already come at too large of a cost. The EU must provide channels for the European people to democratically vote for the mass deportation of migrants.	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency
__label__noRel	There is a huge void to fill regarding the EU-wide news media. There are media that on purpose refuse to cover the EU and our common European problems and successes.	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__noRel	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate. The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country. There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes. Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	Every young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least
__label__noRel	But also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness
__label__noRel	Tax should be compulsory, not voluntary! Yes, the EU needs to collect direct taxes! For example, taxes on companies, and green taxes (tax on non-recycled items, tax on carbon, etc), as all should be harmonized across the EU.	We should make pushbacks legal
__label__noRel	I think the problem in the EU is the incompetence to establish inventions in the market. There are lots of inventions that are made and funded by public EU research facilities brought into the market by small startups. In the end, they are picked like ripe fruits by the US or Chinese companies where the big money is made.	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries
__label__noRel	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.	European Union should help young people to train in refugee countries
__label__noRel	The nations must have the final say regarding whom they want to allow to live on their sovereign territories.	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__noRel	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments.	We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.
__label__noRel	Research, and in particular open-ended curiosity-driven research, is the essential solid bedrock on which a better and more innovative Europe can be built.	We should support agroforestry
__label__noRel	Sustainable development and climate change mitigation in EU Trade deals should be examples of best practices of EU policy.	The EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it
__label__noRel	We can work together to encourage plant based diets and make the world a better place.	The EU should establish a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
__label__noRel	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution. It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament.	Doctors should be paid based on how many people they successfully treated
__label__noRel	Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions. Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe. The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable!	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans
__label__noRel	It is absolutely ridiculous to be spending money on these climate disastrous practices. The EU is nowhere close to keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement and is still funding unsustainable practices left and right.	Germany should start paying reparations share for any damaged countries of Europe up to 100 years after its attack on international society
__label__noRel	Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.	EU countries should slightly reduce health insurance contributions for all citizens who do not use tobacco products
__label__noRel	In Conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we are making business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '	We should promote mental health
__label__noRel	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.	We do not need any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	allow it to be handed out to charities for consumption by those in need.	We should change our consumption habits
__label__noRel	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people.	We should include young people in decision-making processes considering climate change
__label__noRel	If rural areas are to become more attractive to live in and work, it is essential to bet on innovation and the creation of quality jobs	The EU should reduce its influence on its member states.
__label__noRel	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.	Migration should not be the solution.
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work! What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__noRel	The use and promotion of civic technology contribute to a more inclusive, resident-focused urban co-governance model and build ecosystems rich in creativity and innovation, thanks to the diversity of users and perspectives that are at stake.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__noRel	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people. It is embedded in the core principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but those high and lofty principles must become a reality for all workers, old and young!	We should establish a European Army.
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy can be considered sustainable because it is cheap and can be predicted for decades, and the price of power produced by nuclear power plants is not affected by changes in the price of natural gas or other energy carriers.	The EU must use its weight as a united global player in trade policy and put an end to foreclosure
__label__noRel	With highly subsidized agricultural products the EU destroys local markets in African countries. This procedure should be stopped as soon as possible. EU agricultural subsidies should be replaced with incentives and support for a sustainable transition. The earlier we abandon these unfair and highly unsustainable subsidies the better for our own future health, social development, and climate future. Also, this will lead to a better relationship with African Union and enable better livelihoods for African farmers and citizens,	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__noRel	Sustainable development and climate change mitigation in EU Trade deals should be examples of best practices of EU policy.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__noRel	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.	Alternative medicine should be more accepted
__label__noRel	There has to be a general awareness that the real price of throw-away products and mass-produced foods is paid in the long run and that continuing down the current path will lead to more problems than having to adjust one's consumer behavior.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society
__label__noRel	Japan was a global superpower once just behind the USA, however, it has a strict immigration policy. Where is it now in global power rankings?	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.
__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.	We need Integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	The dividing of refugees is a long-discussed plan. But in the end, no involved group agreed with these plans. Some countries do not like these people at all.	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	Europe was composed of 13 countries in 1870 and 23 in 1914. Maybe it's time to change borders without bloodshed.	We should remove illegal immigrants.
__label__noRel	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat
__label__noRel	This is especially true when we know how much alcohol is damaging the brain, in particular in the developing brain of teenagers. Also unlike cannabis, over-consumption of alcohol leads to death so I would say that this product is much more dangerous. Yet unlike cannabis, alcohol is legal.	We should preserve European culture
__label__noRel	I have never heard anyone talking in Europe about world supremacy. So it seems kind of pointless that this is a goal of EU policy.	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__noRel	We are still living in a capitalism, so, the price will decide and the price of nuclear energy is the only energy price which is increasing steadily, while renewables become cheaper every year. Nuclear was always only subsidiesed by governments and never really standing on their own. The building process is slow, the price is high, no way, this could be a gain - if it weren't for the military.	The EU should focus on pragmatism
__label__noRel	Aggression, division, and violence we see in mass media should be stopped. Only the best human qualities should be promoted, this way we will raise a generation of kind, caring, and responsible people.	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__noRel	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.	The Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept.
__label__noRel	We must protect our Planet, and without bees, wasps, or other arthropods, we go to our own extinction!	Permanent non-EU nationals who are living in the European Union should have more rights.
__label__noRel	Traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine is a safe and efficient way to improve well-being, and happiness and prevent illness. Also, an innumerable amount of people have got significant palliation or even total cure in cases, which the official health care system, unfortunately, couldn't help. This is clearly an area, where countries, civilizations, and schools of thought could learn a lot from each other.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__noRel	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe
__label__noRel	This is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__noRel	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.	Europe should stand together!
__label__noRel	We are all for equal rights and opportunities for women, however, modern feminism has gone so far beyond the pale that it can no longer be supported. The BBC has recently found out that 'Some lesbians are increasingly being pressured and coerced into accepting trans women as sexual partners' - in effect fourth-wave feminism has reached the point where males are once again telling females who to have sex with. This must stop.	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the security risks for asylum seekers are greatly reduced.	We should stop daylight saving time change

__label__noRel	The migration pressure from Africa towards Europe results from a significant difference in perceived quality of life. It is in the interest of the EU and its member states to reduce that difference by working with the AU to level up and develop African nations.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__noRel	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__noRel	The migration pressure from Africa towards Europe results from a significant difference in perceived quality of life. It is in the interest of the EU and its member states to reduce that difference by working with the AU to level up and develop African nations.	The demographic decline should be stopped.
__label__noRel	The rule of law varies from country to country, due to the fact that the concept developed in each country under the influence of local traditions. It's impossible, and superfluous to develop a uniform, EU-standard conception of the rule of law.	Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond

__label__noRel	Unfortunately, the values and rights are interpreted and exercised differently in the states of the European Union. Whether we are speaking about minority protection, language rights, or cultural values. We can see every day that the EU is constantly retaliating against the Hungarians in Transylvania, when, despite the legislation in force, it ignores the lawlessness and atrocities committed against the Hungarians as a native minority. Furthermore, the European Union should give priority to all situations in which Hungarians in Transylvania are victims of discrimination.	There should be an EU citizenship
__label__noRel	The EU is in demographic decline. At the start of the 19th century, Europe accounted for 15% of the world's population. By 2050, it will be 5%.	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	The idea of a circular economy could help us to tackle the problem of overconsumption and overproduction of waste.	We should end animal abuse

__label__noRel	In order to promote European peace, prosperity, and precious diversity, a different administration system is needed: a federal Europe, based on a democratic federal constitution instead of anarchy-provoking EU treaties.	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__noRel	Helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country they are living in are critical to successful integration. Language and norms of the job market and workplace should also be built in.	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work
__label__noRel	Ukraine is infamous for its black market for weapons. Helping Ukraine by dumping weapons into such a country is folly.	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy

__label__noRel	It has to work like with air travel: Book a coherent journey from A to B operated by different companies, and be sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (rebooking, ...).	Europe should change the world for the better for everyone.
__label__noRel	IQ tests do not prevent ill-intentioned people from entering our borders. Canada aims to receive 400,000 people each year, and how intelligent or skilled they are does not matter. People working in the agricultural fields are being naturalized, relatives are being naturalized.	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.
__label__noRel	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from
__label__noRel	Agreed. Only if we show that criminals don't have a place in the EU, we can convince our citizens that refugees aren't that much of a threat. Making the checking process that each refugee has to go through public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can just come here and we need to close our borders.	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees

__label__noRel	I opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__noRel	If we continue investing in climate and environmentally damaging, regressive, and immensely expensive nuclear power plants or technologies is a mockery of the world and a waste of money and time that we can use for sustainable investments and transformations.	We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users
__label__noRel	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration.	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector
__label__noRel	The key to successful immigration depends upon the possibility of employment. So EU members are to decide whom they want to admit.	We should improve and modernize our energy infrastructure
