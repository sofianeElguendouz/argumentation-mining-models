__label__Support	Yes. This will prevent the probability of danger that hate speech usually causes.	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__Attack	As technology becomes more advanced, there are algorithms that detect hate speech, for example on Twitter.

__label__Attack	It is important to actually define what hate speech is before an agreed education policy can be enacted.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Support	If everyone is honest about what they saw.	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Support	I agree with this argument. It is important to balance the right to freedom of speech against the need to reduce hate speech.	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__Attack	I strongly agree with your opinion, however the reader comments need to be respect as a platform despite people having the right to freedom of speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

I would contend that the basis of any energy strategy, and particularly one for a listed asset, must be challenging the building occupiers expectations and requirements.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	I disagree, the person commenting can do so in a manner that isn't hateful. Only people who choose hate as their platform in getting their opinion across will be blocked. Hopefully these people rethink their approach and try again in a different manner	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view.  We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.

__label__Attack	I think people should have the right to comment but should do so respectfully.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I don't think that simply mitigating the problem should be our focus. 	If people can start separating strategies to help the earth and politics, I would be more apt to believe it.   An example is the new green deal that is being proposed in the US.  When you read it, a majority is about socialist policies and overreach of the government and is not relevant in anyway to climate change.  Other agreements let large polluters like China and India off the hook while expecting a disproportionate amount from the US.   This makes me very cynical about the overall agenda behind it.

The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__Support	I agree that the establishment will have too much power, and not be fairly represented if fair negative opinions are seen as hate speech	"some people ""troll"" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion.

__label__Attack	Hate speech is called hate speech for a reason. ALso it is not protected under the guise of freedom of speech. Not forgetting that with every right theres subsequent responsibilities	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__Attack	I think that having these echo chambers just perpetuates what may be a cognitive dissonance, you may not necessarily feel a certain way but a comment you put out may have be interpreted one way and subsequent comments would reinforce that viewpoint in a polarised echo chamber. This website explains it nicely and uses racisms as an example of how cognitive dissonance perpetuates racist behaviour. https://www.reallifepsych.com/single-post/2017/08/16/the-psychology-of-cognitive-dissonance-and-racism	"The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments.

Having news discussed by people is what sparks change in our society, so they are still important and probably shouldn't be removed!	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__Attack	Also it's not about restricting any form of hate speech, we also need to be reminded that our opinions can't be the only right one. Hate speech is hate, and a crime against who ever is being undermined	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__Attack	This article summarises it well  https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	Discriminatory words could be automatically blocked which will certainly reduce hate speech to some extent	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted

__label__Attack	However, it might also discourage people from leaving comments generally as it is quite difficult to leave a response and not many people would go through that much effort to say something, which there is a risk of being personally identified as well.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	I disagree, comments are how valid opinions are spread and change is made in the world. If there are no comments, there's no feedback.	ithink the best thing to do is to not have comments as that can really alter someone elses perception.

__label__Support	I agree in maybe censoring certain words but having moderators doesn't site well with me at all - it's getting to the point where only woke views are allowed to be expressed.	I think the best way is to block or censor certain words. Especially words that are synonymous with hate speech. Or better yet, have moderators in comments sections.
__label__Support	I agree with this as it is important to allow freedom of speech, however, not to the detriment of others.  There need to be acceptable guidelines.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

__label__Attack	when hate speech encourages violence or discrimination against any specific class of people it should be removed regardless of how inoffensive an particular individual might find it	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__Support	That is a great suggestion, that way, we all get to voice our opinions and the newspaper doesnt censor the views of their readers.	By moderating the comment section.

__label__Attack	I Disagree, modern software technology is capable of knowing when to filter out post being made by the public. A system can be integrated as too where if a  post achieves a certain threshold of flagged/reported tickets; there post would and can be immediately shut down.	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between  violent words from a comment.

__label__Support	That is a valid point , but completely removing the comment section is not the best solution for it	No , I think that would seriously limit freedom of speech 
__label__Attack	The drawback here is that people get carried away and be verbally aggressive and use foul language which doesn't go well with most of the readers who come to view the news and some of the healthy discussions in the comment section.

__label__Attack	hate speech can not be given opportunity to thrive and or be heard. it should be removed the moment it is made	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I don't agree with arguments that removing comment sections is an attack on free speech. People have multiple platforms where they can give their opinions (social media, emails, forums, conversations etc.). Newspapers aren't required to provide yet another place for people to converse.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Then what happens to those who cannot afford to buy new vehicles and what about all the oil producing companies and businesses that will be ruined?	While trying to sort. climate change, we cannot just shut the economy off, so yes we need cheap energy
__label__Attack	How do we coordinate different stakeholders'communications? At EU level, do you feel there are such spaces to enable regular and open commuinication? 	Accountability, straight answers and some kind of punishment for not upholding what they have said. 
__label__Attack	i dont think brexit is that bad considering the two year pandemic which certainly left a bigger issue on the country as a whole and brexit was voted by democracy the majority wanted brexit 	Agreed - in some situations, people choose not to work as they would be financially worse off. That needs changing.
__label__Support	Online would be a nicer place	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__Attack	"But there is a major difference between ""  white people should die"" and ""I have a dislike towards the white race are statistically more"	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__Attack	I think what you really mean, is that reflects your opinion.  	Lots of politicians are a bit out of touch with actual reality
__label__Attack	We will just end up importing oil and gas from other countries	yes but who do you trust to do that  -   tories are being dragged to the right to face off reform idiots and labour will have to get rid of left wing momentum 
__label__Attack	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__Attack	I agree with this. The trick is how to select unbiased moderators. They have to go by a guideline	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__Support	Extreme positions often have vested interests in maintaining polarization	Focus communication efforts on the middle ground rather than extreme positions
__label__Attack	Persons can become very insensitive and offensive in the opinions given, especially in the unmoderated comments forums.	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__Attack	there is always a need for opinions	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	They rob marginalized communities of their rights by being hateful, that doesn't get priority over the actual people facing violence as a result of their shitty actions.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	In the same way that society needs to fight hate, the Internet needs to fight online hate.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Scottish Independence has had its day. How can Scotland support itself?	Agree that climate change is a massive challenge and no parties are doing enough to combat it] 
__label__Attack	I disagree, try to read everyone's idea. Some are feasible and doable	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Agreed.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	yes, I agree, need moderators,	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Support	which area of the criminal justice system would you like to see a change in? 	We need a change of government but we don't have anything solid to change it with.  I thought the Americans had it bad but we are worse 
__label__Support	I agree - ban certain words	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__Support	i agree that we still need readers comments but they should be filtered.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I don't think this is appropriate if it is harmful to others.	allow people to say what they feel
__label__Support	I agree with all of this 	Hardly the most important issue just now
__label__Support	and help 1st time buyers in a way that doesn't just inflate the cost of homes and increase profits for building companies!	you should get a postal vote if you are not around on the day. it is a shame to waste your vote

__label__Attack	Education alone is not enough, people need to want to engage	International intervention is necessary to resolve the conflict
__label__Attack	it removes the right of freedom of speech	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__Attack	I don't think we will ever fully get rid of hate speech on these platforms unfortunately however more close monitoring could decrease it, as well as sanctions for those who write the hate speech.	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article:   https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__Support	It would be ok if there were enough jobs and houses for all of the immigrants but there are not.	consideration for disabled members of society
__label__Support	I agree. Children should be taught in schools the value to expressing their opinions but also the difference in expressing and opinion and spreading hate.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree with your opinion. I think trying to find ways to moderate the comments (either automatically or by a team of humans) would be a good step. Then it's also up to the responsability of the users themselves  to have a good attitude.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Yes, I think this is the right approach	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Free speech	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__Attack	I think they hold some responsibility. But perhaps not in the way this survey is trying to determine. A free flow of ideas is necessary, which includes difficult and often cantankerous and vigorous differing opinions. It should be the responsibility of said sites to allow those types of opinions, but deal with the trolls that free and open debate often attract.	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__Attack	'Free speech' does not mean the freedom to hurt others. It isn't a licence to offend and should definitely be regulated.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Which party you think would be best for that? 	Yes it was disgusting, surely no one can trust them after that!
__label__Support	Absolutely agree with this. Newspapers will moderate comments that do not agree with their agenda.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	i dont think is right	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588
__label__Support	https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/#	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__Support	No hate speech will be written	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Too much money is spent on mental health as it is 	Scottish Independence has had its day. How can Scotland support itself?
__label__Attack	I dont agree with this as sure it counters the hate speech but that makes me question the reliability of the news article	By educating people that not everything written in newspapers is true, they should egnore some information
__label__Support	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Attack	I have always voted, even when the only choice was between two bad candidates - women died for my right to vote!	Local businesses need a boost
__label__Support	no more hate speech	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	This is partially true, but fails to account for the fact that we couldn't possibly plant enough trees to absorb all of the CO2 produced. Not enough space on the Earth. And methane.	I think that growing more trees can reverse the adverse effects of manmade climate change. Trees release fresh oxygen. Protecting the environment is the key to reversing the harmful effects of climate change. It is most important to preserve the natural environment and plant more trees. Trees release oxygen which is very good for health.
__label__Support	accountability by inputting details is a good solution	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I think the whole concept of hate speech is nonsense and completely hypocritical.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__Attack	need to have a full time moderator	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	Newspapers are biased, therefore requires readers to fact-check and challenges their articles.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	people with positive comments won't be able to share	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	This is true but with the way the news is setup, giving your own idea can lead to heated arguments which can lead to hate speech	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	This closes the possibility of healthy debate and non-hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	this outs a limit on free speech	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__Attack	If we were more careful with who we allow in the country like Australia we may not be in the financial state we are in 	Our NHS is on it's knees due to the lack of immigrants.
__label__Attack	Despite this there is woefully little work done to date on behaviour change and mobilisation within diverse groups, specifically in relation to ethnicity and disability. Work on behaviour change by Defra and others rarely looks at diversity beyond traditional income and class segmentation. Defra’s Framework and Strategy for Environmental Behaviour Change reports of over 100 pages barely mention ethnicity and make no references to disability or age. 	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down. 
__label__Support	I like this becuase	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Attack	but it discredit the news paper	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	this is good idea but some words can have more than one meaning and be used it variety of different sentences. so maybe muting words that could be discrimatory could have its limitations. i.e if you mut the word gay ( this word then count be used it postive topics about gay rights marriages etc .	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__Support	I think this is a huge problem and it's not going to go away. Much of our political class is very out of touch, and doesn't seem to want to listen to the people (regardless of political persuasion - I know a lot of politically homeless people both left and right saying they don't feel represented or their concerns listened to). I think the big parties are very bureaucratic right now. 	I agree that's why I voted for Reform
__label__Attack	Even if it is moderated, who is to say that the moderator is unbiased and won't let some comments through even though they contain hate soeech	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__Support	totally agree with you there. Not sure how it's going to pan out 	None of leaders fill me with confidence, none of them feel like strong leaders who could 'grab the bull by it horns'
__label__Support	I hope you get it! Carer's work very hard and are underpaid :( 	Let immigrants work once they are here
__label__Attack	Lockdowns are not the answer to the problem. Look how the lockdowns for the virus have caused the economy to go downhill and the depression and bad effects on the people both socially and psychologically	Agree, bio-fuels is not a clean form of energy. Rich countries support it as a cheap form of energy, yet it has a high CO2 profile 
__label__Attack	May not address fundamental systemic issues	Start reforms at local government level first
__label__Support	Agreed, it's totally problematic once you start to censor opinion over simply bad language and obvious hate speech.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Attack	This removes balanced media consumption (people will get even more stuck in echo chambers!) and the idea of free-press means that there should be freedom to cross-examine	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section.

__label__Attack	but what if users arent using their real information, how can the goverment implement it then?	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__Attack	"The ""they are all the same' argument is out forward by the right to discourage Labour voters. "	We need a leader who can improve the economy and grow the NHS
__label__Attack	Yes, any views shoudl be substantiated and when its obvious that it serves an agenda it should be deleted	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__Attack	Moderators are useful but they will have their own bias and we cannot guarntee that they will be impartial, thus we remain in the same position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	yes but who do we have to run the country competently? 	The whole way this country is governed need a massive overhaul, there is too much corruption, too much conflict of interest regarding our MP's, we  live in a corrupt state even more than ever when are we going to say enough is enough?
__label__Attack	If the information was moderated & hidden if deemed to be hate speech then it would still exist for the purposes of feedback but not be visible within the comments section	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__Support	I do not understand comment sections in newspapers., I wish to read the story from the author; having a vox populi of people I don't know serves no purpose to me. I agree with this poster that there are (or could be) other areas where people can place their opinions -if anybody is really interested!	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	On the other hand it also eliminates the chance of reflections or beneficial  interactions within the audience	Yes it can avoid a lot of arguments and harrasments  
__label__Attack	I also agree this is a good solution	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	If a moderator removes a comment then they should have to justify why to the contributor who may be upset at their comment being removed.	I think it is ok to remove the comments. There are other places people can go to express opinions.
__label__Attack	In my opinion freedom of speech stops when it is directed hate towards a person or a group of people. Online platforms do not have to tolerate hate speech on their platforms.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Reader comments and opinions would be very beneficial towards newspapers as these comments could start meaningful conversations and introduce new perspective to the newspapers, and help readers be able to gain more understanding of topics by reading what other people think.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Allowing those to post it anonymously gives them the okay to do it over and over again without being called out over it.	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__Support	i agree with the comment about fake news, a lot of people reading online articles are vulnerable to taking information at face value without checking whether or not there is actual evidence for this	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	none of them to seem to be honest, it seems to be a trait missing in all our politicians 	tories can be such hypocrites let alone the extreme right, their effect has been devastating all over the globe!
__label__Support	This is maybe accurate if you were a conservative voter and are not sure what to vote for, but as a leftist, the reform party offers me nothing and I dont want them anywhere near our government 	They could offer safe routes to process immigrants, but they prefer to demonise immigrants.  
__label__Support	Completely agree with this point. Address the root cause of the problem might be difficult but hate speech should be avoided at all costs.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	As a moderator in other capacities, I can tell you it takes a lot of time to manually review every single comment as they come in.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	I agree with the statement, however in this article https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea they speak about different countries laws and UN laws. The difficulties in combatting hate speech on such a universal level is there is not a solid agreement from the world on what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	But why give space for extremist conservatism?  	It is very very concerning how so many people seem to have developed short-term memory loss (for the last 5 years) when it comes to the shameful, insulting, disrespectful actions of those who are in-charge of our well-being as a nation
__label__Attack	I believe we still can. We could live amore local life	Being vegan doesn't solve the collective issue of big farming and the drastic loss of biodiversity. Carbon footprint is not the singular way to measure sustainability.

So, although i know waiting lists must be a problem for certain patients, it's not for everyone and not top of my priority list 	Yes, I agree to some extent, but I don't think you'll ever find a party that completely mirrors your values, it's important to pick a party leader you feel has integrity and principles even if you don' t necessarily agree with everything they want to achieve
__label__Attack	would definitely need a team of moderators	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I leave below a link to the study I mentioned above but was not able to attach and I am curious to hear what is others opinion. https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__Support	Party Politics need to be abolished, and all politicians need to work toward one goal which is beneficial for all and not just oppose as they are the opposition. 	I agre Brexit is a disaster but no party is going to tackle that. A referendum on rejoining the sngle maRKET? a PRIATE MEMBERS BIL MIGHT DIO IT?
__label__Support	It has been suggested that hiding comments rather than removing them is the best way forward. Commenters don't like their posts to be deleted, understandably, and often feel censored which can cause them to lash out with further offensive comments. By hiding a comment, the original poster can still see it and may not realise that it has been hidden from others which minimises upset caused to others whilst preserving the original poster's involvement. https://blog.brandbastion.com/deleting-comments-can-trigger-backlash	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__Attack	I am not sure collecting data about the person before posting will help with tracing them down and trying to re-educate them.

__label__Attack	It would still need to be moderated as the users can radicalise themselves	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	it should target the insulting and violation to individual and groups right by law or common morality  
__label__Attack	This is what most social media companies already do.  Often the AI sensors the conversation based on the pre-selected criteria without the intervention of any human moderator, because there is too much traffic for humans to monitor.  This leads to a reduction in free-speech.	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__Support	Agreed, and already planned in our hpuse, where we'd usually vote Lib Dem, but will be voting labour as they are more likely to defeat the tories, although I suspect that in this constituency that this will be a futile attempt.  	I am sad to say that, following the information on the media, politicians seem to be less than 100% reliable.
__label__Support	I agree, not anywhere near enough new housing to cope with demand	"NHS reform is important, but needs more management (it's well below levels in comparable systems), more investment, and greater integration into the social care system. ""Efficiency"" is used to imply fewer managers and admin staff, which is the opposite of what is needed. We need to free up frontline staff from needing to manage and do admin."
__label__Support	Agreed, something needs to be done about this. It's hard to get into the housing market these days, even finding a proper rental can be hard.	I agree climate change is a massive issue that needs urgent and significant action, I'm not sure the UK on it's own can have much impact though 
__label__Support	good idea if the AI was reliable	I am proposing the use of AI to manage this space
__label__Support	Allows for testing and refinement of new approaches	Start reforms at local government level first
__label__Support	Yes, and moderators ensure that comments stick to this	maybe make the comment section questions and answers about the article so comments are stictley moderated
__label__Support	True I totally agree. I think having certain policies in place before being able to comment will help. Look at this article here. on policies for internet companies https://www.americanprogress.org/article/curbing-hate-online-companies-now/	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled

__label__Support	I agree, the fact that newspaper are not able to provide a fair and safe discussion space it is not a reason to reduce free speech	No, I believe it would mute/cancel the freedom-of-speech spirit that should be contained within journalism.
__label__Support	I disagree with this. Previous to social media and comment sections, newspapers often printed responses from readers. Journalists and those giving opinion pieces should face scrutiny and feedback from readers.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section.

__label__Support	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts.

__label__Support	Yes, it's disgraceful	I agree this is a pressing problem that hasn't received much coverage by the main parties
__label__Support	they can monetize the paper	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	that's right, comments actually can give a lot useful information but also give all the wrong idea about particular article.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	I agree. too  much damage has already been done to reverse the process and many people are unwilling to make changes to their lives that may be too much for their budget to handle	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Support	NHS needs total reform	it is not something i considered for voting tbh
__label__Attack	reflecting on this, and the use of AI - here is a statement from Facebook about monitoring hate speech and now allowing these comments on the platform: https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__Support	I have to say, this is my thoughts. I feel there is already too much of this going on, so the media oliagarchs can direct things politically.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	Indeed, because it is a tool made by human, it might have a creator bias	preferences for extreme ethical opinions 
__label__Support	Agreed, there's needs to be stronger consequences for those sharing hate speech. Those behind accounts which troll and leave horrific content should be banned and the ip address blocked.	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__Support	Persons would consider their thoughts more carefully.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Yes the costs are very high and most technologies in the [past have failed such as wind turbines etc which need electricity which cancels the effort	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Support	I agree, newspapers should remain impartial as much as possibe and outsource the management to a third party that most consumers of media can agree on to form that structure for defining and removing comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree, the Tory Gov has almost destroyed the NHS.  	Agreed. It must be ringfenced and protected like the triple lock on pensions with minimum guarantees

__label__Attack	I dont believe in censorship though. Commentary and opinions are important. We cannot say that just because some people might believe fake news we should only have one government authorized news source to protect people. People need to be less sensitive and also be aware enough to not take everything they read as being true.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	Is there a limit as to what hate speech is and what it isn't? Could someone write the rules to be overly enforcing and cause more issues and more hate?	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__Support	totally this is big	There's nothing wrong with not struggling
__label__Attack	The problem is establishing standards can be quite subjective and cause users to complain about censorship...	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Well said and well put argument here	I think I have decided who I will vote for
__label__Attack	But proper moderation is difficult to achieve.	Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.
__label__Attack	"I suppose the problem here is what a person says is their version of ""free speech"" could easily be seen in a different context by a reader.  It's a very difficult issue to get right."	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Moderation to reduce hate speech, objectively will be beneficial	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__Support	I agree. However, policies that educate people on how to deliver their speech is imperative	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__Attack	People may take advantage of this.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	Hiding them could be a good idea as it allows a log of this person, and could even allow possible banning of people from the platform if they use it in a bad way	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__Attack	"There are many scientist who refute the ""climate change scenario but are silenced and not allowed to speak their beliefs.

__label__Attack	This might negatively affect the person/ people in the articles.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Yes, freedom of speech is very important in this day and age.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	but if you were in charge what would your priority be?	i am not sure if this is recording what i say
__label__Support	Agree, think of CO2 emissions saved because of less caddle	I believe thats an accurate solution 
__label__Attack	The environment and immigration are just as important as the economy and the NHS. The latter two have more far reaching consequences than the first two in many respects 	we need a plan on how to improve the economy
__label__Support	I agree, this sounds like a sensible solution.	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__Support	Absolutely... and in all walks of life	Deliberative democracy will focus on co-creating new ideas with broad citizen engagement. 
__label__Support	I agree with this as it reflects my own view. Moderation is the way to go and not removal	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Agreed. And many of these potential solutions are also not successful at limiting harmful content (https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/the-facebook-upvote-and-downvote-experiment-is-a-bust.html). As long as the platform is comforming to the laws of the country then it should not have to introduce further measures to limit hate speech at the expense of preventing free and open discussion.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	This is a good idea, people might not even realize what can be classed as hateful if they've never experienced it before.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	we should be helping people to flee war torn countries rather than them risking their lives for hopes of survival 	reform the media. MSM should not be owned by foreign nationals. Make disinformation in the media an offence
__label__Support	I hope there will be prosecutions for the damage caused by the water companies due to greed, but I sadly, very much doubt there will be. 	I wish people would stop jumping on the bandwagon describing Reform as racists. Sure they have a few bad apples associated with them but have you taken the trouble to check out how many ethnic minority candidates they have standing
__label__Attack	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts!	Maybe. But all humanity should collectively act together with the lead of the big super powers. If USA and China stay out, I am afraid it would be useless
__label__Attack	This opens an avenue for hate speech to be supported by the fact that it falls under 'free speech'.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech and thought are both really important and allow people to sometimes 'clear' their minds of thoughts.	"I found this really interesting, ""Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend."" This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)"
__label__Attack	Then it would always be the medias word over the public	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	By eliminating readers comments, the readers will not be allowed to give their opinion on the topic, which infringes free-speech.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I think some people are out there to hurt so know they're commenting hateful things but know they can get away with it because there are no consequences.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	I agree, however the issue then becomes 'How do we go about finding the root cause '	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I disagree with this. I think taking away discussion completely also takes away healthy debate and positive conversation. There are ways to reduce hate comments, such as the ones outlined in this Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/04/09/10-tips-to-dealing-with-trolls/?sh=58ddf0f754f4.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Good idea as this may deter many who are considering posting hateful comments, although it may not deter the die-hards.	rules for discussion could be posted before giving the access, mention that chat moderators are following all discussions and hate speech will be removed if occures.

__label__Attack	I understand what you're saying in regard to rules and regulations, but people will still disregard it in order to state their opinion.

I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so              Dominicis wrong
__label__Attack	What is considered free speech (and should therefor be allowed) depends heavily on the location of the platform and the user. In the US free speech is protected by law to a much greater extend than in Europe.  In the US there are only a few categories of speech not protected by the First Amendment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions), like incitement to lawless action. In Europe however free speech stops there where it infringes on someone else their rights, for example the right to not be discriminated against. Racism and targeted hate for that reason is not protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) or the national laws of many of the European countries.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	people need to be nicer online	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.

__label__Support	I agree this article https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/ speaks about hthis also.

If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__Attack	working to engage those people described as disengaged or ‘hard-to-reach’ does not need to be a priority when so much else needs to be done as well. 	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.

__label__Support	yes cost of living important these days 	well, lets get this started. Cost of living, energy costs and the terrible state of the NHS
__label__Attack	If a man created a radio show, attacking the 'western' world, not actively engaging in war, terrorism or the sort, but speaking on it being a necessary evil... e.c.t. I for one would never call that and acceptable part of free spee ch and i know you wouldn't either	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	This would then stop freedom of speech	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	Speech cannot be violence in and of itself. What you are suggesting closes down public forums and debate, enhancing the impact of closed minded thinking and echo chambers in our society.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	are we listening?	hate speech is inevitable
__label__Attack	Newspapers should ensure comments are without any form of hate speech to encourage different opinions  to be shared.	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__Attack	Communication with consumers is challenging due to activist voices dominating the discourse	We need to improve communication to consumers about sustainable food choices
__label__Support	Always a question of who guards the guardians	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	This still poses an issue with what people think is acceptable.  You run the risk of people joining in as opposed to call it out.	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__Attack	"WHile the definition in general can apply to most types of hate speech, there is one flaw, which can be illustrated by the following statement: ""I don't care about your race, religion or gender. I do not like you because you are an idiot (or stupid)"". Is that hate speech or an expression of opinion?"	You can moderate and that way delete hate speech. This won't get rid of freedom of speech but gets rid of discrimination etc https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Attack	I agree that human moderators are necessary to reduce hate speech. However, I am concerned that not all websites may have the necessary financial and staffing resources to implement human moderation. I like that submitting personal information is necessary as a cost-effective means to reduce hate speech. However, I hope that the personal information will be verified, and the information will be used to promote change rather than to punish individuals. In this regard, laws may be necessary to protect online commentators.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Another con is this one	As by this planet every year human population increased by year by year. so that human needs also may increased. we have to find another solution for this climate change else we have to find alternate reusable energy sources like green gas, electric bike etc. this is the only way to protect our planet from this climate chagne
__label__Support	This statement was inspired and taken from Secretary General (https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/hate-speech-is-not-free-speech-says-secretary-general-ahead-of-human-rights-day)	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__Attack	Controversial topics should be decided on how sensitive the information or event would be to groups that are targeted with hate speech due to protected characteristics e.g race, religion, gender, sexuality etc.	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.
__label__Attack	eliminating the comment section is more like taking peoples freedoms away as people have the right to freedom of expression	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Using moderators and flagging can be abused to prevent valid comments. If the moderator doesn't like what you have written, or if there are several users who doesn't like you on the platform, they can abuse the flagging. Just look at YouTube and how many abuse the flagging to get rid of a channel or person who they don't agree with and who have strong opinions you don't agree with.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I agree with this, and don't have much confidence that it will change with a change of government. I feel that all of the manifestos either state something unrealistic or that I just don't believe 	There's a labour shortage right now and the adult social care system is heavily reliant on migrant labour. Migrants are also less likely to use the NHS and other public services than non-migrants 
__label__Support	Beneficial to the masses.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Attack	Many technologies like electric vehicles still plug into the grid and use fossil fuels. We do not have a zero emission grid yet.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	Yes, they deserve to be out.  But I fear you will get far more problems from Labour when they get their teeth into things.	The whole way this country is governed need a massive overhaul, there is too much corruption, too much conflict of interest regarding our MP's, we  live in a corrupt state even more than ever when are we going to say enough is enough?
__label__Support	The cost of living is a big factor. The existing government has failed to stop the profiteering by coorporations and private entities, especially in the energy sector. Lives are being devastated by profiteering.  	Healthcare is really important to me. I think the government have been using immigration to blame their poor governance, it gives them someone to blame.  
__label__Support	agreed. no one body/company should be given that much power. dialogue and transparency is the cornerstone of any democracy	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	so	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__Support	the numbers coming from the boats has increased and yet the govt telling us more are on the way if there is a change of govt. are they all not in the same parliament knowing all things? 	The basic honesty of the candidates and their integrity in actually giving direct answers to questions
__label__Support	The comment section should not be taken out instead, they should use software that is able to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__Attack	poorly worded I admit, I meant how those who have immeasurable amounts of money are able to get away without taxation while the rest of us are so harshly punished 	Corruption
__label__Attack	This is a great idea as people can openly speak their opinions without worry of being attacked.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	To reduce hateful speech on newspaper website, I think every newspaper must have their own admin, who monitors the comment posted and remove hateful speech and if an indvidual continue they must get blocked.
