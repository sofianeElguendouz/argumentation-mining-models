__label__Position	We need a national policy to set up community kitchens throughout the country
__label__Attack	Cooked food may get wasted in case of the wrong estimation of hungry people in the area.
__label__Support	India ranked 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index, 2021. Many people in India are undernourished and are sleeping on an empty stomach. As the supreme court mentioned, it is the duty of the welfare state to ensure that all the citizens have food to eat. By establishing community kitchens throughout the country, we can ensure that everyone has access to nutritious food.
__label__Support	Due to the pandemic, many people lost jobs, especially those who are working in the informal sector. So, now community kitchens are more needed than ever.
__label__Support	Tonnes of food grains rot every year at the Food Corporation of India (FCI). By supplying the food grains to the community kitchen, the waste of food grains can be prevented, and instead that can be used to feed hungry people.
__label__Support	Many people, especially youngsters are willing to volunteer. But not many have access to volunteer options nearby. Once community kitchens are set up, many people will happily volunteer and will donate supplies too.

__label__Position	We should fight crony capitalism in India
__label__Support	Crony capitalists are able to get away with just about anything. They enjoy the full support of money and the government in all their endeavors. Their decisions may even cause the economy to suffer adversely.
__label__Support	Crony capitalists get an advantage over their competitors due to support from the government. Simple examples of the undue advantage they get may be in the form of easier loan sanctions, loan approvals despite adverse credit ratings, easier land acquisition, out-of-turn property registration, tender approvals without any past record of performance, etc. This ruins the reward system of the markets. A monopoly gets established in the markets which prevents new players from entering the markets. This leads to lesser entrepreneurial activity in the country. Decreased entrepreneurial activity leads to lesser job opportunities and borrowing.
__label__Support	Crony capitalism has led to India having the world’s worst non-performing loan ratio. Lenders gave away loans to unworthy entities over the years despite knowing their credit backgrounds. The current amount of bad debts is approximately equal to INR 9 lakh crore and is expected to increase by INR 2 Trillion next year. The banks are left with no other option but to take huge haircuts (sometimes even as high as 65%) on the loans recovered. Taxpayers' money is often used to bail out these banks in order to save the economy.
__label__Support	An atmosphere of decreased lending is created and, in turn, the economy gets slowed down. As can be seen in India, entrepreneurial activity is extremely low. Job opportunities are extremely low today. India is experiencing the highest levels of unemployment in the last 4 decades. The Indian economy has been posting 7%+ GDP repeatedly but yet the common people are suffering while the rich are getting richer.

__label__Support	urbanization leads to a loss of small town identities, unsightly urban skyscrapers, and a mass increase of pollution.
__label__Attack	urbanization has everything nearby some those that can't travel far will have everything they need close to them
__label__Support	urbanization leaves rural communities impoverished. it should be stemmed so that rural areas continue to thrive and develop.
__label__Support	urbanization is bad for the enviornment
__label__Attack	urbanization can bring much needed money to a city.
__label__Support	urbanization destroys farmland and hinders the agricultural industry.
__label__Support	the countryside, which is threatened by urbanization, must be protected at all costs
__label__Support	increasing urbanization can have negative impacts on the natural enviroment
__label__Attack	there will be less sprawl when everyone is living in one area which will preserve a lot of natural ecosystems
__label__Support	urbanization increases pollution and congestion in cities.
__label__Attack	services and resources can be better managed in an urban setting.
__label__Attack	urbanization makes environmental sense as concentrated resources can be be used efficiently by more people.
__label__Support	we should fight urbanization because it causes more air pollution than there already is
__label__Attack	urban centers make it easier for people to find jobs and get around in a city where everything they need is close by.
__label__Attack	urbanization is more efficient and "green" due to a more organized and proximitous infrastructure.
__label__Attack	urbanization also creates job opportunities for many people as well as housing.

__label__Support	urbanization packs more people into smaller spaces causing more crime, pollution and diseases.
__label__Support	urbanization is the threat to our planet.
__label__Position	The EU should join NATO
__label__Position	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI
__label__Attack	Drones are being used in many industries. They go to places where it is difficult for humans to go. For example, they can be used to deliver medicines quickly in hilly regions. Drones can be used to deliver food in times of natural calamities. Not just delivering food, using drones, rescue teams can find people that are stuck and can save them. So, drones can save lives.
__label__Support	Drones can be misused to stalk, vandalize homes, and for doing many other anti-social activities. There have been many incidents, where drones posed security threats.
__label__Position	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__Attack	You owe the fact that you can drink your coffee in public to the people who got vaccinated and thus made the virus a little more manageable.
__label__Support	In addition to production and shipping, the score should also reflect the impact of the product's disposal. For example if the product requires to apply many different (toxic) chemicals for recycling, this should result in a worse score.
__label__Support	Yes, but the problem is: Just because a product can be recycled, it does not mean that it always will be recycled. Let's assume that there would be a really climate friendly way to recycle batteries. Still people could throw those into landfills. How does the score deal with this?
__label__Position	We should fight against urbanization
__label__Support	Urbanization results in increased population density, which leads to pressure on resources such as land, water, medical professionals, and police.
__label__Support	As more people keep coming to urban areas, there will be more supply of human resources than demand, hence the wages will decrease. Hence many people work so hard for a meager income.
__label__Support	More population causes a burden on the government and hence it will be difficult to ensure the quality of life for all.
__label__Support	Due to high demand, land prices, housing prices, and rents will increase drastically. Not everyone can afford the prices. Those who can afford to have to spend a large part of their income on housing. The people who cannot afford to rent in urban areas are forced to live in slums with substandard housing and poor sanitation facilities, which negatively affects the health of people living there.
__label__Position	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries
__label__Position	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India
__label__Support	NGOs are often America's way of interfering in European elections. NGOs must be policed more vigilantly to prevent America from interfering in our elections.
__label__Position	We should encourage people to take part in Fit India Movement
__label__Position	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__Position	We should subsidize student loans
__label__Position	We should make healthy food cheaper than unhealthy food
__label__Support	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.
__label__Position	We should have legal migration channels.
__label__Support	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.
__label__Support	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.
__label__Support	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights.
__label__Attack	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell.
__label__Attack	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.

__label__Support	No person should really earn an income from owning land itself, because it is not the result of human labor. Planet Earth is the common inheritance of humanity, why should any human have the right to take a piece of ground and demand payment from someone else for the privilege of using it? The land exists independently of the land owner.
__label__Support	A land tax would eliminate land speculation because the increase in ground rent would go away in tax.
__label__Attack	Space mining may be neat science fiction, but I doubt it could ever become a commercially feasible activity. Aside from the environmental impact of launching vehicles into space, moving the mined materials to Earth would pose its own challenges. Entry into the atmosphere and arrival on Earth is dangerous. Having thousands of tons of mined matter go through this process seems destined to end up with frequent disasters.
__label__Support	In the hope of becoming rich, many people are burning money to buy overhyped digital art. Many will lose money when people lose interest in buying these NFTs. Some people are saying that NFTs are a bubble that is going to burst.
__label__Attack	NFTs help artists sell their paintings, music, etc. for a good amount of money, which may not be possible before NFTs.
__label__Support	Whenever an NFT was sold or bought, the transaction consumes lots of electricity. This huge energy consumption is a serious issue because we are already fighting against climate change.
__label__Support	Hackers are stealing NFTs. And they are also stealing cryptocurrencies by sending malicious NFTs. Recently, hackers stole $150k worth of crypto from Twitch co-founder’s Fractal NFT project.
__label__Position	The EU leadership must enter into strong agreements with the countries where immigrants come from, in order to retain them in their countries
__label__Attack	Instead of banning anything, we should create better alternatives. When the high-speed rail line (320 km/h) between Strasbourg and Paris was opened, the number of flights between Stuttgart and Paris dropped dramatically, due to decreasing demand.
__label__Attack	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result.
__label__Attack	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.
__label__Support	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.

__label__Position	We should stop the development of autonomous cars
__label__Position	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__Support	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.
__label__Support	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research. This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic. These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.
__label__Position	Europe should have stronger borders
__label__Position	The EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey.
__label__Position	We should protect 20% of land in each European country to restore biodiversity
__label__Position	Rapists should be tortured
__label__Support	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.
__label__Support	Waste produces negative environmental impacts in the recipient state.
__label__Support	Exported trash is burning for months suffocating local people and wildlife.
__label__Support	Exported trash is often flushed to the sea by rain, thus polluting rivers on the go.
__label__Attack	Where do you think should be stored nuclear/radioactive waste please? Stored in glaciers will be problem (with melting etc.).
__label__Support	The broadcasting license on the European level can enable the creation of media champions that will be able to compete with media champions in other parts of the world (CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera...)
__label__Support	The broadcasting license on the European level can project European soft power beyond its borders.
__label__Support	The broadcasting license on the European level can help avoid misinformation, meddling, and foreign influence more than smaller networks, which would ensure a better quality of the content.
__label__Support	The broadcasting license on the European level will unite European markets for film and music.
__label__Support	A common broadcasting license would have an effect on the EU countries experiencing democratic backsliding
__label__Support	Children are made to work in industries with hazardous chemicals, and machines under harsh weather conditions, resulting in physical casualties and many severe diseases.
__label__Support	Due to a lack of education and proper guidance, they get influenced by criminals and take shortcuts to become rich, and end up committing crimes at a tender age. The rates of juvenile crime cases are increasing day by day in India.
__label__Support	The number of harassment and child abuse cases has drastically increased in the last few years most of them are sexual abuse cases occurring with girls and boys aged below 15.
__label__Support	Childhood is the most important phase for the development of physical and emotional abilities. The problem of child labor is stealing childhood from many children. Mere making laws to prevent it doesn’t solve the problem. Implementation of the laws on a war footing is needed.
__label__Position	We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users
__label__Position	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Attack	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive.
__label__Support	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years.
__label__Support	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.
__label__Attack	Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature. Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose. Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).
__label__Attack	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now.
__label__Position	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.
__label__Position	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness
__label__Position	We should end animal abuse
__label__Support	Feeding or dressing man is no longer an acceptable excuse with the state of knowledge of the “modern” world.
__label__Position	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.
__label__Support	There is little or no educational, conservational, research, or economic benefit derived from wild animals in traditional circuses that might justify their use and the loss of their ability to behave naturally as wild animals.
__label__Support	In circuses, wild animals in circuses are destined to a life of physical abuse and mental torture.
__label__Support	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts.
__label__Support	Circuses are traveling entertainment services moving around Europe, and performing wild animals are transported across Member States, where circuses pose a severe public safety threat.
__label__Attack	As women face violence because of their gender, they need special laws to protect them. But, in general, men do not face physical harassment just because of their gender.
__label__Attack	In India, it is very difficult for women to go to police stations to report crimes against them. Men’s commission may further deter them from approaching courts.
__label__Support	If a woman is a victim of any sort of harassment and is in a distress, society will more likely to help her. But the same is not true for men. If a man is a victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment, there is no single government entity he can approach to. Moreover, society may make fun of him for being weak. This is the reason married men are twice likely to commit suicide when compared to married women. To address these gender stereotypes and discrimination, there is a need for 'National commission for Men'.
__label__Support	As per the 2011 census, India has a 51.47% male population. India has a 'Ministry for women & child development', but none of the government entities is working on men’s rights. As India is a democratic country, it is unfair to neglect people based on their gender.
__label__Support	With better and more stringent mechanisms and laws in place to deal with sexual harassment, rape cases, and domestic violence cases, unfortunately, there have been instances of misuse of the laws to cause harm to innocent men. Setting up a Ministry of Men would at least give such men a chance to make their case. This, in no way, is meant to undermine the case for the protection of women.
__label__Support	It has been observed that in countries where the sex ratio is skewed against women, crimes against women increase drastically. As can be easily seen in India, crimes against women have been on the rise. Most horrific of all, crimes against minor girls have increased drastically since 2012. This paints a very grim picture of our society as a whole. The highest GDP growth rate amounts to nothing if our society itself is corrupted to the extent that it is right now. India has been a patriarchal society for centuries. To make a shift to an egalitarian society for women in every aspect of life, Indian men need to be re-educated and rehabilitated with the new norms.
__label__Support	Drug addiction is a menace that has plagued Indian youth in recent years. The majority of drug addicts are males. A ministry of men can help solve the problem of why capable male youth of the country are resorting to such self-destructive activities.

__label__Attack	Racial profiling is legal in certain cases, such as in cases of immigration.
__label__Attack	it is a fact that race, however distasteful this is, is often a predisposition to crime. we should work to change that but whilst it is a fact, must use that intelligence to protect the whole
__label__Support	there is no reason to use this ancient belief process, and we unfairly assign negative aspects to a group of people that do not deserve it.
__label__Support	racial profiling is indiscriminatory and it should end
__label__Attack	racial profiling is necessary to keep our country safe from its enemies.
__label__Support	we should end racial profiling because it is racist and doesn't actually do anything to lower crimes
__label__Support	racial profiling can be more misleading than accurate and can discriminate against minority groups
__label__Attack	there are certain races that commit certain crimes. it's just a fact. by allowing racial profiling you are allowing law enforcement to solve crimes faster than by assuming anyone could have done it.
__label__Support	racial profiling does nothing but permits law enforcement to commit legalized racism.
__label__Support	making a decision on race alone is pure racism
__label__Support	racial and ethnic discrimination occurs on a daily basis while preventing the progress of millions of people around the world
__label__Support	Racial profiling makes the people being profiled feel unsafe and afraid.
__label__Attack	racial profiling shouldn't be banned because it offers the potential of stopping a crime
__label__Support	racial profiling serves no purpose because you are stereotyping a population.
__label__Support	Racial profiling forces people into a life of crime by treating them like a criminal regardless of whether they have committed a crime.
__label__Support	racial profiling is an act of institutionalized racism and should be abolished right now
__label__Attack	Racial profiling helps law enforcement and Homeland Security recognize threats sooner and keep the country safer.
__label__Attack	having racial profiling is improving in countries statistic and nothing wrong with that.
__label__Attack	in certain situations, for example airports, racial profiling is necessary and effective for determining high risk members of the public, to ensure the safety of others
__label__Attack	racial profiling is one form of profiling and when combined with others is effective

__label__Attack	it is easier to find criminals if authorities can narrow down what ethnicity of person to look for along with other distinguishing features.
__label__Support	It is immoral to target a particular group based simply on their race of ethnicity.
__label__Attack	we shouldn't end racial profiling because it is a way to stop criminals before they commit crimes
__label__Support	racial profiling distracts law enforcement agencies from more useful approaches and it prevents police from serving the entire community and also prevents communities from working with the police.
__label__Attack	statistics show that crimes are committed by certain types of people, so law enforcement should target those people and watch them closer. it makes perfect sense.
__label__Support	we should not base suspicions on the color of skin, sex, religion. this is discrimination
__label__Attack	racial profiling is useful to monitor what is happening in society and so we should keep it.
__label__Support	racial profiling is discriminatory and humiliating and against one's constitutional rights.
__label__Support	we should definitely end racial profiling because every individual should be judged on their character alone.

__label__Support	racial profiling impigns the rights of the innocent.
__label__Position	We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir
__label__Support	As per Article 370, people of other regions cannot buy land or settle in Jammu & Kashmir. This is acting against the development of the region. By abolishing article 370, teachers, doctors, and other professionals can settle there bringing better facilities. And also industries can be set up in the region and hence Jammu & Kashmir can be economically developed.
__label__Support	By abolishing this article, the government can act tough against the terrorism present in the region.
__label__Support	Many laws such as The prohibition of the Child Marriage Act, and women’s reservations were not applicable to Jammu & Kashmir, because of the provisions of Article 370. All laws of India should also be applicable to J&K.
__label__Support	People of J&K have a feeling that settlers from other regions will change the demography of the region. So, due to the abolition of article 370, they may protest against the central government.
__label__Support	Citizens of Jammu & Kashmir are facing so much struggle because of many reasons such as the fight between India and Pakistan, the constant presence of troops, the unemployment crisis, etc. So if the special status is also removed, they may feel like their voice is suppressed.
__label__Attack	We were champions of hockey even when we were not independent. We have won Olympic 8 gold medals in Hockey, the highest in any sport. We had a glorious past, and we should work towards restoring it. Making cricket a national game may overshadow hockey.
__label__Support	Apart from the raw passion, the money and fame that follows are blinding. Unlike other players of other sports, the cricketers even at the junior levels earn handsomely, which is also a motivating factor that this game ensures financial security provided you play well.
__label__Support	India has been performing outstandingly well in cricket for the past 20 years or so. It is the most popular sport in India. Children are madly passionate about it, people are deeply involved in the game, and there is a cricket critic in every Indian house. The BCCI has been successful in brilliantly marketing and encouraging the game as well. BCCI is the richest cricket board in the world and the richest sports controlling authority in India. No sports authority has managed their game so well in India as compared to BCCI. We have won 3 World Cups, 2 Champion Trophies, and many more prestigious tournaments.
__label__Attack	Cricket basically originated in England and gained popularity in colonial countries as the English masters used to play. The fine Englishmen used to bat all day and the tiring bowling work was done by the locals of the colonies. This game is a sign of the presence of colonialism.

__label__Attack	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.
__label__Position	We should be aware of migration due to climate change
__label__Support	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!
__label__Support	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them. We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.

__label__Support	All of Europe has to pay income tax & VAT, except for the Eurocrats. In Belgium, you have to pay 50 % of your salary to the state, unless you work directly for the EU. Is this fair? No, of course not! It is time to make Europe fairer in a very practical and direct way, by abolishing tax exemptions for European politicians and staff.
__label__Support	It is absolutely ridiculous to be spending money on these climate disastrous practices. The EU is nowhere close to keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement and is still funding unsustainable practices left and right.
__label__Support	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model.
__label__Position	The Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept.
__label__Position	Consumerism brings more harm than good
__label__Position	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Attack	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.' The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.
__label__Position	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms
__label__Position	We should create a common constitution
__label__Attack	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions. We have the perfectly fine EU Treaties as the foundational documents of the EU. They must be followed to the letter.
__label__Position	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Support	Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress.
__label__Attack	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.
__label__Support	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.
__label__Support	Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again.
__label__Attack	We should focus more on human welfare. Currently, waste sorting and recycling are degrading human exploitation in sweatshops.
__label__Support	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels.
__label__Support	giving nuclear energy a green label will encourage the flow of financial resources across the EU toward environmentally sustainable activities
__label__Support	Nuclear energy can be considered sustainable because it is cheap and can be predicted for decades, and the price of power produced by nuclear power plants is not affected by changes in the price of natural gas or other energy carriers.
__label__Support	Nuclear energy use helps to avoid the release of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants every year, which contribute to the development of acid rain, smog, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.
__label__Position	Every human has the right to receive reliable information about the movement and distribution of public funds
__label__Position	We should abolish the three-strikes laws
__label__Position	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Attack	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps?
__label__Attack	If Europe is going to have concentration camps again, they should be in Europe, in plain sight, for everyone to see.
__label__Attack	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.
__label__Attack	Setting up inhumane camps by bribing local warlords is not the right way.
__label__Support	Agree. If the asylum seekers don't have to cross the Mediterranean to apply for it less of them will die trying and less human trafficking will take place.
__label__Support	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.
__label__Support	Good idea. These camps can be managed by the UN. The EU can send illegal immigrants to these camps. So they will not be on EU soil. From the camps they still can apply for asylum.
__label__Position	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Support	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop, With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today.
__label__Support	I highly support this. As Jonathan Foer puts it in his book 'We are the weather': Changing our diet will not suffice to save the planet, but we won't save it unless we eat differently.
__label__Attack	I understand your point and its importance, but as long as I have fangs in my mouth I will want to eat meat (like most people). You'd be better off suggesting more research into food printers.
__label__Support	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact.
__label__Support	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability. It only requires a person's higher capacity to be compassionate, respectful and most of all dedicated to our environment's needs. Who wouldn't want such qualities to become our society's norm?
__label__Support	Even if you believe you are unable to follow a plant-based lifestyle you must appreciate the effectiveness and dedication to the environment of those individuals who do.
__label__Support	There is no reason other than egotism to be against such a proposal.
__label__Position	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality

__label__Attack	The suggestion that men deserve payment for what has traditionally been women's unpaid work is problematic; it sends the message that only men's labor has value.
__label__Support	We should subsidize stay at home dads since it's so important for kids to have a father figure in their lives. Dads could be with their children and still have money to help live on.
__label__Support	stay at home dads allow mothers to have a career.
__label__Attack	it is their choice to stay at home rather than go to work so why should the tax payer pay for this?
__label__Attack	we should not subsidize stay-at-home dads since there are other more important issues that should be getting subsidized
__label__Support	we should subsidize stay-at-home dads because women usually don't make equal pay to the man so it would help make up the difference lacking in the wife's salary.
__label__Attack	staying at home is a choice since they know they won't be getting an income
__label__Support	dads who stay home provide a great asset in the raising of future generations of children. therefore, subsidies should be given to them to help them continue in their family endeavors.

__label__Attack	the state can not add to its cats a subsidy to unemployed parents because it would damage society by causing the family to stop working and dedicate themselves to procreate
__label__Attack	we cannot subsidize stay-at-home dads because there are numerous other issues that need funding like space exploration, health care, clean water, and feeding the world's hungry
__label__Attack	they have exactly nine months to prepare for it so any subsidizing in stay-at-home dads is just wrong.
__label__Support	subsidizing stay at home dads would help alleviate financial burdens on a lot of families
__label__Support	Stay at home dads do just as much work for taking care of the babies as stay at home moms and should be subsidized.
__label__Attack	stay at home dad's chose to be parents. no other citizen should pay to subsidize their lifestyle choice, especially the many citizens that have not had children of their own because they cannot afford to
__label__Attack	the state does not choose when parents try for children and it is the individual responsibility of the parents to make sensible choices that they can afford and it's not the state's place to fund their choices
__label__Attack	women have been staying home with children and have not been subsidized so men should be able to as well.
__label__Support	we should subsidize stay at home dads because they can take care of the home and family just like a woman can.

__label__Support	subsidizing stay at home dads would help a family financially and not put a burden on them

__label__Attack	we should not subsidize sate-at-home dads because it makes no since as it is law that women be paid equally as men, so there should not be a deficit in their income.
__label__Attack	we can't provide aide for everyone due to personal situations and stay at home dads are no exception.
__label__Attack	public funds can be used more effectively for needs that the entire population faces such as education, housing and the climate crisis.
__label__Attack	employers can't afford to do this its hard enough new mums have time off
__label__Support	the father, usually being the higher earner, needs to be subsidised to ensure there is enough income to support the family when there is only the mother's income which may well be considerably lower.
__label__Attack	men should be out in the workforce supporting their families.
__label__Support	stay at home dads provide a valuable service to their families and potentially future society. this contributions should be subsidized so more can do this
__label__Support	stay-at-home dads are often overlooked for their contribution to raising children so to help address this we should subsidize stay-at-home dads.

__label__Support	the subsidy could help lift families out of poverty

__label__Support	stay at home dads should be subsidized so that kids can be taken care of at home by a parent who is responsible for their well being.
__label__Attack	we should not because mothers should be with their children after they are born because they need to bond with them or studies show the child will not fully grow mentally.
__label__Attack	we should not subsidize stay-at-home dads as the government will struggle to afford this and it may lead to families with no parent in employment. a working parent ensures a strong role model and good values.

__label__Position	We should ban wild animals in circuses
__label__Support	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!
__label__Support	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!
__label__Support	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.
__label__Support	The residents get to have a community of their own. They can interact, make friends and enjoy themselves together.
__label__Support	Retirement homes are usually built in such a manner that injuries due to domestic accidents are minimized. Skid-proof tiles, arthritis-friendly fittings, etc are some of the features that they exhibit.

__label__Attack	The residents might be ill-treated by the authorities at the retirement homes.
__label__Position	We should protect bird habitats in built environments
__label__Position	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__Position	We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states
__label__Attack	'Fair' taxation is a vague concept. Taxes are complex and countries want to avoid double taxation. Countries should be able to set their own taxes in a way that matches their spending and the needs of their citizens. I am against global taxes and against double taxation.
__label__Support	Today we live in a system where our public healthcare system is organized on a for-profit healthcare system, where we develop knowledge through taxpayer institutions and then let companies patent this knowledge for profit this has to change, we shouldn't let the greed of capitalists extort us, the EU should work to DISMANTLE all patents and make healthcare issues for all. The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now.
__label__Attack	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this.
__label__Position	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate
__label__Support	Unfortunately, vaccination has shown that it is unable to curb the contagion and therefore the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the EU COVID digital certificate is not able to guarantee the safety for which it was designed, demonstrating that it is primarily a tool of discrimination without real usefulness in containing contagion
__label__Position	Gas and nuclear power should be supported with money from European countries
__label__Position	The EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe.
__label__Support	The technology-enabled economy of abundance without human exploitation you can endorse it. We should not hamper automation, instead, we should rethink morals about work. Let the robots do all the bad jobs and let human beings be free to pursue a creative and meaningful life
__label__Position	We should establish a European Army.
__label__Support	You should endorse the creation of the European Army to defend the interests of European countries, fight against trafficking (humans, drugs, etc.), and be used as the arm of genuine European diplomacy.
__label__Position	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__Attack	The rule of law varies from country to country, due to the fact that the concept developed in each country under the influence of local traditions. It's impossible, and superfluous to develop a uniform, EU-standard conception of the rule of law.
__label__Position	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency
__label__Support	Having all workers working in private enterprise, irrespective of size, share equity in the company they work for by default would motivate higher worker dedication, overall operating and productive efficiencies, improved quality, profit sharing, reduced corrupt practices in management through stricter accountability, work satisfaction - a win-win situation for all.
__label__Position	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform
__label__Attack	It would be a better idea to abolish the European Parliament. It has become an ideological Kabuki Theatre. The Commission should be entirely under the control of the sovereign member states, of course, who remain the masters of the treaties.
__label__Support	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council. We have seen this many times when the EU-MS have tried to find a common stance on foreign policy issues but one has been able to deter the will of all the other countries. This is not a democratic way. The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election.
__label__Support	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.

__label__Position	We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic
__label__Support	Microplastics are everywhere nowadays: in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. It is said that we consume a credit card's worth of plastics every week. This must stop before we consume an apple's worth of plastics every week.
__label__Support	Not many consumers are aware of how many of their products contain microplastics because producers deliberately hide this fact by only referring to the chemical names of microplastics on labels.
__label__Support	In order to in parallel raise consumer awareness about which products contain microplastics, the EU should introduce a requirement for mandatory labels on packages of products containing microplastics warning consumers of the presence thereof.
__label__Support	the solution must be a combination of EU regulation of microplastics, producers proactively replacing microplastics with natural elements with the same functions, and consumers making more informed choices to reduce demand from products with microplastics.

Moreover, bullet trains could prove to be an important means of transportation for long-duration journeys for the middle-class population of the country.

However, similar questions were raised during the introduction of telecom services and the commission of Maruti. As the service expanded and the demand increased, not only did the respective areas become profitable, but the prices also went down outrageously.

__label__Support	I think it is extremely important to upgrade our relations with the former Eastern European countries and in that way move us in the right direction. It is now they need us the most. The area around the Black Sea has enormous potential. They have a growth zone that moves from western Europe to the east and at the same time a growth zone that moves from south China to the north.

__label__Position	Betting and gambling should be legalized in India
__label__Support	Initially, India faced issues such as vaccine shortage, lack of availability of vaccines in remote places, etc. But now after solving all these challenges, the main challenge now is to vaccinate those who do not want to be vaccinated. So, by enforcing legal measures such as compulsory vaccination, we can achieve 100% vaccination. The government can help them in dealing with their fears by keeping them for a longer time in vaccination centers while having a medical team by their side.
__label__Support	If the world did not achieve 100% vaccination, a lot of new variants will be created. So, it is important to vaccinate all to reduce the possibility of new strains.
__label__Attack	Many people are not taking vaccination due to the rumors that are being spread by anti-vaxxers using social media. Taking action against these rumor creators is much better for improving the vaccination rate rather than enforcing compulsory vaccination.
__label__Attack	Widespread awareness campaigns involving local people can help in overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Innovative and creative advertisements can encourage people to take the vaccination. These methods will be much more effective than legal measures.

__label__Support	This way all EU countries have access to a single database which will reduce paperwork and registration and provide immediate and informed service without the risk of complications, especially in regard to medical history.
__label__Support	The EU Database should be made accessible for health studies and prevention in order to establish a European Basic Health care industry to overcome future pandemics.
__label__Attack	No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly. Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this.

__label__Attack	usa must have a detention center for criminals who attempt against national security and must be outside our territory

__label__Support	the guantanomo bay camp should be closed as people are kept there without fair trials
__label__Support	guantanamo bay detection camp should be closed because it allows inhumane treatment
__label__Attack	although sometimes considered a brutal place, suspected terrorists can be questioned somewhere they can't possibly escape from or be rescued from, potentially opening up new lines of investigation.
__label__Support	By violating the human rights of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. loses its authority to request from other countries to stop their human rights violations.
__label__Attack	we need guantanamo bay to deter terrorism and let them know we are serious about stopping it
__label__Support	it is costing taxpayers millions of dollars to keep it open.
__label__Attack	keeping suspected terrorists in a jail that close to american soil is frightening; they should be placed in a more desolate camp, further away from the country.

__label__Attack	guantanamo bay detection camp houses prisioners that it would not be safe to move
__label__Support	the torture in guantanamo bay are inhumane and awful. these people should be facing a judge and jury for their crimes. if you want info out of them give them less prison time. torture is not the answer.
__label__Support	there is no reason to have a prison in a foreign country. there is no reason to continue to place people in cuba some without even being charged. if this is needed have it in the us.
__label__Attack	the camp keeps prisoners separated from the rest of society and is therefore essential for the worst of prisoners.
__label__Support	Guantanamo Bay detention camp uses questionable tactics to get information from prisoners.
__label__Attack	it keeps all the dangerous criminals away from the society
__label__Attack	the camp should remain open and it keep society safe
__label__Support	its outdated and serves little purpose.
__label__Attack	the camp would be a good place for tours which could bring money in for the country.
__label__Attack	we cannot just release all of the prisoners to close the facility.
__label__Support	too many people have been imprisoned on guantanamo bay unfairly as they were subsequently released without charge.
__label__Attack	guantanamo bay has been useful in extracting information from enemy combatants and should not be closed.
__label__Attack	due to the multiple criticisms regarding torture, the guantanamo bay should not be closed but measures should be implemented for the reinsertion of the prisoners into society
__label__Attack	We should not close Guantanamo Bay detection camp as the prisoners there are still potentially dangerous to society.
__label__Support	prisoners are held at guantanamo bay camp without fair trial or representation, this camp violates human rights and must be closed as soon as possible.
__label__Attack	guantanamo bay detection camp offers an essential form of law enforcement and imprisonment for serious criminals and has provided important intelligence in ongoing surveillance.
__label__Support	prisoners are tortured beyond reasons there and it's a human right's violation
__label__Attack	it houses some very dangerous criminals who should not be allowed into the country
__label__Attack	Guantanamo can provide security for accused terrorists who would be hurt in the general prison population.
__label__Support	Imprisonment in Guantanamo is punishment without a trial, which is unconstitutional.
__label__Attack	it's a great place to keep terrorist suspects away from the general population keeping us all safer while they are under investigation.
__label__Position	Women are better managers than men
__label__Support	There has to be a general awareness that the real price of throw-away products and mass-produced foods is paid in the long run and that continuing down the current path will lead to more problems than having to adjust one's consumer behavior.
__label__Support	The idea of a circular economy could help us to tackle the problem of overconsumption and overproduction of waste.
__label__Support	such an approach to be successful must be implemented in each EU country to have visible results and help change the habits of both EU citizens and the private sector. And it has to be long-term promoted and funded. Can we do it?
__label__Support	Education is key. School curricula could help have more responsible consumption.
__label__Support	The national governments with the help of the EU should be able to set up “taxes” or “rewards” as in Sweden or Denmark to encourage citizens to recycle.
__label__Support	Print media is more trustworthy because once the news is published, it cannot be modified or deleted. Whereas in digital media, we can modify or delete the contents. So, those who run the newspapers and magazines will be extra careful while publishing the news or articles. Hence, print media is more trustworthy than digital media.
__label__Attack	It is not eco-friendly, since print media requires paper that is harvested from trees.
__label__Attack	Print media is just one-way communication. It gives information to the public, but consumers cannot share their opinions. Even though some newspapers publish readers’ mails, it is not user-friendly.
__label__Attack	Print media cannot target a specific audience, whereas digital media can show different ads to a different type of audience and thereby can generate more revenue.
__label__Support	Several online news websites are bringing their print versions to reach more consumers and establish credibility.
__label__Attack	Print media is not helpful for some people with disabilities, whereas digital media has accessibility options in general. For example, digital media helps people with visual impairment by providing audio versions of the content.
__label__Support	When we read newspapers, there will be no distractions and hence we can totally focus on it. This is an advantage of print media over digital media, which can distract us a lot with its various options and clickable advertisements.
__label__Support	These days, studies and work involve screen time for many. So, print media is like a break and relief. Moreover, at present more and more people are opting for Digital Detox time. Print media is super useful for them.
__label__Support	Following Print media can save a lot of time because all the content is compiled in a newspaper or magazine.
__label__Support	Still, some remote areas in India have limited access to the internet. Print media is a blessing for them to know the latest happenings around the world.

__label__Attack	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all! Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world. Radioactive rain - cool ;-)
__label__Position	We should subsidize hydrogen vehicles
__label__Position	We need a stand-alone European army.
__label__Attack	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.
__label__Support	Members should adopt measures to end unpaid Internships causes they are a form of exploitation of young people.
__label__Attack	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.
__label__Attack	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.
__label__Position	We should prohibit certain energy-intensive cryptocurrencies
__label__Position	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy

__label__Position	Electric cars are not a solution to air pollution
__label__Position	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.
__label__Position	We need a plan for receiving asylum/migrants.
__label__Attack	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it. We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control. I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic.
__label__Attack	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.
__label__Support	With the ongoing population explosion, in particular in Africa and the ME, the EU has no other option than a total ban on immigration. Exceptions can be made for temporary stays and for experts the EU needs.
__label__Support	The EU attempts to gain power over the EU members on the distribution of immigrants. It thereby cuts the rights of the EU members.
__label__Support	The EU is also weak in dealing with NGOs and in dealing with countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrants. Indeed, the EU cannot be trusted because of a lack of ambition or lack of competence.
__label__Support	The NGOs are committing the EXACT same crime Lukashenko is guilty of: Organizing mass migration and directing it toward Europe is aggression and an act of hybrid warfare.
__label__Position	US-Mexico border wall is a good thing
__label__Attack	It's an empty slogan that doesn't reflect the core principles and true nature of European integration. Member States and their peoples are the basis.
__label__Attack	The random radical constitutional foundation of the EU only riles hesitant populaces without solving a particular problem.
__label__Support	Less centralization in Brussels, more flexibility.
__label__Support	This is the only way that European values and democracies can survive the challenges ahead of us. Europe has two kinds of countries: small countries and small countries that haven't realised they are small yet. If we want to protect European sovereignty we need to keep integrating. The other option is to sell our countries to China and Russia or turn them into American colonies.
__label__Attack	No Federations, no centralization. We need to respect the European diversity.
__label__Support	A federal republic in which all European peoples can live according to their own way of life and identity. Yes, that would help!
__label__Support	We must recognize that in the face of climate change, a refugee crisis, a past financial crisis, and now a pandemic, it is no longer sufficiently well-welcomed to present the interests of Europeans
__label__Support	The individual member states are too weak to cope with the major challenges of our time.
__label__Attack	If the EU intends to survive it has to integrate less. Go back to the EEC. Instead of building a static bloc, it should increase competitiveness.
__label__Support	Lately, the EU has appeared weak and non-organized. For example, we have had no joint policy on how to handle the pandemic. Actions to deal with various problems often come too late. You cannot discuss solutions for years, which requires urgent action.
__label__Attack	Since the EU was developed, little progress and much stagnation have been made.
__label__Attack	The EURO has been a disaster. It has impoverished the EU and turned the EU into a fighting Union.
__label__Position	Migration should not be the solution.
__label__Position	We should prohibit the sale of washing machines without suitable filters
__label__Position	Foster care brings more harm than good
__label__Attack	Taking unilateral decisions is sometimes important because dialogue and all the other ways did not work till now.
__label__Attack	Bifurcation can result in better governance and more efficient administration. It can also help in tackling terrorism.
__label__Support	This may set as a bad example for the succeeding governments. Downgrading the status of a state to union territory can be taken as a precedent. For example, If the state government is ruled by a different party from the center, and if the center wants to take control of the state, this incident can be shown as an example to do so.
__label__Support	This step may be used by separatists to influence youngsters in acting against the Indian government.
__label__Attack	Moreover, tourism and film shootings faced obstacles due to the militancy in J&K. Now as Ladakh is a separate union territory, it can boost its economy.
__label__Support	Bifurcation of Jammu & Kashmir was done without consulting the people and local leaders of the state. Moreover, there was a blackout of communication channels and media, so they had no possibility of expressing their views. This sends a wrong message to the people and is against the democratic principles of India. It is also against the federal principles, which guarantees rights to states. Moreover, on the same day, Article 370 was revoked, so this may make local people feel like they have no say in the decisions that impact them.
__label__Support	Further division of Ladakh into 2 districts – Leh and Kargil on a religious basis is facing criticism from the local people. This move could have been avoided to preserve unity.
__label__Attack	When Jammu&Kashmir were one state, Ladakh felt alienated. Its ecological and cultural uniqueness was not given enough importance and was often neglected because the culture of Ladakh and J&K are very different. Thereby people of Ladakh are demanding bifurcation for a long time. Ladakh’s local leaders feel that their region was politically neglected by the administration at J&K. So, bifurcating is a good decision.
__label__Support	We need to protect citizen sovereignty against bad players (be it the state, private entities, or other individuals).
__label__Support	Facial recognition can and will be used against each of us by governments and corporations, based on who we are and what we look like. It will create societies of fear, anxiety, and suspicion.
__label__Support	Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest, and not to be discriminated against.
__label__Support	Europe should choose a common language. This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language.
__label__Position	We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender
__label__Attack	We have made huge strides in ending sex-based discrimination in Europe. I think we can say that - but for a few details - this issue has been resolved. 'Gender' is a political concept made out of whole cloth. One is certainly free to imagine oneself to be a pink unicorn, but in the eyes of the law and society, he or she remains a man or a woman.
__label__Position	Driverless cars should be allowed in India
__label__Attack	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.

__label__Support	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers.

__label__Support	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.
__label__Support	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.
