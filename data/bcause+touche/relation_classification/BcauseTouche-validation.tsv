__label__Support	Economies within a short distance, decentralization, and localization can be efficient tools for protecting the climate and the environment. Less transportation, consumption of local resources, and a high level of self-reliance in the energy and food sector lead to lower carbon footprints.	We should support short-distance economies
__label__Support	supporting short-distance economies can help kick off the development of localized small-scale economies.	We should support short-distance economies
__label__Support	What is edible, should be given to humans. What humans cannot eat, should be available for animals. What both cannot use, should go to biogas plants. The solid waste from biogas plants can be transformed into excellent compost. Runoff from biogas plants can be treated & provide H2. And the heat from biogas plants can provide heating or other forms of energy.	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain

__label__Support	In order to be able to fight cross-border crime, Europol should have the same jurisdiction as the FBI in the US. It should focus on domestic EU cross-border crime fighting. It should have the autonomy to act without the intervention of local or national political influence.	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI
__label__Attack	I think Europol should stay an association of regular National Police Departments and not be turned into anything else. However, I do support the creation of a European Criminal Investigations Office that will have full jurisdiction in the EU to investigate kidnappings and missing persons, cross-border and organized crime, terrorism threats, and digital crimes, and apprehend fugitives and suspects.	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI
__label__Attack	Fossil-sourced natural gas is as harmful as coal or oil. If it is sourced from fossil fuels, natural gas produces a net increase in CO2 in the atmosphere when burned.	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__Attack	Some biofuels, such as soy, corn, sugar cane, rapeseed, and palm oil encourage deforestation	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__Support	Refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course. When it comes to crimes, people are simply no longer worthy of protection and cannot be expelled because their actions show us that they neither accept nor respect our rules.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__Attack	All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified. Refugees/migrants are not to be expelled, certainly not immediately, but to be included in the employment problems and economic situation.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__Attack	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people. If we manage to be a welcoming continent, the people who come will thank us by being part of society.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__Support	A great idea because it definitely lowers the threshold.	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Support	It's high time that all broadcasting stations in the EU stimulate their journalists to cover European news as well.	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Support	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Support	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to integrate people with different backgrounds within the institutions.	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Support	The more language communication skills around the closer we can get in this complicated world we live in. The fact it is a popular language around the world but not really recognized in Europe should change. I fully endorse its recognition in Europe.	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__Support	Esperanto is a common language of citizens from all countries of the EU. Esperanto encounters bring them together for contact and understanding. The authorities of the European Union are called upon to support this direct communication of the citizens. It is our free choice in which language we want to talk to each other - please recognize and promote it!	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__Support	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__Support	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex).	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries
__label__Support	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries

__label__Attack	if you want to save birds, you perhaps should think about domesticated cats and making modern buildings more bird-friendly. If you want to save insects, look at the way of land use and agriculture, and create insect-friendly gardens.	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__Support	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	We should protect the European border
__label__Support	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.	We should protect the European border

__label__Attack	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__Attack	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__Support	All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__Support	If the European Council listened to the results of the inquiry made by the European Commission. 'The EU was set to stop changing its clocks in 2021, but then came Brexit, the pandemic, and some messy international bureaucracy'.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__Support	Compulsory military training can also make people stronger physically &amp; emotionally.	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India
__label__Attack	Most of the reserve force will not be utilized, which means huge amounts of expenditure on trainings will go in vain.	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India
__label__Attack	Some people do not have enough strength to participate in such intense trainings. They may seem normal from outside but may have mental illnesses. Military trainings can be emotionally and physically daunting for them. In such cases compulsory trainings will be a threat to their life.	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India
__label__Support	At present, most of the farmers in India are following chemical-based farming. But the food produced by excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can cause serious health problems when consumed. So, there is a need to address this, and Natural farming can be a solution to this.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Support	Even though organic farming produces healthy and nutritious food, it produces greenhouse gases and thereby contributes to climate change. So, the best alternative is ZBNF.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Support	With ZBNF, the government does not have to spend crores of rupees on loan waiver schemes.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Support	The third agricultural revolution, which is also called as ‘Green revolution resulted in the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Chemical-based farming results in soil health deterioration, heavy water usage for crops, and high input costs. Organic farming was started as a solution to this. But it requires large amounts of manure & vermicompost. So, organic farming is quite expensive. But the Zero-Budget Natural Farming approach will require very fewer input costs and restores soil health and produces highly nutritious food.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Attack	ZBNF is a cow-based farming practice. So ZBNF will result in an increase in the number of cows. But cows produce Methane, Nitrous Oxide & Ammonia, which are greenhouse gases and hence contribute to climate change. Methane is more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide, which is another greenhouse gas. Comparatively, methane is 25 times more powerful than Carbon dioxide. Nitrous Oxide is 300 more powerful than Carbon dioxide. And hence it is not a totally safe option.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Attack	The name – ‘Zero Budget Natural Farming’ is confusing. If anyone hears the name for the first time, he/she will think that this approach requires no investment. But it requires investment to spend on labor, cow maintenance, and water. The costs are very low when compared with other forms of agriculture, but it is not completely zero. To avoid this confusion, ZBNF was renamed as Subhash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF). But, it was announced as ZBNF in the budget 2019.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Support	We are witnessing farmer suicides in the past few years in several parts of the country. This is mainly because of the high input costs involved in farming. To raise capital, they are forced to take loans and if the crop fails due to various reasons, they are opting for suicide. Zero Budget Natural Farming will prevent farmers from getting trapped in a vicious cycle of debts.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Attack	In the 1960s, the Green revolution increased food grain production with the aim of achieving food security and preventing famines. At present India’s population is increasing. So we need an abundant food supply. This may not be possible if we completely switch to natural farming.	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India

__label__Support	To help achieve this, the EU should reduce its excessive livestock subsidies. An agricultural transition away from cattle towards plants would free up a lot of space	We should protect very large natural areas
__label__Support	Very large natural areas need to be protected to promote wildlife and the return of self-sustaining and fertile biodiversity!	We should protect very large natural areas
__label__Attack	Though the markets are yet a little controlled, they are freer than before. Consumerism improved the standard of living of the common Indian middle class tremendously. In recent decades, the Indian government has been improving the markets in order to boost entrepreneurial activity.	Consumerism brings more harm than good
__label__Attack	The middle class benefited tremendously from consumerism. Increased job opportunities, wages, and cheaper goods helped raise their living standards tremendously. The new world order gave them hope that even they could have luxuries like the elite. Through business, they could climb up the social ladder.	Consumerism brings more harm than good
__label__Attack	On the economic side, consumerism had a positive impact. Due to the increase in wages, people started buying more. Due to increased demand, aided by increased supply (due to the setting up of factories) entrepreneurial activity got a boost. Businesses were set up, jobs increased, wages improved and living standards improved. Overall, the world took a turn for the better. This made everyone look at consumerism (or for them, vanity) in a different light. Instead of being a stigma, it actually became a boon.	Consumerism brings more harm than good
__label__Attack	Many people are dying of hunger in India. Hunger and malnutrition are the biggest problems India is facing right now. Beef is a cheap protein available to poor people. With the cattle slaughter ban, the malnutrition problem worsens further.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Attack	70% of the cattle in India is owned by marginal farmers. They cannot afford to maintain their cattle after the cattle stop providing benefits to farmers, like providing milk, dung, etc. The only way for farmers is to sell these old animals to slaughterhouses.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Support	The cow is a sacred animal for Hindus. Killing cows hurts their sentiments.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Attack	It is not ethical to interfere with the food habits of others.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Support	It is our responsibility to stop cruelty against animals. Article 48 of the Indian constitution mentions that the state should take steps in prohibiting the slaughter of cattle. Many slaughterhouses are still not following the rules to not harass the animals while killing. Animals are subjected to intense suffering at most slaughterhouses.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Attack	Taking action against illegal slaughterhouses is the right step, but banning entire cattle slaughter may not be the right decision by the central government. There are food security and livelihood security issues. It is the responsibility of the government to respect everyone’s choices equally.	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Support	Subsidies for meat production and fishery not only have a negative impact on our environment - but they also destroy the economy in poorer countries in Africa! We really should find a way to stop these and get out of this vicious circle!	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries
__label__Attack	This can be a threat to privacy because this linking can lead to the profiling of voters. Several states collected caste, religion, and other sensitive information as part of aadhaar data collection. So, this can be misused by some politicians to selectively eliminate some voters based on their caste or any other identity.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Attack	If legitimate voters do not have an aadhaar or if they could not link it due to any reason, they will be removed from the list. For example, some homeless people do not have aadhaar cards yet. In the 2018 Telangana Assembly elections, linking aadhaar cards with Voter ID led to the elimination of 20 lakh voters.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Attack	There are fake and duplicate aadhaar cards too. So, linking aadhaar cards with voter IDs may complicate the issue.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Support	This can be used to eliminate fake voter cards. Moreover, some people have voter cards in 2 or more areas. These duplicate voter cards can be eliminated by linking Aadhaar cards with Voter IDs.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Support	This linking can clear the path to internet voting or e-voting.	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Attack	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.	We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage
__label__Support	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime!	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__Support	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__Support	European institutions should take factual studies of the relative harm of different drugs into account. A UK study has shown that drugs such as cannabis and many hallucinogenic drugs are far less harmful than alcohol. The study in question was conducted by David J Nutt, Leslie A King, Lawrence D Phillips, on behalf of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__Attack	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality
__label__Attack	In the case of nuclear power, cooling is needed to prevent a meltdown. And if water is not available because of drought or freezing, earthquake or tsunami, etc, these gigantic steam engines have to be shut down, otherwise, they will produce highly hazardous outcomes.	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy
__label__Attack	If you want to do it for nuclear power, then it would be better to do it for every single kind of energy production methods. It’s also important then to include the complete cycle of all the energies, the human cost, the extraction of primary resources, in the case of renewable energy, take into account the necessary energy storage, and so on and so forth.	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__Support	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. They are internationally recognized & very precise.

The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details.	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable
__label__Support	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.

__label__Support	Currently the ETS only applies to certain carbon-emitting industries covering 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. To effectively combat climate change 40% is not enough. That is why the ETS has to be expanded to at least cover agriculture and transport as well. In Addition to the extension of the ETS the subsidies in fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) must be cut in the near future.	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)

We should not forget about indigenous Europeans

However, Brussels is causing problems by telling the whole World that everyone (7 billion people) has the right to apply for asylum in the EU.

__label__Support	Experts have been discussing that the two major threats in front of us are Climate Change and Nuclear Weapons. And they have been urging for complete disarmament. To some extent they are right. When a nuclear bomb will explode the surface will become hotter than the sun and apart from the mass destruction and deaths, the generations of people and animals who survive will perish for many decades. Reports say that almost 2000 nuclear weapons are kept on high alert throughout the year. Any misunderstanding or miscommunication can lead to a disaster, and with the impulsive leadership we are seeing around the world possibilities are higher than before. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the symbolic Doomsday Clock by 30 seconds in February, which indicates how world leaders are failing in maintaining peace.	Nuclear disarmament is necessary

__label__Attack	Nuclear weapons are extremely lethal and can wipe out life on the Earth, and have actually worked as a deterrence to full-scale wars. We have seen two world wars, and the second one came to an end with a nuclear bomb being dropped by the USA on Japan. Since then, we haven’t seen any open, full-fledged wars, not because there have been no tensions among the countries and we all are living happily, but because of the reason that most of the developed and developing countries have nuclear arms.	Nuclear disarmament is necessary
__label__Attack	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters

__label__Attack	The age of 18 years is considered a legal adult in India. They have voting rights too. But not giving them the right to marry the partner of their choice may work against their rights. In 2018, the Law Commission recommended lowering the minimum legal age of men from 21 to 18 years and suggested keeping both genders’ minimum legal age for marriage as 18 years.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Support	At present, many girls are forced to drop out of studies for marriage. So, making the minimum legal age for marriage 21 will allow them to continue their studies. Thereby, many more women will go for higher education.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Support	Teenage pregnancies increase the risk of high blood pressure, anemia, and several other health problems. It can also lead to the death of the mother due to pregnancy complications. So, raising the age of marriage for girls can reduce the chance of maternal mortality.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Support	Early marriages result in several mental health issues in many girls. So, this move can eliminate this problem.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Support	As several girls are married at 18 years, they are not having financial independence. This is resulting in dependence on their husbands for survival. The dependence will force them to stay in the relationship even if it is abusive. So, raising the minimum legal age for marriage can empower women and can help them in achieving financial independence before marriage.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Attack	As per the government data of 2017, the average age of marriage for women is increased to 22.1 years. So, the change is voluntary. The change was mainly due to the improving education among women. So, the solution lies in encouraging education for girls, conducting awareness programs on the importance of education, financial independence and the consequences of teenage pregnancies should be conducted instead of passing a law to bring a real change in society.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Attack	At present, child marriages are happening throughout India even after ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, of 2006’. As per the National Family Health Survey (2019-2021), 1/4th of the women aged 20-24 years were married before attaining the age of 18 years. After the pandemic, the number of child marriages increased significantly. So, the problem lies in the implementation. Hence the law alone cannot bring a change in society without proper implementation. Root causes should be addressed before bringing a law.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Attack	Several girls are being forced into marriages due to the patriarchal mindset of their families. Until now, many girls of such families rebelled against such forced marriages and married the person of their choice after attaining 18 years with the help of legal support. But now, they have to wait till attaining 21 years. This will be misused by patriarchal families to threaten and control them.

__label__Support	The European Parliament is in dire need of reform. It has become a circus, where the MEPs engage in wild ideological posturing without substance. The EP's function is to address the pressing needs of EU citizens, but it hasn't done that for ages. One possible solution could be to replace it with a legislative body that is made up of delegates from member state parliaments.	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making
__label__Support	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution.

__label__Support	Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are by far the most important neighbors of the EU. A good relationship with all three is very desirable for the EU. For that, we would have to be willing to understand their history better.	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Support	The Russian Federation is our neighbor. We share common historic and cultural ties with them. Today the EU confronts Russia with sanctions. An understandable reaction to its actions in Ukraine and failing democracy. Let us not forget actions done by others (US intervention in Iraq, the Chinese in Tibet and their treatment of minorities, etc.). Yet we close our eyes.	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Support	Russia is troublesome with its own agenda and unconventional methods. Perhaps due to a heritage of a system, that is no longer the norm today. Remember, they fought next to us and Russians merit our hand reaching out to them. A policy change to show empathy, foster closer economic ties, and build on bilateral projects and partnerships in various cultural, scientific, trade, or economic programs.	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Support	Including Russia in our sphere of friendship would allow the EU to discuss certain values from within and coax them toward democracy and change. Economic partnerships can act as leverage. Friendly ties, in time, will bring common views to prevail.	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Support	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.).	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Support	Many people, even in the richest European countries, work hard, work overtime or have several jobs & cannot sustain themselves. That's humiliating, time-consuming alien to physical & mental health, and poisoning society.	We should make living wages a human right

__label__Support	I agree that removing the comments section is not a solution to stopping hate speech as this just encourages users to go to different platforms, users need to be able to post their opinions but newspapers should have a responsibility to monitor what is being posted as well as a responsibility on the tone of articles they post online as this can have an effect on the type of comments that users leave as some users will see an article and the tone of the article will make them respond in a controversial way which encourages hate speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	I feel they do have a responsibility to monitor trolling and abusive behaviour as this can be harmful to others. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.

__label__Attack	its hard to find moderators without bias	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	To read a persons message would be an invasion of privacy	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.

__label__Attack	By total scrapping of the comment section, reporters might get away with misinforming the public therefore they need to be called out right on the spot but in a respectful manner.	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__Attack	Yes however, it would at least stop the effect hate speech has on others	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Attack	Who deems whether criticism is valid or invalid in this situation? I guess there will always be conflicting opinions and ideas, but over policing of this may not be the solution to managing hate speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Even if someone provides their personal details many people are still not deterred from commenting hate speech proof of this is that in Facebook where most people have their personal information they still comment hate speech in the comments on posts	We need people to supply their personal details in order to limit hate speech

__label__Support	I do agree. I do believe there is some impact on climate due to man's activity but this has been studied over such a short term that I am skeptical of any hard and definite conclusion.	Government should impose some rules on the people to protect the environment . It may say every one must use electric vehicles, every home must have minimum no of trees grown to counteract the man made damage

__label__Support	Leave the ECHR	The current system of voting does have its issues. But there is still value in voting. 
__label__Attack	If people aren’t made aware of issues relating to hate speech, there may not be enough awareness to create a change	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group
__label__Attack	It could lead to technical mistakes barring genuine contribution	The use of a system that detect hate speech before publishing
__label__Support	I feel like this would be the mos t ideal solution.	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments. If a certain post contain such words, it should not be automatically exposed to other readers but should be reviewed first by the admin to check if it meets the standard before being exposed to everyone.
__label__Attack	People wont be able to express themselves	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	Absolutely agree with you;removing the comments section will achieve nothing  as it will drown out even sound contributions to the discussion(s).	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Unfortunately people will always exist that are hateful	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__Attack	they wont be taking a lead unless they allie themselves so only relevant where they are surely	Better foresight could help prepare for crises
__label__Attack	I think it would take more than one person in many cases and have heard that professional moderators have to have appropriate support and training due to the nature of items that can be posted to such sites.	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net. This would make more work for the newspapers but would only require one person to constantly monitor what is being submitted and only allow reasonable comments.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Support	"""Townscape ('amenity') and heritage concerns"" (Crispin Edwards)"	"""Planning barriers in retrofitting"" (Crispin Edwards)"
__label__Attack	I overall agree. But, newspaper comment sections are very public and mainstream. Allowing hate speech on such places makes it seem less taboo, and more allowed. These aren't the kinds of ideas we want people to think are 'ok'.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__Attack	hate speech is discrimination, but people should be free to express themselves on websites because not every comment will be hate speech and other people inspire other from comments, without the comment space people will be unable to interact online.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	We live in a democratic country and so, everyone is entitled to their opinion.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	I'm afraid there will always people who will be offensive against others	I believe some sort of regulation in media will always be necessary to decrease the damage hate speech might cause -- comments space included. We still need to get to the bottom of the issue, though.
__label__Attack	honestly, what do you think you are adding to the discourse?	I do think that Covid hugely affected the NHS and this would be difficult for the government to fix overnight (in addition to the funding crisis). 
__label__Attack	Technology can help. Planting trees can also help but isn't the single solution. We need to simultaneously adopt many strategies and methods to fight climate change. 	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Attack	I think you are right to some degree Fabio. However wouldn't moderating some of the comments mean that we don't get an overall view of people's real views on a topic? Even if they are hateful?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Agree rich should be taxed more. Council tax needs reform 	Inequality yes- but regarding what exactly?
__label__Support	This could be done through public opinion, such as what the general public would consider less restricted and what is acceptable in current society.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	Yep.  This is the biggest issue in British politics still but it'll not be discussed 	We need people in the UK to actually be helped back into work to realise they can earn more money by working than on benefits. There are enough people to make a difference without so many immigrants.
__label__Attack	Critical discussions are essential to democratic nations	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__Attack	because no	seems to me to describe management as much as leadership and too generic and not HE specific.......
__label__Attack	We need rules and governance as a society. We don't always have to say what we think especially when it constitutes hate speech. You can argue respectfully.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	The problem is that hate speech can esculate and end up working against the newspaper's interest. People don't want to spend time in a fully toxic environment.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I completely agree, it will help avoid people posting offensive comments and allow the comment section space to be a space of productiveness where we learn what our fellow communities think about articles posted	I think newspapers websites should have an online system  that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.
__label__Attack	higher probably if they're scrounging on prolific all day... 	Scotland is desperate for immigrants. Our NHS is suffering because of the lack of immigration.
__label__Support	what does that even mean??	NHS, political representation, standards in public life, position on women's rights
__label__Attack	I do agree with you, but I think the people also should have a way of reporting comments.	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I disagree. Removing the comments section is limiting access to echo chambers, quite literally.	The vast majority of digital news consumers - that is 76% in America, read comments sections. This means by removing them were missing a big chance at limiting the harmful effects of echo chambers and encouraging consumers to think critically and question things
__label__Support	Are you voting for less immigration or a different methodology of how we currently do it?	we need a plan on how to improve the economy
__label__Attack	something needs to be done about 'hate speech' so moderators would be a good idea,	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Algorithm not always working	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	This would set the tone on the level of maturity that is required for the targeted group.	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__Support	everyone has the right to share their opinions, however online comments make it too easy for hate and discrimination to be spread with out consequences. There needs to be a way to stop the hate spreading but also still give people the oppertunity to express their comments so i think this is a good idea	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I agree-having recently been in hospital, I was shocked and saddened by the state of the NHS	Hardly the most important issue just now
__label__Support	It all seemed to get swept under the carpet.  The number of people that died in this country due to covid was disgraceful and the government should have paid for how they behaved	How can trans rights (bio men) be more important than bio females when talking about womens rights? birthing people? chest feeders? bonus hole? bloody ridiculous
__label__Support	Couldnt agree more as a minimum wage worker 	I just returned from a Commonwealth country - where I received fantastic healthcare. Why can't UK do the same with so much more money and infrastructure?

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I completely disagree with the notion of not voting as a form of protest, you can choose a strategic vote, where we align with a particular party's policies, just to balance out the representation, and allow some voice of reason to be able to speak-up	Close the tax loop holes and put more resource into tackling tax avoidance/evasion

__label__Attack	Individual currators personal bias	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__Attack	agree to some extent but it removes accountability from the journal itself.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	It does feel like you can't be proud to be British without being apologetic. Weird really. 	too few houses built over the last 30 years and when immigration is the size of birmingham every 2 years
__label__Attack	Is there any evidence to suggest people prefer the comments?	online newspaper will definately attract a lot of people if there is comment section as some people prefer to go through comments first to get insight of the content.
__label__Attack	Not allowing hateful comment does not mean we limit people freedom of speech but promote kindness.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.
__label__Support	totally agree , weve had a selfish government for too long	lets stop the madness of climate change restrictions.. I love my DIESEL engine :) 
__label__Attack	We are already seeing the effects of Brexit take a negative toll on our farming and food industry. It has been nothing but a disaster.	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!

__label__Attack	so less money for the services that need it? I say higher taxes and more investment in services 	It is unfair to say you don't trust parties that have had no chance to prove themselves. The tories alone have been in charge for 14 years. Any of the other parties could offer more, its certainly worth a gamble at this point 
__label__Support	I agree that removing anonymity online can help to moderate behaviour. With anonymity online users lose their inhibitions and can be more extreme as shown in this article https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noam-Lapidot-Lefler/publication/220495001_Effects_of_anonymity_invisibility_and_lack_of_eye-contact_on_toxic_online_disinhibition/links/5f9590ce92851c14bce5ae0c/Effects-of-anonymity-invisibility-and-lack-of-eye-contact-on-toxic-online-disinhibition.pdf	The power of newspapers is too strong and needs to be restricted , moderation of the comments section is needed linked with non anonymous posting of mcomments
__label__Support	I agree, public debate is good.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	"It's not about how much people are earning... it""s about how much living cost... You can earn 1Euro and hour if the housing costs, food etc compares to that wage.  You can earn 13euros per hour if the nursery cost is exactly the same per month than what you earn... or that you can't phisically be alone, without a partner and have your own accommodation as simply almost impossible to pay.  Just because other countries have it worst, it doesnt mean the situation here is not bad. "	100% too many living off the state, have no reason to go back to work 
__label__Attack	I have seen this method used online before, but it does tend to hinder discussion with fellow readers.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	But public opinion would be silenced, which is bad for democracy.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	getting everyone sat around and stopping the strikes would be most helpful for the NHS	Agreed - we have a credibility issue on the world stage - too many political embarrassments back to back 
__label__Attack	But too much freedom creates all the hate and toxicity we see in today's media	No , I think that would seriously limit freedom of speech 
__label__Attack	"How much hate speech is there really on newspaper comments sections? Usually a difference of opinion is enough for some people to lurch for the ""hate speech"" card in order to get a comment removed because they don't like a different viewpoint."	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__Attack	Readers comments are an accountability tool for curation	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments for future moderated review :-)	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	While I agree that it is free speech, just because it's free speech shouldn't mean it should be allowed especially when its there for everyone to see.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I think this is a bad idea. The comments section is an important means of debunking biased articles or potentially gaining a different perspective on what others think about what you've just read.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	No need to keep on - just do the process properly - were out its done 	We need people in the UK to actually be helped back into work to realise they can earn more money by working than on benefits. There are enough people to make a difference without so many immigrants.
__label__Attack	"Someone's belief that a marginalised group doesn't deserve rights is far different from having a different opinion on something like the ending of a loved TV show. It should not be the responsibility of those hurt from harmful rhetoric to ""be the bigger person"" and ignore it when it has been proven that hate speech leads to acts of extreme violence"	People should be allowed to say what they want. Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__Support	agree. It does need a revamp but that doesn't mean it needs to be privatised	For me its the cost of living crisis, State of the NHS
__label__Attack	look into all that gas cars require before you are so quick to promote them.	Countries need not to spend much for this. It must initiate some compulsory programs and stop producing vehicles that depends on petrol etc
__label__Support	no way should we be privatising the nhs 	Agree, need a fairer distribution of resources. But are Labour bold enough to tackle this? 
__label__Support	it needs completely re-structuring from the top, throwing more money at everything isn't always the answer when its poorly managed 	"Yes most of them are career politicians and never had a ""real"" job outside of politics "
__label__Support	because yes	seems to me to describe management as much as leadership and too generic and not HE specific.......
__label__Attack	getting rid of comment sections reduces the change for openness towards the topic, you cannot educate people you can't reach	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	With every right comes responsibly so your right cannot impose on others	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__Attack	There are plenty of brownfield land, I don't know why we can't build on that 	Trust in politics
__label__Support	I find it very helpful when the comments includes updates or links to a more current news story	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.

__label__Support	"I agree. Some for of moderation is needed. Users should have to agree to some sort of ""anti hate speech"" policy when signing up and accounts who violate the policy (by posting hate speech) should be banned. The moderation can be done similarly to how social media platforms such as Instagram allows users to filter out certain keywords from their comment section and any comments with those words do not appear in the comment section as seen here  ( https://help.instagram.com/700284123459336 )"	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__Support	Cost of living is a key concern for me, too. Both directly, and because it impacts on other areas such as negative perceptions of immigration	treating refugees with more compassion 
__label__Attack	Reducing freedom of speech is never good and using an algorithm can be helpful, however it opens a whole group of structural problems, when not all hate speech is treated equally. https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Support	agreed, it is an important issue 	I think it's terrible for young people with families who have to pay rent or mortgages as well as feed and care for their children.
__label__Attack	Eliminating the space for reader comments would be violating free speech, in my opinion it would be much better to have every incident recorded as a Non-crime hate incident'. The government needs to have stricter and clearer laws on what entails hate crime and hate incidents.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	What you are suggesting means that free speech should be limited to those articles that won't generate a conversation.  If you look at  https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/news-sites-that-turn-off-commenting-dont-drive-users-to-social-media-instead/ it shows that restricting or reducing comments can inflame a situation and cause irrational and trolling.	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__Support	Spot on.	it is not something i considered for voting tbh
__label__Attack	have to be careful with banned lists, sometimes they dont do what theyre meant to	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this.

__label__Attack	I totally disagree with this because this sounds like a violation of of the human right to freedom of speech. Also, this means that newspapers will be able to get away with publishing articles that the general public does not agree with without any repercussions.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I think it's difficult to re-educate (so to speak) someone engaging in Hate Speech because the root cause is something within themselves. Unless a newspaper website wanted to fund a dedicated team to address and re-program the life long beliefs and internalised trauma that some racists, homophobes etc hold, then it seems an insurmountable task. The key would be to start at the ground floor and provide affordable therapy, mandatory counselling for offenders, pump more money into diversifying and fortifying the education system...	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Yes RayC. You have a good point there. Hate speech is totally unnecessary - words can HURT!	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	Recent congressional hearings have highlighted the chasm between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler convened a hearing in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, saying the internet has aided white nationalism’s international proliferation. “The President’s rhetoric fans the flames with language that—whether intentional or not—may motivate and embolden white supremacist movements,” he said, a charge Republicans on the panel disputed. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Ted Cruz, held a nearly simultaneous hearing in which he alleged that major social media companies’ rules disproportionately censor conservative speech, threatening the platforms with federal regulation. Democrats on that panel said Republicans seek to weaken policies dealing with hate speech and disinformation that instead ought to be strengthened.	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__Attack	The same technology that allows social media to galvanise democratic activists can be used by hate groups seeking to organise and recruit. It also allows fringe sites, including peddlers of conspiracies, to reach audiences far broader than their core readership. Online platforms’ business models depend on maximising reading or viewing times. Since Facebook and similar platforms make their money by enabling advertisers to target audiences with extreme precision, it is in their interests to let people find the communities where they will spend the most time.https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	Newspapers in print have a comments section that you can write in to give your opinions on, but the replies are moderated and checked.  Online versions should have the same ability, differences of opinion should be embraced not stopped and can be moderated to ensure no hate speech is written within those opinions.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	in what way?	investmen tin people
__label__Attack	I think comments provide additional context and a barometer for the reception of the article. Removing comments completely would be a shame!	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	Simply using a word filter would not be enough.  One of the things that makes hate speech so dangerous is that the people saying it know how to get around word filters to say hateful things without using banned words.  Word lists would also trigger false positives and potentially stop constructive discussion about the issue .	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__Attack	Re-educating is key to reducing hate speech.

__label__Support	yes, and full of impossible promises	It could increase democratic legitimacy
__label__Attack	I agree with your idea. However, there is a thin line between freedom of speech and hate speech. How will it be made more transparent to others what is what?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	This would be a great idea, however, it's also important to take into notice that everyone has their own biased; so one statement could be hate speech to one but not the other	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__Support	I think it is important to a) get the tories out and b) make sure reform dont have too strong a foothold.

__label__Attack	But too much freedom creates all the hate and toxicity we see in today's media 	haters may be removed is the system is able to identify them...so I think comment space can be kept but regulated 
__label__Support	Absolutely, the issue of sharing inflammatory or misleading news is important to address and change. News outlets are responsible for how they present their stories and how the narrative changes in the comment section below. They're also responsible for the real world violence as a result of willingly hosting hate speech on their platform whether they're active or inactive on their handling of the comments sections.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	While I see the logic to this argument, the publics interaction with paper newspapers and slower press looks to have declined according to this article, therefore I'm not sure this solution would work: https://clubs.waketech.edu/wake-review/magazine/creative-writing/non-fiction/the-decline-in-newspapers-a-closer-look-joseph-ahrens/	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments.  People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name.  The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously.  This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments.  Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.

__label__Support	I agree. This sounds like a good plan.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.

__label__Attack	Agreed. I found a similar article and the more people feel censored the more hate sites thrive. Instead of a platform where people can engage and educate.	The most surprising position was to completely eliminate the comments section. various studies have been conducted in this regard and they all agree on one thing and that deleting comments is not a good idea and can damage the general perception of the outlet. https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/
__label__Support	Collective ownership and action  	It's still too cold.

If you believe that its man made and that man caused it, then its possible and likely that man can fix it like anything else.

__label__Attack	I agree that we have to be very careful around censorship. Shutting commentary down because it doesn't fit your agenda or internal narrative can be very dangerous as it is a tool used by dictators.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	This can be a very good 1st level of filtering, and maybe if there are situations which are red-flagged in high intensity, they can go through a human vetting process also.	Discussion during the set-up of this project showed that there may be some significant areas of disagreement between heritage and climate practitioners. One obvious one is installing solar energy systems on older buildings. Deep retrofit may also be problematic. If we are to avoid turning these issues into disputes then it will be important to start by working out where there is consensus. Assuming that we accept the need for net zero then the question is how do we achieve that in situations where current tools for deploying clean energy may not be appropriate. Positive communication will be important to help us all see what good practice looks like and also how we agree for criteria for such practice.
__label__Attack	But is it even possible to fix now or is it too far gone?	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	But how would one be able to determine what is hate speech and what isn’t? For example someone could say the word n*gger in context of a historical discussion. Some black people would consider it hate speech and others wouldn’t. With people deciding what is and what isn’t hate speech with their subjective opinions, genuine non-hatefuelled opinions would not be posted and as a result this method would inhibit free speech unfairly to some degree.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	definately comments section should be monitored before it gets out to the public	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.

Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.

Pay more and get genuine people who have a desire to serve a common good. 	They have the clearest strategies of all the parties. Please read the manifestos!  
__label__Support	it's a survey question	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	Racists can no longer hide behind anonymity.	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them
__label__Support	agree, the comment section is an important tool to exchange your opinion with others	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__Support	Agreed, and it would still allow opinions to be shared	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__Support	"I agree and disagree, how do you educate someone who intentionally tries to misunderstand you because it doesn't support their current views"". But why give up entirely just because the odds are stacked against you for effectively swaying them from hateful thoughts. I think the better question is how do you sway someone who is firmly attached to hate speech? And how can we teach the people who care about human rights to talk to the less reasonable hate speech people in a way that penetrates their firmly held belief systems?"	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Absolutely, if you are discussing the topic at hand - articles are meant to engage readers and grab their attention.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	There are far more sustainablity actions that should be taken before dietary constrictions, like reducing the loop of consumption in the US which is based on inflation and debt generation.	I think hate pushing is wrong. 
__label__Support	We should aim to heat people :) not buildings (Cherry)	Not exaclty, you can't talk in a way that hurts other people
__label__Attack	We have flattened their countries and bled them dry, that is why they come seeking work.  The keep the NHS afloat.  	I'm 50/50 on this. Nothing is wrong with immigration if people are skilled and are willing to be skilled. If there is a lack of people wanting to up-skill, why not allow the immigrants to take the jobs!
__label__Attack	I agree that hate speech blocking reduces abuse, but abusers will find a way around it and discussion may be curbed accidentally. The issue with comments sections is the comments section itself, not just what's in them.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Someone has had to code that algorithm so it is already bias. Comments need a team of diverse moderators	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	However it might not stop some people as they could believe that their opinion is correct and not hate.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	This seems to have a slippery slope for restricting opinions.

__label__Attack	Anonymity may also prevent people to explore ideas they feel are taboo and prevent them from seeking help. e.g. addiction, some LGBTQ+ issues that are taboo in certain cultures etc.	I think that people should sign up and verify their identity before they are able to leave a comment on a news platform so they are not anonymous and anything that is written can be tracked to the individual and they can be held accountable. Many people write such hateful things anonymously.
__label__Support	sdfdsfsf	The easy way for a bot or system to analyze what could be a hate speech could be to select certain words that are usually associated to descrimination. This could be developed by studying existing comments and seeing what are the most repeated dialogues. 
__label__Attack	You are conflating two issues , enviromnet and climate change	Cost of Living crisis
__label__Attack	Most people are for comments on new articles as it makes them feel like they have a voice as evidenced by this article	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/npr-comments-decision-guardian-readers
__label__Support	I am trying to be realistic but my feelings towards politicians, in general, is that they are just not al that trustworthy.	Student loans are another big issue. We are saddling our children with debt as Universities are entering a financial crisis of tgheir own
__label__Attack	Less hate speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Freedom of speech is significant and readers must be able to express themselves negative or positive it is their right. Hence the need to keep the comment section but flagging or blocking users who make use of hate speech is a fair action to take.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	Then who is the judge and jury to decide what is right and what is wrong?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	People constantly find their way around word filters and more often than not it filters a lot of genuine non hate comments too.	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__Support	Can anyone tell the difference? Virtually the same people in different suits sitting opposite each other	We need a leader who can improve the economy and grow the NHS
__label__Attack	I don't think that's true anymore - working in a large corporation, 5 years ago, we would have never talked about sustainability, been willing to pay more for anything sustainable, or frankly, really been concerned. Now, we have no real choice - consumers are simply demanding it. 	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts. 
__label__Attack	Negative thought. I disagree. any effort will definitely make a difference. If hate speech is not monitored at all, racists and narcissistic people tend to grow and get away with so much	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Opinions can damaging and should not always be shared	comment sections are necessary so we can see different opinions on one topic
__label__Attack	extreme is also an apinion as long as it isnt damaging or offensive	preferences for extreme ethical opinions 
__label__Support	I can agree with this as Newspapers are not government or public services, they are companies trying to sell newspapers and subscriptions to their services for profit, the comments sections are there to bring more revenue into the company and keep more people logged in and using their websites	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Newspapers operate under their own distinct ownership and can thus set their own policies. Stores have their own methods of queuing for product, concert venues have their own methods of admitting attendees. Sites have no obligation to allow unsupervised public discourse.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Prior to implementing sustainable agriculture practices, we must first identify and list the geographical and area-specific challenges, and provide farmers with appropriate solutions to their issues, training, and real-world examples of successful farming.	For England? Sure.
__label__Support	I saw economists backing labour 	Please vote! Even if you go against the grain
__label__Attack	Problem being, who gets to decide what hate speech actually is? It's all very well claiming hate speech at the drop of at hat but often  it may be perceived as escalationary and over reactivity particularly to the level of juvenilty online discussion sometimes goes. I mean fine the web site providers are free to use their own discernment and reasonably can determine what does or doesn't feature on their website but that is not really conducive to cultivation an active user base.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	It is getter harder year by year by still possible.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	Whilst moderation can be good, you're at the whims of the moderators own thoughts and prejudices. And at times may not be acting in the interests of the organisation they're working for.	Through active moderation.
__label__Support	I definitely agree with what you are saying. I think a lot of hate speech and aggression starts when a user doesn't agree with your opinion and thinking their truth is the only truth.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, that feels like a reasonable approach. Although I'm a little bit skeptical what comes to its effectivity.	There could also be a disclaimer added before one can see other comments which encourage readers to fact-check and be mindful of what they're reading, while also having moderators.
__label__Attack	I don't agree. This would infringe on free speech. Rather have guidelines and censor any comments that promote hate speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	That is a very minimalistic view as there could be many words that get missed and what happens if someone uses normal words that make a hateful sentence	The website must have words that are automatically marked as unacceptable. whenever those words are included in a comment, the website must privately warn the sender and not allow the comment to go through until the comment is rephrased correctly and politely.
__label__Attack	People want to comment about what they've just read on the newspaper, they don't want to go to an external source to talk about it. Why would it be any better sending people elsewhere to do this? There must be a way to educate people as a way to prevent hate speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	I agree - the state of education is a mess!	no one can afford to rent a flat or house on their own now 
__label__Support	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	people have freedom of speech. which they can reflect upon their actions	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	The works for the newspaper only, no one will be able to  contest what is being written evn if it is wrong	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	Removing readers comments removes the users freedom of speech which is a basic human right	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	There is no way to restrict speech without censorship...so remove the option to comment rather than to censor.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	Education is a mess, particularly if you have a child with special needs. Months and months to battle for an EHCP and still no real help	Healthcare is really important to me. I think the government have been using immigration to blame their poor governance, it gives them someone to blame.  
__label__Attack	This is true	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	*affecting	Why trust any of them?
__label__Support	Some people are going through problems in their own life and express their anger online. None of which is acceptable.	"Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those ""conversations"" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void."
__label__Attack	However, we need a solution for this, else we may not be able to have any platforms at all.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	I don't believe that anybody who had the capacity to give rise to fake news can do something more powerful than commenting, and I think that filters being put into place would be more productive than completely eliminating to option to comment - this phenomenon will always exist and can easily take place on other platforms regardless	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	100%, and I would like my daughter to have a planet left to enjoy. I think also massive renewable energy infrastructure programmes are likely to help the economy and do our bit for climate change, but the government have been VERY hands off here, compared to e.g. Nordic countries or Germany. There's ways of supporting both. 	It just so happens we had to go to A&E yesterday as our daughter hurt her head. We were waiting for almost 3 hours and later found out that there was a doctors strike and didn't even manage to even see a doctor. We ended up leaving...
__label__Support	Yes I feel there are all these grand promises but very little info on how they will be funded 	The economy, defence, education, the environment, who would be a strong leader
__label__Support	comments don't need to involve hate speeck, one can comment without using these types of expressions,	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Support	Banning hate speech will radicalize people who will only feel more oppressed by the opposition trying to silence them.	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__Attack	Newspapers by their nature are polarised entities. Banning comments to diminish polarised opinions makes little sense if the newspapers themselves are pumping out polarised opinions.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	Yes definitely agree, but unfortunately even with help for a good deposit the house prices are so high that unless you earn a lot, nobody will lend you the remainder you need to borrow	If more people dont vote nothing is going to change - be part of the change. The way I see it is not voting is still making a choice and that is that nothing is going to change. I do see a point of not voting as I personally dont trust someone coming from a priviledged position to vote on my behalf as a minimum wage earner despite having a good and technical job (civil engineering) I cannot vote as funnily enough but if I could Id like to make an informed choice rather than be stuck with one and complain 
__label__Attack	I can see their point of view, however hate speech can't be considered a viewpoint as most times there isn't even a good enough argument to support people that leave hate speech's point of view.	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__Support	Hate speech is complex and jubjective. AI is still developing and not good enough to understand basic debate let alone interpret language, Too easy for AI to take words out of context.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__Support	I totally agree with you. Adding that the comment section must remain closed until the education of the people takes effect. Remembering that the learning process takes time to complete.	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__Support	Fully agree with this!	Investment into the construction sector. I'm not aware of any party having a strong stance that they will incest heavily (and intelligently). Things like HS2 are a great concept and help the economy, but not if the money is wasted on a non starter
__label__Attack	Hate speech can spread rapidly, and destroy lives. It is offensive, hurtful and can ruin people. I think this is a very bad opinion to take.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	There is always going to be fake news, thats what sells. Hate speech is not the same as voicing an opinion.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	This does not remove comments altogether	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__Attack	i dont think its possible to weigh hate speech. different peech hits differently to different people	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	Algorithms are not always accurate	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	"I think people who focus on supposed benefit scroungers are quite easily led, tbh. You're focusing on people at the bottom rather than at the top, and if you really think those at the top all ""earned it through hard work"" you've been had!"	If we are so badly off then why won't the English parties let us have another referendum.  We are so much more worse off because of Brexit which Scotland didn't vote in favour of.

__label__Attack	It can be difficult to monitor everything all the time, but I think if something is reported and not deleted then fair enough.	i think a law should be made that if you do not delete hate speech from your website or article than that newspaper will have to pay a fine.
__label__Support	Is there a particular country that you think does it well and we should model ours on? 	Rebulding the NHS, better education, taxation, honesty and integrity of elected representitives
__label__Attack	Not to be rude, but I doubt people who post hateful comments would care. Imagine someone telling a bully that they're rude - I don't think this would change anything in their behaviour.	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time

__label__Support	It is great to ban them but they would create different profiles again to put out their comments. One good side of this idea is that they would consistently have to do extra work in creating new profiles to put out their hate speeches, and hopefully,  one day they would be tired and give up.	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__Support	I agree. A big importance for newspapers is the comment section and people's opinion to what they have written. Although, the companies should take some responsibility to monitor the comments and what the other users will see.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I think this is a good idea, I would start with education, if that is not helping then restricting the person from commenting.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	newspapers should remain impartial and hate speech leans on an opinion.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	some people would still make hate comments, as they could give a false name to begin with.	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__Support	Agree, Brexit was definitely partially to blame. I do feel some of the people voted that for immigration reasons only...whereas I know numerous people that whilst they voted for Brexit they said it changed nothing and made things worse 	Agreed - in some situations, people choose not to work as they would be financially worse off. That needs changing.
__label__Attack	I agree that some regulation and introduction of the standards of communication is necessary to allow for maintaining comment space open for everybody.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Absolutely, and primarily any action has to be taken by civil society. There are examples of good practice within voluntary and non-governmental organisations but these are not yet common practice. The scale and balance of power needs to shift and resources found to develop this work as part of a core purpose.	We need an action programme to develop a more inclusive sector 
__label__Attack	that requires people who play by the rules	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__Attack	This would be removing freedom of speech. I think that is a very problematic road to go down.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	But who is going to pay for all thee changes?
