__label__Support	The EU has some rules on how social security systems are coordinated (Regulation 883/2004/EC). EU rules ensure that the pension rights accrued in each country are added together and paid out by the pension insurance institution of the Member State of affiliation. But the bureaucratic nightmare is probably just as guaranteed. A better solution would be a transparent and digital platform that collects pension entitlements from all EU member states. That way, every citizen would have an overview of his or her pension entitlements at all times, not just until when they are due.	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__Support	I find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice.

Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people
__label__Support	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people.

__label__Attack	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.	We do not want illegal migration.

__label__Support	Esperanto is politically neutral: it is not used by any European nation. Although there is some culture connected to the language, there is no political or economic power imposing it. Also, where English is connected to the US, Canada, Australia, and other countries, Esperanto would be a truly European language.	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities

__label__Support	Esperanto is linguistically neutral: The language was created with the principle of internationality in a European context. It’s democratic: There are no native speakers of Esperanto, or better yet not any monolingual speakers of Esperanto. Everyone has to learn it as a second language. As a result of this nobody will have an advantage over others and nobody can feel like a 'stranger' since nobody can feel like a 'native'. Everyone is respected regardless of their origin and not discouraged from learning the language.	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities

__label__Attack	Almost 3 lakh people were employed in the firecracker industry in these places, and 5 lakh people in packaging, transporting, distributing, and selling these crackers. Thus, the ban would also mean huge unemployment in these states.	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Attack	Bursting crackers on Diwali has always been on the to-do list in every family. A Deepavali without firecrackers will definitely be a cut-down in entertainment and recreation for the kids, as well as the elders.	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Support	Banning firecrackers in some places currently having pollution at its peak like Delhi-NCR will obviously bring down the poisonous emission of gases which has deadly effects on the entire balanced ecosystem. The highest level of particulate matter recorded in Delhi was 2.5 in the year 2016, which indeed made Delhi the most polluted city in the world in terms of air pollution. The “Central Pollution Control Board” also stated that the level of sulfur dioxide in the air gets tremendously high between 9 p.m. till midnight during Deepavali.	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Support	The crackers regulated in the market comprise chemical components like saltpeter, carbon, and sulfur. When these are ignited altogether, hazardous oxides of gases are emitted which cause suffocation, reduce visibility, and other health hazards. Medical experts state that the air gets contaminated with toxic gases and remains for days after Diwali. The toxic elements that reach the lungs, cannot be removed thereafter and can cause grave health issues. This will cause long-term effects on children.	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Attack	With the ban, religious sentiments get triggered too. In 2017, the Hindu community raised questions about the ban on Christmas trees on Christmas, or slaughter of lamb on Eid, or colors on Holi, etc., thinking it to be against their communal practices.

__label__Support	As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.	The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe
__label__Support	Agreed, BUT only on one condition: that every euro be spent under the joint control of local and European officers.

__label__Support	I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East.

They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems.

This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment

__label__Support	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Support	Although there is an immense increase in the number of TCN migrant workers, there is no adequate policy in protecting their rights. Anyone in Europe should be entitled to the same worker’s rights, no matter where they come from. As migration is an issue that is dealt with by all countries, we must find a common answer at the EU level.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Support	The Dublin Agreement leaves EU member states with an external border completely alone to deal with the challenge of immigration. This must stop! Not only because solidarity in the EU is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overburdening of states left alone with this challenge creates intolerable situations for the refugees.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Attack	Before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have nice conditions in the EU, we should first focus on ensuring that our own people can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Attack	Each country must have the right to choose based on a democratic vote, how many immigrants they want to accept.

__label__Attack	Giving immigrants more rights will lead to the forced displacement and eventual erasure of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what's happening to the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China is genocide then so is this.

__label__Attack	We haven't got enough jobs and money for everyone in Europe! Stop immigration! However, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia have it! These countries can therefore welcome migrants instead of funding hundreds of mosques in Europe!	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__Attack	Why do we even let in migrants who do not speak the language of the country where they wish to reside? Migration is bad for the nations and degrading for the migrants. We must work to end mass migration.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__Attack	Indigenous Europeans have no obligation to take in any more migrants, and neither do they want to. This is being forced on us.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__Support	It's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).

It would be best that this is provided both in the person's mother tongue and in the language of the host country.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs

__label__Support	Working in sectors in ample need of workers, such as the agricultural fields, will help to integrate immigrants once their situation has been legalized.

We prefer and are more comfortable with online chatting instead of talking to people for real. There are fewer meaningful relationships nowadays because of all the above factors. We have started preferring isolation.	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good
__label__Support	Nuclear technology is a very efficient alternative to non-renewable energy resources. But still, we chose to move ahead with more and more types of nuclear warheads. The same is the case with almost every other invention. Similarly, though initially, AI promised better lives for us, because of AI, we have started losing our basic human qualities.

__label__Attack	The British people voted for Brexit, so now naturally they have to live with their choice. It turns out you can't actually have your cake and eat it too.	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__Support	I think this is a good idea, but unfortunately it's framed as a British/brexit issue. However, the wider concept of a common EU visa / migration system is a compelling one. Harmonising the system to a common visa regime offers many advantages.	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__Attack	British people are not better than anyone else and do not deserve special treatment from the EU. The British people will face the consequences of their decision to leave the EU and it is not the EU's responsibility to make Brexit painless. The benefits of membership cannot be bestowed upon citizens of countries outside the EU/EEA, like the UK.	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__Support	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.

__label__Attack	It has been seen that it is difficult to retain employees in lean times when they are on variable pay schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when business is good, but they do poorly when business is bad. In times of slow business, even top salespeople might have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent living. If the market is slow and commissioned workers can’t earn enough, they may look for other employment opportunities. In lean times, fixed wages can be more effective at keeping employees from leaving for other opportunities.	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme
__label__Attack	Variable pay can lead to unhealthy competition between employees. They become less willing to help each other. Team co-operation may get affected negatively. In the long run, relations among colleagues may turn bitter. Whereas, in fixed pay schemes, the employees are able to maintain cordial relationships in the office.	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme
__label__Attack	Mostly, sales jobs have a variable component. This might negatively impact the employee’s attitude towards customers. They may force the customers irrationally just to make profits for themselves. They might overstate the price to the customers just to make more profit. Whereas, an employee with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relations with the customers, striking the right balance in their approach.

__label__Support	Since the invention of machines, the value of workers is decreasing. They are made to work to support the machines. As a result, work revolves around machines and not humans. Workers are forced to work continuously along with the machine.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	People are now engaging in trolling and cyberbullying. Hiding behind devices is giving them the courage to harass other people, which they may not do face-to-face. This is the deterioration of moral values.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	Some companies are building strategies to use their apps for a longer time, to keep us addicted to their apps and devices so that they can show advertisements to us. And also they can use our data to manipulate our decisions for their profits. These strategies are turning humans into just targets.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	Industrialization increased work hours. Workers faced inhuman conditions. Humans cannot work and focus continuously like machines. Fast forward to today, we have technological devices to check how many hours we actually work. Some companies want to be connected 24 hours a day through emails and messages. This makes people feel less human.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	Our decision-making skills are also getting affected as we are now asking search engines to know what is best. We are depending on the knowledge base of the internet even at offices to finish the work at hand. This affects cognitive skills ( to think, read, learn, remember, and reason), which is an essential quality of humans.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	Many face-to-face communications are also replaced with virtual interactions. Many people are now living in virtual homes, which is the smartphone. As the need for talking with each other is reducing, the ability to communicate with each other which is a basic quality of living beings is declining.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	We are increasingly depending on technological devices to guide us. For example, we keep reminders on smartphones and google the questions for answers.

__label__Support	sustainable and animal-friendly farms grow their own feed and create an ecological cycle.	Intensive livestock farming should disappear
__label__Support	The current subsidies with a modular system of incentives should be replaced, as that empowers farmers to choose environmentally, socially, and financially responsible and sustainable solutions that are already available - like natural sequence farming, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, etc.	Intensive livestock farming should disappear
__label__Support	In Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal feed. In determining how much subsidy a holding receives, the area of the holding is decisive. In other words, a lot of land, a large amount of subsidy. This results in cheap animal feed and, ultimately, intensive livestock farming. Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.	Intensive livestock farming should disappear

__label__Attack	The European Parliament has developed avenues for a common foreign and defense policy and should exercise its role this way.

__label__Support	I am all for the creation of a European army, but for that, the question of the command of this army must also be resolved. And this is where the idea of a European Security Council is very interesting and deserves to be pushed.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	I am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction. So NGOs and development cooperation must be involved. An army that can fight must also be able to build. We therefore also need a civilian army in Europe. I would also like an army consisting of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army. Please also take into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objection, also as in the German army.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	Absolutely right. Europe needs an army for continental defense. Conscription must be introduced at the European level. The army must have the most modern weapons to deter Russia, Turkey, and China.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	I agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	On the one hand, we have Russia killing countless Ukrainians and committing sabotage in Britain and the Czech Republic, and on the other hand, we have reluctant United States that is switching between isolationist and interventionist policies every 4-8 years. I stand convinced, that in order for the European Union to move forward, it must begin to introduce measures for the security of both, the current member states as well as the future member states that are endangered due to foreign aggression and bring the responsibility of continental safety firmly in our own hands. If Europe is to find the peace it must have the means to create peace by being able to protect itself against hostile foreign influences.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	The EU cannot endlessly lean on America or NATO. America has proven to be fickle and NATO has its own problems, such as Turkey, which is outside the EU and has threatened Greece. The EU needs its own independent solution.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states

__label__Attack	The World, in particular Africa and the Middle East, is experiencing a huge population explosion. They seem not to be able to cope with it as China did. Who is going to take all these millions of refugees which result from it? Also, consider that the integration of one non-western immigrant costs 167.000 euros. If the EU intends to survive it has to stop more or less all migration.	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy
__label__Support	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU. Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.	The EU should enforce minority protection
__label__Support	Unfortunately, the values and rights are interpreted and exercised differently in the states of the European Union. Whether we are speaking about minority protection, language rights, or cultural values. We can see every day that the EU is constantly retaliating against the Hungarians in Transylvania, when, despite the legislation in force, it ignores the lawlessness and atrocities committed against the Hungarians as a native minority. Furthermore, the European Union should give priority to all situations in which Hungarians in Transylvania are victims of discrimination.	The EU should enforce minority protection

__label__Support	The undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Support	Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Attack	Directly electing the president of the commission makes the most susceptible to political sway, which would kill the commission as a body of technical experts.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU

The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Attack	In Germany, the President of the Executive is not elected by the people directly either. The reason for this is the horrible experience during the Third Reich. The Parliament - as the only constitutional institution being directly elected - has a stronger stand if the President is not elected directly. However I definitely support, that the Parliament becomes stronger and more influential.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Attack	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Attack	The European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else. An elected head of the Commission would make nonsense of the principle of independence that is vital to the trust in the Commission's job. He or she would be beholden to the group that elected him or her and make the job impossible.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Support	European political parties should be independent of national parties.

__label__Support	The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike.

Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__Support	Public services of good quality and universal access are key to ensuring fairer, more inclusive, and equal societies.

Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health

__label__Attack	At present, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure the security of data. On the other hand, developed countries already have an efficient infrastructure. So, rushing toward data localization may not be a wise step. Because without efficient infrastructure, the data is prone to cyber-attacks. And the risk is severe here because it is financial data. But as the laws are made, it is a big challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Attack	Storing data in India means higher operational costs for payment system operators. Because in other countries they have cheaper alternatives. And also for cross-border transactions, they have to store the data in two places, which increases costs. There is a probability that these extra costs may pass on to the consumers.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Support	Data localization laws result in the setting up of multiple data centers locally. This will create many jobs and will help the country’s economy immensely. It will also drive innovation in the field resulting in low-cost solutions.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Support	While investigating crimes, there will be a need to access the payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to take permission from that country for access to the data. This causes delays in solving crimes. If the data is stored here within our country, this problem will be avoided.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Support	India is a big consumer market for many foreign companies. So, India and other developing countries are realizing the economic value of the data and the importance of data localization. With data localization, domestic companies and the country’s economy will be benefited. And we can also ensure the security of the data.

__label__Support	Data is considered a ‘new form of wealth’. Generally, companies use data to understand the requirements of consumers and also to influence their behavior.

__label__Attack	We are in a globalized world. At present, the world is running on the free flow of people, goods, services, and data. Data localization laws seem to be a part of protectionist policies, which is a threat to the free flow of data.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Attack	The US is against data localization laws. Recently at the G20 summit, Donald Trump, the president of the US spoke against data localization. Its stance is natural because it increases the operational costs of US companies. India-US bilateral relations are important for both countries because we are intertwined in the export and import of IT services, professionals and goods, etc. So, imposing data localization laws without threatening Indo-US relations is another challenge.

__label__Attack	Data localization may result in government surveillance of its citizens.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country

__label__Support	Europe was composed of 13 countries in 1870 and 23 in 1914. Maybe it's time to change borders without bloodshed.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	We live in the XXI century. We do not want any repression of peripheries by their state center. Within the European Union, we should welcome the blessing of decentralism and localism, including the self-determination of stateless peoples and stronger autonomies within confederal agreements. If not in Europe, where? If not now, when?	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR), ‘[a]ll peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The right to self-determination also has its economic content which gives the people the right to freely ‘dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law.'	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	Self-determination is a basic collective human right. Catalans practiced this right in 2017. Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence. Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start. If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially. This crucial step will enforce European democracy, the Democracy of Citizens that feel free and respected within European borders.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	Every nation with its own language and culture, which demands the same status as a sovereign nation within Europe, must have the right to be recognized and respected by people and other member nations/states.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	There are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	The right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	In a democracy, people have the right to decide on any issue that affects their lives. If more than half of the inhabitants of a region want to form an independent state, they have the right to do so. Going against it is going against the will of the majority of citizens, and therefore, against the very essence of democracy.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
__label__Support	France should offer its seat on the UN Security Council, so European interests are represented.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

__label__Attack	Promoting, organizing, and directing mass migration is a crime against humanity. Lukashenko is currently committing exactly this heinous crime.

__label__Support	It is necessary that member states better share the efforts of receiving asylum seekers upon arrival at EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to frontline countries. The EU should develop a joint approach to support the frontline countries to assure that asylum seeker are provided adequate care, assistance, and protection upon arrival and are quickly distributed evenly throughout the EU for status determination.	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__Support	The root causes to leave their home countries should not be overlooked. The EU and its member states need to increase efforts to make the countries of origin more liveable.	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__Attack	Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications.

The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__Attack	This idea is what we have been doing for the last 30 years. It did not produce sufficient results to justify continuing on this path. It is just saying, that problem will solve itself. This proposition is harmful and does not stand on any data that could justify it.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__Attack	It is not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognizing patterns, reasons, and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in a vacuum. If it is easier and cheaper to live not sustainably, people will do it, even if they are conscious of the consequences.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__Attack	We should arrange our cities, our economy, and politics so that it is easy for people to behave ecologically responsibly.

__label__Support	Intensive Care Medicine deserves to be added to the Annex V, as well as all citizens of the EU deserve top standards of critical care and safety when admitted to this demanding environment.	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists
__label__Support	The pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves. We saw patients in very critical condition being moved away from their families from one Member State to another to receive treatment while allowing the doctors to move would be much more efficient and less life-threatening for the patients.	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists
__label__Attack	I find the current actions of China to be incompatible with the ideology that the EU was formed and still has to this day, we can not have a relaxed attitude towards a country that sees all the world as competitors and enemies.	The EU should strengthen its relationship with China.

__label__Support	If all costs, including CO2 emissions of the production, the extraction of resources and its consequences for the region (environment and humans), ecosystem damage, recycling of the waste, and so on and so forth would be monetized and internalized in the costs of the products, many of our problems would be solved. It would simply make the more environmentally friendly products cheaper than the others and their production economically smarter.	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products
__label__Support	In a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products
__label__Support	why should every country in the EU be sovereign in energy production? Within the countries also not every region is sovereign in this sense. We need to take advantage of the geographic potentials of the european continent for pragmatic solutions	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__Support	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Support	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Support	It is absolutely necessary that we have a system of accountability, both for member states and other countries. Human rights and liberties always come first!	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Attack	The European Union is not a country and we must respect other countries' electoral choices.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	Mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	Several member states have been turned into dictatorships a year ago, and there is no sign of a return to democracy. Freezing temporarily their EU membership status is to be considered to those where there is no more freedom in crossing borders (BE), even inside borders (DE, FR), no more press freedom (most), no more debate (most), no more press or individual liberty.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	To have any credibility when addressing foreign countries regarding issues of human rights violations, curbs on the freedom of speech and press, democracy, and more, the EU must ensure that its Member States meet minimum standards on these fronts too.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Attack	The EU has no business 'promoting democracy' anywhere beyond its borders. Have we not seen sufficiently clearly in the past two decades where 'democracy export' leads?! Freedom bombs and human suffering everywhere. No, the EU must fully respect the sovereignty and national characters of all nations of this world. And that includes its own member states. The EU must immediately return to the letter of the EU treaties, and reaffirm in the strongest term the principles of conferral and subsidiarity.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	The EU should do it in an impartial manner and act against all countries regardless of political ideology. The EU should stand out to help all minorities and not just the politically advantageous ones. The oppression of Catalonians and Hungarian minorities outside its border is a constant problem since WW2 and it is completely ignored. If the EU wants to convince the masses, then it can't just cherrypick issues.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	Without a change in the voting procedure, Europe will not be capable of doing much in this world.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__Support	The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__Attack	The EU should not get involved in trying to ”spread democracy” with threats and punishments, leave that to the US.	Europe should change the world for the better for everyone.
__label__Support	The integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about. Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development? They are as much Europeans as we are.	The European Union shall guarantee its territorial integrity against threats from Russia and shall seek to eliminate the influence of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe.
__label__Attack	Do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately. The EU does not have an actual army - not because of bureaucrats but because our member states think they are better alone than united.	Europe should stand together!
__label__Support	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener. In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Support	The incentive to provide free public transport in European cities in the future would make it easier for people, especially in the cities, to accept and appreciate that there will be fewer and fewer cars. People who benefit from current examples are happy about it.	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Support	I think the EU should subsidies troubled cash-strapped cities to reduce ticket prices or completely remove any charges so that people are vivisected to hop on the bus rather than in the car. As I student, I would have been in the city center a lot more and spent money around the shops if I could afford the bus fair in the first place.	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Support	Such a platform if it provides youngsters with free or at least affordable mental-health assistance, will help them finally able to overcome our society’s barriers to taking care of our mental health and emotional well-being.	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__Attack	There is a reason why these states don't want to join the common currency: their economies are more flexible and doing far better without it. If we really want more countries to start using the euro, we need to make the euro better, not pressure or force others into our inefficient system.	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency
__label__Attack	We certainly need levels of government at the global, regional, and local levels. Equally, we absolutely need democracy at the global, regional, and local levels. Neither the European nor the national and regional parliaments should be abolished because of the need for global governance for the planet.	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government.
__label__Support	According to the United Nations Convention on the rights of people with disabilities, the European Union “shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities” on political decisions that concern them. Meanwhile the “European Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030” hardly mentioned people with intellectual and neurological disabilities. Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities. Ableism keeps getting perpetuated in the EU and it needs to stop. We want more representation! We want people with Down Syndrome to be fully included in the European Union institutions!	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	Aborting children with Down is not love, is not an inclusive society, it is discrimination against the most vulnerable.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	People with trisomy 21 in Europe have much higher rates of unemployment, social exclusion, poverty, and discrimination. The European Union must make it a priority to change this situation.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	Europe must lead the way when it comes to integrating people with Down syndrome	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	The United States is investing an average of more or less 25 million euros per year on health care research for people with Trisomy 21 while the European Union is lagging far behind with only 3 million per year. This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	A common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data. The data should be accessible for public research and used for monitoring public health e.g. by European institutions	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform

The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__Support	Juridical protection of dignity, right to life, and integrity of every human being from conception are of fundamental importance for the future of Europe. The dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle vs Greenpeace case, which recalls the definition of the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit that presuppose the destruction of human embryos.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__Support	We are all here to fight the prohibition of eugenic practices such as abortion which organize and consequently encourage the preventive elimination of individuals who do not comply with the social, medical, and family criteria set by the ideal of man. What a perfect 21st century!	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__Support	From the Association Christian in Democracy (Spain), we are clear that life is the greatest good of a society and as such must be protected from its conception to its natural end. For this reason, it should be part of the European Union's charter of fundamental rights and be protected from attacks against defenseless human beings, such as in the cases of abortion and euthanasia.

__label__Attack	Consensual sex can also be termed as rape if the wife is willing to file a false case. There will be no proof to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men based on the mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.	Marital rape should be criminalized in India
__label__Attack	The most misused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to file a case on a husband and his family in case of dowry harassment. Many women are using this law to extort money and property from their in-laws. If the law on marital rape comes into effect, many innocent men will be at threat.	Marital rape should be criminalized in India
__label__Support	Sexual violence violates human rights, irrespective of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates against married women for using the section on their husbands. Though one can file a case under the domestic violence act for marital rape, not terming marital rape as a crime will deter the victims from filing cases. Every law on the planet is prone to be misused. That doesn’t mean that we should not have laws in order to avoid false cases.	Marital rape should be criminalized in India
__label__Attack	Article 15 of Indian constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender. But the proposed law on marital rape in the petitions recognizes only female victims. Hence it is discriminatory to male victims.	Marital rape should be criminalized in India

__label__Attack	A cashless economy will increase the number of cybercrimes.	We should stop using cash
__label__Attack	Technical issues in banking can halt access to our money. This can interfere with our daily lives.	We should stop using cash
__label__Attack	No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget. And until the democratic deficit and other systemic problems in the EU are fixed, it's good that the budget is kept at 1-2% of the total EU GDP.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.

__label__Attack	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__Support	Real democracy cannot do without economic democracy. If the major decisions about our future life (investments, inventions, production) are made outside social control, then there is no real democracy. Without proper social consultation, there is no prospect for a fair Europe.	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__Support	We need to strengthen citizens' trust in the European project! This requires more transparency and accountability, in particular when it comes to access to documents and democratic decision-making. The 'Better Regulation' approach of the Commission which focuses on cutting costs and burdens prioritizes business interests over general interests and should be abandoned. The European project needs to benefit the many and not the few!	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability

__label__Attack	Just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Attack	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries

__label__Support	Stop woke ideology introducing Orwellian newspeak!	EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen”
__label__Support	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate. The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country. There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes. Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__Attack	It's the same with citizens of the USA using Americans to describe themselves. Yes, technically it isn't correct, but who cares...	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU
__label__Support	The only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans. This must change.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__Support	The political composition of the European Council - and therefore the EU’s political center of gravity - continuously changes during the EU political cycle, thus preventing clearer government majorities to emerge within these two European Councils.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__Support	National elections synchronization would finally make it possible to strengthen the effectiveness of the Council of the EU, by eliminating the blockages caused by the constant renewal of Ministers, which considerably slows down decision-making.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__Support	Synchronizing national elections would allow European citizens to engage in major pan-European campaigns.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__Support	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__Support	Less disruption to public life, less road traffic, and less loss to our economy. As all the government staff can be used at a single time, we can also increase vigilance, and factors like black money, booth capturing, etc. can be reduced.	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Attack	Holding both elections together will also mean mixing up the national issues with those of the state. The national issues would overpower the state which in turn would get less priority from the politicians.	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Attack	When state elections are conducted along with the center the regional parties may get marginalized because the same party getting majority in the center may get votes in the state as well.	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Attack	Frequent elections in the country will bring politicians back to the public frequently whereas cutting down on elections would mean making them lazy for the rest of the term and suddenly becoming overactive during the election year.	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Support	The cohesion funds have become a mechanism for local oligarchs and political elites to maintain their power and influence within national contexts, thus resulting in utilizing EU funds for their own personal or political gains and withholding the benefits from the people in cities and regions.	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__Support	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__Support	it is essential that environmental concerns and sustainability are the foundation of any treaty with our European Union!	Political institutions should make fundamental changes in the way they address climate change and environmental protection
__label__Attack	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__Attack	Migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.

To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.
__label__Attack	Technology brings people together when they are distant, accelerates bureaucratic procedures, it allows us to work from home or from any country in the EU or outside. It allows for an immense flow of information to be easily accessible to us. As long as people do not want to do illegal online activities, it is each person’s individual decision what to do with their own online time or how much time they might want to be online.

__label__Attack	Forty years of UK membership in the European Union have clearly proven that it is not a good idea to conclude agreements with England.	The EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO

__label__Support	In fact, political NGOs advocating for any cause whatsoever should be banned from schools and kindergartens.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__Support	As Europe bears the burden of the XXth century authoritarian regimes (right and left) and saw their children ideologically possessed by fascist and communist governmental propaganda (Hitlerjugend (right) and Pioneer (left) movements), we need to limit the access of the children - as one of the most vulnerable groups of our community - to every political ideology and propagating associations.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__Attack	This bill gave exclusive powers to the ‘National Investigation Agency’ (NIA). NIA can take any person into their custody under UAPA without taking prior permission from the state government. This is against the federalism, which is guaranteed by the constitution of India.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Attack	Labelling organisations as terror organisations and labelling individuals as terrorists are quite different. If a person is named as a terrorist, he/she will face social exclusion and will be devoid of livelihood opportunities even if he/she proved otherwise. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone 67% of the cases ended in acquittal, which means they are probably innocent.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Attack	If someone is booked under UAPA, the burden of proving their innocence is on them. This new amendment is enabling the government to seize their properties. Then how will they pay for legal expenses to prove their innocence, if they are falsely accused?	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Attack	This will provide more police powers to the central government. The provision of naming individuals as terrorists can be misused. For example, recently several civil activists are termed as Urban Naxals. If anyone opposes the government, they will be vulnerable to be framed as terrorists. Because this amendment made it easier to label anyone as a terrorist.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	There is a growing threat of lone-wolf terrorism. Lone wolf terrorists do not have any association with terrorist organizations, but they commit terror attacks alone by themselves. This new amendment to UAPA has the potential to curb lone-wolf terrorism.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	To prevent the violation of human rights, four-stage scrutiny is added. Designating individuals as terrorists is not started by India. The US, European Union, and China also have this provision.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	Till now, only organizations were designated as terrorist organizations, but not individuals. The loophole in this is the individuals of the banned organizations are forming new organizations and carrying out terror activities. This amendment bill for the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists, thereby terror attacks can be prevented.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	There is a need to act tough on terrorism amid growing threats from terrorists. So, strengthening UAPA is necessary.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	Refugees are forcibly displaced. They flee their country for several reasons such as violence, human rights violations, war, persecution of minorities, etc. Often they face threats to life in their home countries. They leave their homes and everything else in search of a safer place to live.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	At present, many countries are refusing refugees stating that they pose an economic or security threat. Only a few countries including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Liberia are accepting most of the refugees. Some host countries are forcibly sending refugees back to their home countries stating that such as the situation in their home countries is safe. Many refugees who were sent like this went through brutal violence and some people even disappeared.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	All countries should share the responsibility for refugees. Resettlement of the refugees should be done without much delay. They should be provided with skill development courses and employment opportunities to help them in living a dignified life.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	A weak global response is worsening the situation of refugees. The international community should help in rebuilding the war-torn countries, where refugees are coming from, so that safe and dignified returns are possible for refugees. Refugees should not be forcibly sent to their home countries.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	Many developed countries are spending so much money to protect their borders, but are not spending any money for protecting the lives of refugees. More funding is required to protect refugees.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	This is especially true when we know how much alcohol is damaging the brain, in particular in the developing brain of teenagers. Also unlike cannabis, over-consumption of alcohol leads to death so I would say that this product is much more dangerous. Yet unlike cannabis, alcohol is legal.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Support	In France, political repression fueled by rightwing ideology and ignorance led cities like Marseille to develop rampant crime that fed on the lucrative market of cannabis. Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Support	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Support	Today, cannabis repression is simply a political posture aimed to target rightwing voters, not a rational policy.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Support	Whenever you find yourself in crisis, and the EU is in crisis, it is a good idea to return to core business. And in the case of the EU, the core business is economy, trade, and security. That's where the focus should be.

__label__Attack	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU. The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU. Almost all people are without a useful education. There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing

The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat
__label__Attack	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced. When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat

It would cause so much more bureaucracy 2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat? 3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.

__label__Support	These days, every man is considered as a potential rapist. If a woman makes a false molestation complaint against a man out of revenge or any other motive, society is more likely to believe the woman's words. Society and media exposes the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in genuine cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However the same is not true with the complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt about the genuinity of the case. What if the sexual harassment case against the man is a false case? Some people think like men can take anything. False molestation cases will result in the irreversible loss of reputation and causes mental agony to the accused and his family.	Men are silent sufferers in this modern world

And the saddest thing is that girl can complain against her sister-in-law and sister-in-law's husband too under domestic violence, even if they are not staying at her place. Women can be as cruel as men in harassing their life partner.	Men are silent sufferers in this modern world

If you insist on a set of shared EU principles and values that go beyond a mere symbolic declaration, these principles and values must include our real heritage: the Judeo-Christian values that have made Europe great. Traditional family values are first and foremost. All these values must be clearly defined in a legal sense.	The European Union, as a Union of values, should limit its support to countries that do not want to adhere to European values and violate the rights of their citizens
__label__Support	Why everything is seen in a sexual nature? Brahmacharya doesn't mean women cannot worship god. Brahmacharya means observing celibacy. It doesn't mean that there shouldn't be female devotees of reproductive age. Narrow-minded people do not understand the difference between devotion and sexual attraction.	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions
__label__Support	Some other temples also ban women, and some temples ban men. If it is the same situation with Sabarimala, people wouldn't have bothered about it.

Not allowing menstruating women in temples sends a wrong message to people and future generations.	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions

__label__Support	Transparency is the first key to real democracy. Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings. Or think about all the meetings between diplomats (Coreper) and civil servants (working groups and committees), where ±90% of decisions are made, for the Council to be rubberstamped. Meetings that most citizens don't even know about.	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press

__label__Support	Raising prices in the energy sector cannot be the solution in the fight against climate change. The European Commission allows international firms to increase their prices, and as a result, household costs are rising at an incredible rate. The EU should definitely revoke these decisions, and instead of placing the burden on its own citizens, it should instead support them to lead a more sustainable way of life. The green transition should not be a heavy burden borne on the average citizen’s shoulders	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy
__label__Support	As Yuval Noah Harari says “What we need now are morality and spirituality. Morality is about reducing suffering in the world. And spirituality is about questioning and looking for answers. Religions provide us just with answers and no scope of questions.”	The world does not need religion anymore
__label__Support	Religion has served its purpose of uniting people, setting up structures in society, and developing trust and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are thriving towards objective realities, and religion is an inter-subjective reality and now the only thing it does is create differences in the world, brainwash people, develop animosity for other beliefs, and provide rituals that are just shortcuts to becoming a good person. (A Muslim may pray 5 times a day; a Hindu may pray daily for hours in temples; a Christian may go to church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities).	The world does not need religion anymore
__label__Support	In the past, every unknown thing dealt with religious beliefs. But now Science & Technology has taken over everything.

__label__Support	Indians as a whole consider educational institutions as job machines, we expect to enter unemployed and come out with employment. We don’t realize that we will have to upgrade our skills to become worthy of employment. This is the reason that more than 80% of engineers are unemployable and the figures are even worse for the non-engineers.	We should subsidize higher education institutions
__label__Support	Though we have been establishing national-level institutes for the past 40 years, we haven’t been investing to maintain their standards. Funds are needed for quality education. Even the top Indian institutes lack proper infrastructure, labs, resources, etc. And even whatever is available is just for the sake of passing the students in the examination and sitting idle the rest of the time.

This way, we can establish a single common market.	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union
__label__Support	With highly subsidized agricultural products the EU destroys local markets in African countries. This procedure should be stopped as soon as possible.

Also, this will lead to a better relationship with African Union and enable better livelihoods for African farmers and citizens,	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union
__label__Support	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas.

__label__Attack	The intention of helping a country with democratization can easily be used to justify violent actions.	We need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy.
__label__Attack	'We most definitely do not need a wider definition of 'gender-based' anything. 'Gender' is a politicized left-wing concept. I certainly encourage wider protection from violence against women and girls. That should most definitely include protection from the violence and coercion young women face from 'trans' activists. We also want nothing to do with 'intersectionality' which is a neo-Marxist concept of overlapping oppressions. No one is being oppressed in Europe.

__label__noRel	This single migration policy should include that: Brussels (EU) handles the paperwork and logistics. Including, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants.	The EU needs a European research center
__label__noRel	There is scientific consensus on the fact that fish have the ability to feel pain and emotions such as fear.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__noRel	Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.	We should protect bird habitats in built environments
__label__noRel	Energy is a human right and free energy production is a human right as well.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__noRel	Europe’s rapid Islamisation must be stopped. It is, therefore, necessary to stop the illegal migration of African and Asian people who do not fit with European culture.	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.	There should be a better post-Brexit European Alliance
__label__noRel	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger.	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	The United States is investing an average of more or less 25 million euros per year on health care research for people with Trisomy 21 while the European Union is lagging far behind with only 3 million per year. This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21.	The EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation
__label__noRel	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex).	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__noRel	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees
__label__noRel	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.	We need a Europe that respects life from conception is a humane Europe
__label__noRel	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.).	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people
__label__noRel	I have never heard anyone talking in Europe about world supremacy. So it seems kind of pointless that this is a goal of EU policy.	We need a better migration policy.
__label__noRel	The random radical constitutional foundation of the EU only riles hesitant populaces without solving a particular problem.	There should be 6 concrete proposals for migrants on the Balkan route.
__label__noRel	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality
__label__noRel	Without change, the EU will be following the route of the USSR and other communist countries, who after 70 years of trying to build a social paradise ended in poverty and suppression.	We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines
__label__noRel	What we are now seeing are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over years the population will have grown to 2,0 billion. That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today. At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear. Not much of a future for the young Europeans.	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__noRel	Europe is full and cannot accept more illegal migrants. Those persons must be sent back and have to ask for approval from their state of origin.	Climate neutrality can be achieved only by nuclear energy
__label__noRel	If the EU intends to survive it has to integrate less. Go back to the EEC. Instead of building a static bloc, it should increase competitiveness.	There should be a single EU policy.
__label__noRel	I totally agree, maybe would be glad if a press company could be sanctioned for misleading information, or even if it repeats, they could have their press licenses voided. It is crazy how much misleading information is out there, many people are sharing it and nobody is taking responsibility for it. In addition, there could be a discussion in which only verified users (real people) could have access to the press's online chat/discussion under the reported topic.	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech
__label__noRel	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration.
__label__noRel	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. NGOs organize, finance, and promote migration to get advantages.	The demographic decline should be stopped.
__label__noRel	Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__noRel	Sustainable development and climate change mitigation in EU Trade deals should be examples of best practices of EU policy.	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU
__label__noRel	To prevent precarious conditions, we must put in place quality standards, they must be binding for all jobs created under EU and National recovery plans. Better monitoring and trade union involvement are needed to assess and report youth unemployment and NEET rates. At the moment these numbers hide forced mobility, involuntary part-time employment, and work in a grey and informal economy. Urgent measures are needed to fight youth unemployment and precarious working conditions in sectors where young people are overrepresented (tourism; gig economy...).	We should limit the number of plastic types used for packaging
__label__noRel	Eventually, the best solution would be a world wide agreement (as within OECD and like minded) such as the global minimum tax rate.	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__noRel	It's also important to remember that many people use these psychedelic medicines in the context of their own religious/spiritual practice, and therefore our draconic laws directly violate freedom of religion (and sovereignty over our own bodies). There's no way the EU should tolerate this if they really care about human rights.	Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond
__label__noRel	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.
__label__noRel	Ukraine is infamous for its black market for weapons. Helping Ukraine by dumping weapons into such a country is folly.	Germany should start paying reparations share for any damaged countries of Europe up to 100 years after its attack on international society
__label__noRel	Halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU.	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU
__label__noRel	Several member states have been turned into dictatorships a year ago, and there is no sign of a return to democracy. Freezing temporarily their EU membership status is to be considered to those where there is no more freedom in crossing borders (BE), even inside borders (DE, FR), no more press freedom (most), no more debate (most), no more press or individual liberty.	We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states
__label__noRel	The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used in the aviation sector right now. SAFs are not made from fossil fuels, but from CO2 that has been taken out of the air recently, either by biological processes or through technology.	We should stop integration.
__label__noRel	Multiculturalism will enhance our society.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate. So people actually have to come to the EU and enter the EU if they want to ask for asylum in the EU. This has caused inhumane and dangerous circumstances as we see in the Mediterranean Sea.	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy
__label__noRel	The political composition of the European Council - and therefore the EU’s political center of gravity - continuously changes during the EU political cycle, thus preventing clearer government majorities to emerge within these two European Councils.	We should end mass migration together.
__label__noRel	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!	We need better ways of migration.
__label__noRel	Ensure equal opportunities for girls and women, provide them sufficient maternity leave, and institute guarantees that will protect women's careers who choose to have children. Those are the steps we need, and most EU countries already have them (not that they cannot be improved). There's absolutely no need for quotas.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__noRel	Building walls is a sign of fear and weakness.	Every young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least
__label__noRel	The cohesion funds have become a mechanism for local oligarchs and political elites to maintain their power and influence within national contexts, thus resulting in utilizing EU funds for their own personal or political gains and withholding the benefits from the people in cities and regions.	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__noRel	Multiculturalism will enhance our society.	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need.
__label__noRel	The right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, but unfortunately it's framed as a British/brexit issue. However, the wider concept of a common EU visa / migration system is a compelling one. Harmonising the system to a common visa regime offers many advantages.	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__noRel	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__noRel	Every nation with its own language and culture, which demands the same status as a sovereign nation within Europe, must have the right to be recognized and respected by people and other member nations/states.	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work
__label__noRel	We already have successful programs for students from refugee camps. Enhance that.	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	climate change can only be successfully addressed on a global scale, especially in emerging countries that will be responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions in a few decades otherwise. But to convince them to grow green we have to acknowledge that we are denying them the way to build their economy as we did in the past 200 years. So we must support emerging countries in their transition to a green economy.	The European Union shall guarantee its territorial integrity against threats from Russia and shall seek to eliminate the influence of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe.
__label__noRel	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	There should be better EU relations with Russia
__label__noRel	Europe can no longer afford to neglect to defend its external borders and promote policies that favor illegal migration and fuel human trafficking. Strong and effective borders are the pre-condition to any aspect of a common migration policy.	We should end mass migration together.
__label__noRel	And not just the batteries. The EU should have an overall policy with a clear goal to restrict and reduce planned obsolescence.	We should decriminalize drug use
__label__noRel	Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the greatest existential threat to the EU. Even more so than the CO2 threat.	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__noRel	Synchronizing national elections would allow European citizens to engage in major pan-European campaigns.	We should ban wild animals in circuses
__label__noRel	Norway and Iceland can provide their external point of view toward EU policy at the conference. But why only Norway and Iceland? Why not Switzerland? Why not the recognized candidates? And maybe even UK! I'm sure there are many lessons to learn from their experience in the EU and from the Brexit	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__noRel	Turkey is an enemy. It uses this deal to make a threat. Stop it now and send patrols to the Greek border or welcome them.	Imprisonment of foreign criminals should be carried out in their country
__label__noRel	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.	Europe should protect bees
__label__noRel	Europe must stay Europe and people must not be imposed a cultural and religious change they do not want and which is insane. Look at what the Arabic or north African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islam.	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__noRel	European citizens are the future of Europe!	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__noRel	Instead we need to change our behavior, reduce our consumerism and decrease our overall resource use per person.	The Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept.
__label__noRel	For a better migration policy, a European mission could be created to welcome migrants from the coasts of Libya and Tunisia. People welcomed in the centers in North Africa will be re-distributed to the countries of the Union. Are you insane?	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__noRel	climate models (e.g. CO2 affecting anthropogenic climate warming) have not been validated.	We need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy.
__label__noRel	The environmental impact of a given product should also be stated on its package and/or in menus in order to raise awareness on the subject.	We should promote mental health
__label__noRel	Fear of the unknown is normal behavior. It has saved our race since ages starting when mankind was a simple monkey among others.	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__noRel	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights.	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration.
__label__noRel	It's the same with citizens of the USA using Americans to describe themselves. Yes, technically it isn't correct, but who cares...	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good
__label__noRel	Nonsense. Mass migration is a crime against humanity. Endorse this idea: No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU
__label__noRel	We are still living in a capitalism, so, the price will decide and the price of nuclear energy is the only energy price which is increasing steadily, while renewables become cheaper every year. Nuclear was always only subsidiesed by governments and never really standing on their own. The building process is slow, the price is high, no way, this could be a gain - if it weren't for the military.	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans
__label__noRel	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools
__label__noRel	Subsidies often make farmers in recipient countries uncompetitive, hampering local production and increasing migratory pressure.	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law
__label__noRel	Psychedelic medicines specifically have the potential to radically transform our mental health care.	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__noRel	It is unacceptable. Every nation has the right to organize its own prosecution system and no foreign prosecutor should be allowed to operate in independent states, it is a threat to the sovereignty of the member states.	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__noRel	Fish are sentient and failure to afford them the same legal protections that we provide other animals is a gross moral and legal oversight.	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism
__label__noRel	Transparency is the first key to real democracy. Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings. Or think about all the meetings between diplomats (Coreper) and civil servants (working groups and committees), where ±90% of decisions are made, for the Council to be rubberstamped. Meetings that most citizens don't even know about.	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe
__label__noRel	Norway and Iceland can provide their external point of view toward EU policy at the conference. But why only Norway and Iceland? Why not Switzerland? Why not the recognized candidates? And maybe even UK! I'm sure there are many lessons to learn from their experience in the EU and from the Brexit	We should consider Russian interests in the EU policy.
__label__noRel	Europe must be a place that follows science, and following science nuclear power is an important tool in our fight against climate change.	We need a single immigration policy.
__label__noRel	Facial recognition can and will be used against each of us by governments and corporations, based on who we are and what we look like. It will create societies of fear, anxiety, and suspicion.	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	Just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__noRel	Halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU.	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.
__label__noRel	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime!	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles
__label__noRel	Integrating one non-western immigrant cost ca. Euro 167,000,-. Who will be paying that ?	We should reduce animal farming.
__label__noRel	As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare
__label__noRel	The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used in the aviation sector right now.

We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology
__label__noRel	Africa and the Middle East have the highest birthrate in the World. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1,55. It is this high birthrate that keeps them poor. There is almost nothing the EU can do about it.	Europe should stand together!
__label__noRel	Both, a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism are overdue.	We do not want illegal migration.
__label__noRel	Giving immigrants more rights will lead to the forced displacement and eventual erasure of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what's happening to the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China is genocide then so is this. This idea proposal is not grassroots, it's astroturfed lies to hide the fact that our migration policies are totally undemocratic and forced onto native Europeans.	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses
__label__noRel	I am happy to see that the ide of haling all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is still going strong. This message needs to be communicated to Brussels very clearly.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate. So people actually have to come to the EU and enter the EU if they want to ask for asylum in the EU. This has caused inhumane and dangerous circumstances as we see in the Mediterranean Sea.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__noRel	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__noRel	National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success. We need to be united, aligned, and, above all, independent from any extra-EU hegemon!	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	The EURO has been a disaster. It has impoverished the EU and turned the EU into a fighting Union.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__noRel	The key to successful immigration depends upon the possibility of employment. So EU members are to decide whom they want to admit.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
__label__noRel	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.	We should create a European Wealth Fund
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, in our society, a healthy person is not profitable. Pharma is a big business, doctors are being paid for prescribing drugs. Modern healthcare should be preventive. Doctors should be encouraged and paid for curing people and keeping them healthy. Good quality healthcare should be accessible in every part of the world and should be free as there is nothing more important than human life.	We should invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability. It only requires a person's higher capacity to be compassionate, respectful and most of all dedicated to our environment's needs. Who wouldn't want such qualities to become our society's norm?	We need Integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	Immigrants from non-European countries are also growing old.	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__noRel	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU. The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU. Almost all people are without a useful education. There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.	We should support short-distance economies
__label__noRel	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration.
__label__noRel	Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!	We should take polyester and other toxic substances out of clothing and place them with natural materials
__label__noRel	The more dynamic the economy, the stronger the innovation and worldwide influence the EU will have, including soft power.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__noRel	More illegal and legal migration will lead to more unemployment, lower wages, more insecurity, and less sustainable social systems.	EU citizens should be allowed to direct vote for more decisions
__label__noRel	nuclear power plants which, compared to fossil fuel-fired power plants, have decreased carbon dioxide emissions and produce incomparably less toxic substances, which, moreover, are not emitted into the air we breathe, but can be buried deep underground where they will not harm anyone.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__noRel	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__noRel	The EU should support democracies rather than dictatorships and value the support of democracy over economic gains.	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy
__label__noRel	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should also be dragged in front of the court for not taking the illegals to the closest safe port. In 90% of the cases, the closest port lies in Africa.	We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.
__label__noRel	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas. If these young people create for example remote learning opportunities for African students, we should not only sponsor such projects but make exchange possible for young people in Europe to create similar items for example to foster MINT skills throughout Europe. Give more opportunities for young people from both sides to meet, exchange, and ventilate new ideas.	We should build a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network
__label__noRel	I agree, no one should migrate to a country if they're going to commit a crime.	There should be a stronger EU on the world scene
__label__noRel	We live in the XXI century. We do not want any repression of peripheries by their state center. Within the European Union, we should welcome the blessing of decentralism and localism, including the self-determination of stateless peoples and stronger autonomies within confederal agreements. If not in Europe, where? If not now, when?	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__noRel	We certainly need levels of government at the global, regional, and local levels. Equally, we absolutely need democracy at the global, regional, and local levels. Neither the European nor the national and regional parliaments should be abolished because of the need for global governance for the planet.	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
__label__noRel	If all costs, including CO2 emissions of the production, the extraction of resources and its consequences for the region (environment and humans), ecosystem damage, recycling of the waste, and so on and so forth would be monetized and internalized in the costs of the products, many of our problems would be solved. It would simply make the more environmentally friendly products cheaper than the others and their production economically smarter.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__noRel	'People highlight various risks, but any generation technology comes with risks: the largest electricity-related disaster (Banquiao dam in 1976) took the lives of 200000 people (!) or just recently 70 people in Russia, but nobody talks about hydropower being 'deadly' or complaining about states providing insurance for such massive projects, because it happens for all projects of such scale.

__label__noRel	There is no generation technology that comes with zero risks, and this is why we need to look at objective scientific indicators.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	Paying taxes is not enough, if you want to become a citizen with full rights you need to fully embrace the country you live in.	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__noRel	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.	We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses
__label__noRel	In a democracy, people have the right to decide on any issue that affects their lives. If more than half of the inhabitants of a region want to form an independent state, they have the right to do so. Going against it is going against the will of the majority of citizens, and therefore, against the very essence of democracy.	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.
__label__noRel	Eurocrats must learn to act within the space afforded them by the European Treaties. Their grandstanding and theatrics are counterproductive	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing
__label__noRel	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.

Freezing temporarily their EU membership status is to be considered to those where there is no more freedom in crossing borders (BE), even inside borders (DE, FR), no more press freedom (most), no more debate (most), no more press or individual liberty.	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
__label__noRel	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values.

We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports
__label__noRel	The use and promotion of civic technology contribute to a more inclusive, resident-focused urban co-governance model and build ecosystems rich in creativity and innovation, thanks to the diversity of users and perspectives that are at stake.

The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__noRel	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	Europe should have stronger borders

International cooperation with third countries in the field of migration should be developed
__label__noRel	Compared to most anglophone countries, Europe has been quite timid in attracting talent across the globe. Too few people know of and make use of the EU Blue Card.

__label__noRel	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix.

So we must support emerging countries in their transition to a green economy.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__noRel	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations.

The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens

We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__noRel	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this.	We need stricter and homogeneous environmental legislation across the EU

Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off.

Sweden's Stockholm has become the Rape Capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has skyrocketed as well in that country. France is bordering on civil war, whole territories are not under state control anymore. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely.

__label__noRel	We should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.	There should be better EU relations with Russia

__label__noRel	Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions. Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe. The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable!	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.

When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices.

__label__noRel	No person should really earn an income from owning land itself, because it is not the result of human labor. Planet Earth is the common inheritance of humanity, why should any human have the right to take a piece of ground and demand payment from someone else for the privilege of using it? The land exists independently of the land owner.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__noRel	In order to strengthen democracy in the EU, Council meetings should be open to the public and the press. Only in open Council meetings are the Ministers of the Member States forced to clearly state the national interests they can vouch for in relation to their national partners and Voters. Together with the European Parliament, it focuses on an open political debate and decision-making process.	The European Union should hold a referendum to decide on immigration
__label__noRel	The subsidies were originally intended to ensure the security of supply for the European population. But when you export subsidized food, it's at the expense of European taxpayers. Export yes, but then no more subsidies for these products.	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__noRel	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.	We should criminalize the export of waste

__label__noRel	A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations, and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide.	We should restrict immigration.
__label__noRel	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.	We should limit the number of plastic types used for packaging

The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details.	The 9th of May (Europe Day) should be a national holiday
__label__noRel	I fully agree that people should not be incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses. Drug addiction should be treated as a health issue. Drug addicts need help. Incarceration does not help them.	Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond
__label__noRel	In Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal feed. In determining how much subsidy a holding receives, the area of the holding is decisive. In other words, a lot of land, a large amount of subsidy. This results in cheap animal feed and, ultimately, intensive livestock farming. Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.	We should promote mental health

__label__noRel	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution.

__label__noRel	We have millions of poor true Europeans that we can help, why help migrant who have nothing in common with us?	We should remove illegal immigrants.
__label__noRel	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive.	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain

__label__noRel	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU. The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU. Almost all people are without a useful education. There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration.	The EU should ensure a free, independent, and functioning judiciary in its Member States
__label__noRel	The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness
__label__noRel	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability.

We should ban domestic air traffic
__label__noRel	People are willing to volunteer change in relation to involuntary inflicted changes, such as technology, economy, and climate.

__label__noRel	The European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides. And as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are doing constantly dividing work between member states.

__label__noRel	The European Union is not a country and we must respect other countries' electoral choices.	Europe should stand together!
__label__noRel	The EU has no business 'promoting democracy' anywhere beyond its borders. Have we not seen sufficiently clearly in the past two decades where 'democracy export' leads?! Freedom bombs and human suffering everywhere. No, the EU must fully respect the sovereignty and national characters of all nations of this world. And that includes its own member states. The EU must immediately return to the letter of the EU treaties, and reaffirm in the strongest term the principles of conferral and subsidiarity.	We need a revision of the current asylum policy in the European Union.

__label__noRel	Esperanto should be promoted as an international lingua franca. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of cross-cultural communication, allowing high degrees of inclusion.	We should preserve European culture
__label__noRel	The EU cannot endlessly lean on America or NATO. America has proven to be fickle and NATO has its own problems, such as Turkey, which is outside the EU and has threatened Greece. The EU needs its own independent solution.	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
__label__noRel	The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter. The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	Fish are sentient and failure to afford them the same legal protections that we provide other animals is a gross moral and legal oversight.	We should further develop robotization
__label__noRel	Mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.	We should make living wages a human right
__label__noRel	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU
__label__noRel	Agreed, BUT only on one condition: that every euro be spent under the joint control of local and European officers. There's so much corruption in Africa that otherwise of every 100 euros sent there, at least 80 would end up in the pockets of corrupt officers. And in that case, it's better to not send anything.

That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today. At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear. Not much of a future for the young Europeans.	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
__label__noRel	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity.

It’s democratic: There are no native speakers of Esperanto, or better yet not any monolingual speakers of Esperanto. Everyone has to learn it as a second language. As a result of this nobody will have an advantage over others and nobody can feel like a 'stranger' since nobody can feel like a 'native'. Everyone is respected regardless of their origin and not discouraged from learning the language.	We should criminalize the export of waste

__label__noRel	I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.

__label__noRel	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.	Frontex should regularly publish transparency reports
__label__noRel	most of the electric power is produced by thermal power plants that burn oil derivatives and by the nuclear industry.

__label__noRel	We should focus more on human welfare. Currently, waste sorting and recycling are degrading human exploitation in sweatshops.	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__noRel	We pay taxes and we have the right to see where our money goes. It’s very easy to implement through an online platform same as digital banking, but for the state.

__label__noRel	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts.	The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees
__label__noRel	The pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves. We saw patients in very critical condition being moved away from their families from one Member State to another to receive treatment while allowing the doctors to move would be much more efficient and less life-threatening for the patients.

__label__noRel	We should focus more on human welfare. Currently, waste sorting and recycling are degrading human exploitation in sweatshops.	The EU should synchronize national elections

__label__noRel	All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.

__label__noRel	We have already done great damage to EU credibility by pointless posturing.	We need stricter and homogeneous environmental legislation across the EU
__label__noRel	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.	The demographic decline should be stopped.
__label__noRel	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values. They bring crime, terror, and chaos. And after all, if there are no more Europeans in Europe, then what will happen to our beloved continent?	We should promote mental health
__label__noRel	Illegal mass migration is a tragedy. Those who organize and direct mass migration are guilty of a crime against Humanity. Soros and Lukashenka are prime examples of such criminals.	Political institutions should make fundamental changes in the way they address climate change and environmental protection
__label__noRel	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.	The EU leadership must enter into strong agreements with the countries where immigrants come from, in order to retain them in their countries
__label__noRel	The protection of fundamental and human rights, decent work, and the high quality of public services for all must be an integral part of trade and investment policy reform.	We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians
__label__noRel	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists
__label__noRel	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all! Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world. Radioactive rain - cool ;-)	We need a combined education and migration policy for Africa and the Middle East.
__label__noRel	It's by no means irrelevant what kind of cars people use; 25% renewable + 25% nuclear + 50% combustible is better than 100% combustible gasoline.	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__noRel	The standardized retirement age would not only be fairer in an open market, but it would also (and even more so in the future) prevent any complexities with being paid their retirement for those who have made their contributions in different Member States throughout their lives. Even though there is to be at least a central system for this (a step in the right direction), one will only receive a share of one's retirement from a particular Member State once one reaches the retirement age of that Member State.	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good
__label__noRel	The European Commission’sportrays migration as an opportunity only, a Fatality that cannot be stopped, and the only solution against aging.	We should invest in integrated photovoltaic (e.g., over agriculturally used land)
__label__noRel	Lately, the EU has appeared weak and non-organized. For example, we have had no joint policy on how to handle the pandemic. Actions to deal with various problems often come too late. You cannot discuss solutions for years, which requires urgent action.	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration.
__label__noRel	The EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off.	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare
__label__noRel	I disagree, each country must be sovereign to establish its migration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.

__label__noRel	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__noRel	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	I fully agree that people should not be incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses. Drug addiction should be treated as a health issue. Drug addicts need help. Incarceration does not help them.	We need to build up European Defence while remaining in NATO
__label__noRel	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__noRel	We do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices. Innovation is failing and the best we can do is defend the status quo and the old people in power.	The EU should promote organizations that teach the national language via Esperanto
__label__noRel	Many countries have the view that unauthorized asylum seekers should be removed.	We need to invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Juridical protection of dignity, right to life, and integrity of every human being from conception are of fundamental importance for the future of Europe. The dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle vs Greenpeace case, which recalls the definition of the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit that presuppose the destruction of human embryos.	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__noRel	The EU needs to focus on simplifying and standardizing European processes and procedures associated with public management and creating efficient and effective anti-corruption mechanisms. This will reduce the financial resources to be made available to the most relevant areas of intervention at the EU, country, and regional Levels.	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles
__label__noRel	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.	We need legal ways of migration.
__label__noRel	National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success. We need to be united, aligned, and, above all, independent from any extra-EU hegemon!	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__noRel	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters
__label__noRel	Raising prices in the energy sector cannot be the solution in the fight against climate change. The European Commission allows international firms to increase their prices, and as a result, household costs are rising at an incredible rate. The EU should definitely revoke these decisions, and instead of placing the burden on its own citizens, it should instead support them to lead a more sustainable way of life. The green transition should not be a heavy burden borne on the average citizen’s shoulders	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.	Europe should protect bees
__label__noRel	Multiculturalism will enhance our society.	We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender
__label__noRel	As EU citizens we should never forget how privileged we are, and that we bear a human obligation to help others in need.	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration.
__label__noRel	I agree. Young people should have a voice in policymaking. Regulation needs to reduce forms of precarious work. It is time to expand collective bargaining coverage to all forms of work. It is essential to introduce a right to decent housing and policies capping rents and limiting property market speculation. we urgently need investment to achieve this. Youth is the future, we have to take care of it.	We need a better EU migration policy
__label__noRel	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness
__label__noRel	Paying taxes is not enough, if you want to become a citizen with full rights you need to fully embrace the country you live in.	The European Union should hold a referendum to decide on immigration
__label__noRel	Europe should choose a common language. This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language.	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__noRel	Synchronizing national elections would allow European citizens to engage in major pan-European campaigns.	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__noRel	The EU could play an important role in combatting misconceptions about immigration. Immigration needs to be controlled sensibly and immigrants should be taught European values and principles as well as the language of the host country.	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need.
__label__noRel	I understand your point and its importance, but as long as I have fangs in my mouth I will want to eat meat (like most people). You'd be better off suggesting more research into food printers.	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__noRel	This is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.	People from radical Muslim countries should be banned from entering the EU countries
__label__noRel	Quotas are always disgusting examples of oppression and evil. I don't want anything of that, I want freedom and free choice.	Ideology should be aimed at popularizing the best human qualities and stopping everything that is directed against a human
__label__noRel	Youth is a minority that will face the negative effects of climate change without being able to sufficiently participate in climate governance.	Voting for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory
__label__noRel	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers. The EU is a necessity that is comparable with the worker's unions in the 1800 industrialization. Therefore the EU has to decide what role it wants to play in this coming world order.	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__noRel	This will relieve the European prison system. This would encourage many migrants to take responsibility for the laws of the host countries.	EU institutions should prioritize the struggle against all forms of racism, also anti-Muslim bigotry, and antisemitism
__label__noRel	EU lacks a common language for its citizens, which would be easy to manage for all citizens and strengthen a sense of belonging, a common European identity while preserving their national identities.	We should adopt an extension of the application of qualified majority voting arrangements
__label__noRel	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels.	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	Creating a European Wealth Fund will help to foster European growth and unity.	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.
__label__noRel	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.	Climate neutrality can be achieved only by nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Every human being has a conscience that allows them to recognize what is true and what is good, and it is by virtue of this awareness that we demand that no European Union funds be allocated to activities that destroy human embryos.	We should invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	The rule of law varies from country to country, due to the fact that the concept developed in each country under the influence of local traditions. It's impossible, and superfluous to develop a uniform, EU-standard conception of the rule of law.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.	We should promote a plant-based diet
__label__noRel	I guess that after the recent Russian attack on Ukraine, the idea of the EU defense and the army seems much more feasible and convenient.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__noRel	Refugees can obtain a visa at an Embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within a week of arrival.	There should be centers of excellence in science and education
__label__noRel	This just seems like an overtly emotional suggestion that isn't too well thought out. It would cause far more problems that it solves.	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy
__label__noRel	Illegal loopholes in the legislation are enabling illegal migration. Family Reunification has been and remains the biggest channel of migration into the EU.	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform
__label__noRel	Give those who want to come a fair & secure possibility to do so & send those back who really damage your society. Give training, support, opportunities. My guess is that most will pay back with their contributions.	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__noRel	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	Europe must help Ukraine
__label__noRel	The key to successful immigration depends upon the possibility of employment. So EU members are to decide whom they want to admit.	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.
__label__noRel	A common broadcasting license would have an effect on the EU countries experiencing democratic backsliding	We need legal ways of migration.
__label__noRel	The current subsidies with a modular system of incentives should be replaced, as that empowers farmers to choose environmentally, socially, and financially responsible and sustainable solutions that are already available - like natural sequence farming, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, etc.	We should introduce a European citizenship
__label__noRel	Including young people in decision-making processes considering climate change could potentially help to address the gap between the widespread official rhetoric claiming a great interest in involving young people in discussion and policymaking when it comes to climate protection and politics in general and the reality that falls too often too short of these declarations.	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector
__label__noRel	Youth is a minority that will face the negative effects of climate change without being able to sufficiently participate in climate governance.	We should adopt an extension of the application of qualified majority voting arrangements
__label__noRel	By focusing on the well-being of people, particularly disenfranchised people, the EU can arrive at a more complete and sustainable vision of global peace and prosperity.	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.	The EU must be confederal and not federal
__label__noRel	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.	We should take polyester and other toxic substances out of clothing and place them with natural materials
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. It is only transitional. We have good conditions for sustainable green energy (solar, wind, hydro, bio-methane and their combinations).	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU
__label__noRel	I recently read that especially African families tend to send their smartest, best educated youngsters abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their home countries and for our future. We need skilled & educated people in many sectors, but sends such people back to their home countries, because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__noRel	This is a huge discrimination. Everyone should have the chance to develop to a personal level. Or should we all do an IQ-test to stay in our country? Because it could avoid dangerous things like rasicm.	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.
__label__noRel	The broadcasting license on the European level can project European soft power beyond its borders.	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health

__label__noRel	Migrants willingly risk their lives.	We should be aware of migration due to climate change
__label__noRel	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us.	We should put a higher tax or a toll on imported meat from abroad.
__label__noRel	The European Union should be a haven of togetherness and humanity.	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU
__label__noRel	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.	We should preserve European culture
__label__noRel	Lately, the EU has appeared weak and non-organized. For example, we have had no joint policy on how to handle the pandemic. Actions to deal with various problems often come too late. You cannot discuss solutions for years, which requires urgent action.	We should stop hosting migrants from Muslim countries
__label__noRel	If we continue investing in climate and environmentally damaging, regressive, and immensely expensive nuclear power plants or technologies is a mockery of the world and a waste of money and time that we can use for sustainable investments and transformations.	We should stop subsidizing mass livestock farms
__label__noRel	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__noRel	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.	Europe should stand together!

__label__noRel	Integration and immigration in a host country require a lot of effort	The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe
__label__noRel	Decision-making is today made unilaterally minding short-term economic interests and employers' demands. We need a social, progressive policy in the EU.	We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines
__label__noRel	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.	There should be no illegal migration
__label__noRel	The language barrier and a weak influence on local thinking, allow local propaganda to pass on distorted and untrue information about what is happening in the EU to their citizens. Local governments have easy work to appropriate the positive things that the EU has achieved and, conversely, seduce its own failure on 'European bureaucracy'.	The EU should have common taxation and social policy
__label__noRel	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener. In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.	We should prohibit certain energy-intensive cryptocurrencies
__label__noRel	EU lacks a common language for its citizens, which would be easy to manage for all citizens and strengthen a sense of belonging, a common European identity while preserving their national identities.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__noRel	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	We should create a pan-European train company
__label__noRel	Europe can no longer afford to neglect to defend its external borders and promote policies that favor illegal migration and fuel human trafficking. Strong and effective borders are the pre-condition to any aspect of a common migration policy.	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Having to replace an entire mobile phone (or tablet, camera, notebook, etc.) because a battery reached the end of its useful life is infuriating. It is not just a strain on consumers' wallets, it is also devastating for the environment, as the energy and resources going into manufacture of electronics is artificially increased through the short lifespans these devices have.	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.
__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece.	Catalan should be an official language of the European Parliament
__label__noRel	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.	We should make pushbacks legal

__label__noRel	Waste produces negative environmental impacts in the recipient state.	We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states
__label__noRel	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely.	There should be a single EU policy.
__label__noRel	When you see young Ukrainians dying for the EU and its values during Euromaidan, you have no choice but to accept that Ukraine has chosen Europe. If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. We must deepen our relations with Ukraine and prepare to make it a candidate for membership. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia.	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable
__label__noRel	But also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...	Catalan should be an official language of the European Parliament
__label__noRel	We should never ever allow any nuclear power after Fukushima!	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency

__label__noRel	We are still living in a capitalism, so, the price will decide and the price of nuclear energy is the only energy price which is increasing steadily, while renewables become cheaper every year. Nuclear was always only subsidiesed by governments and never really standing on their own. The building process is slow, the price is high, no way, this could be a gain - if it weren't for the military.	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists
__label__noRel	The European Union should be a haven of togetherness and humanity.	EU citizens should be allowed to direct vote for more decisions
__label__noRel	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.	We should make pushbacks legal
__label__noRel	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people. If we manage to be a welcoming continent, the people who come will thank us by being part of society.	We need better ways of migration.

Also, an innumerable amount of people have got significant palliation or even total cure in cases, which the official health care system, unfortunately, couldn't help. This is clearly an area, where countries, civilizations, and schools of thought could learn a lot from each other.	We should preserve bees and polling insects
__label__noRel	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.	Europe should protect bees
__label__noRel	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__noRel	Unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants have no right to be in the country where they are unauthorized.	We should not have illegal immigrants!
__label__noRel	I have never heard anyone talking in Europe about world supremacy. So it seems kind of pointless that this is a goal of EU policy.	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__noRel	The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	We do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices. Innovation is failing and the best we can do is defend the status quo and the old people in power.	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law

__label__noRel	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.

__label__noRel	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!	We should preserve European culture

Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers.

We do not need any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.

__label__noRel	First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making

The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).	We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering
__label__noRel	The EU should attract the world's most talented and most entrepreneurial. There was an attempt to reform the blue card directive by the Junker commission in order to create a new streamlined EU-wide visa category, similar to the short-lived Schengen visa.

__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate. So people actually have to come to the EU and enter the EU if they want to ask for asylum in the EU. This has caused inhumane and dangerous circumstances as we see in the Mediterranean Sea.

__label__noRel	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__noRel	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.

__label__noRel	The EU is not responsible for the entire World.	We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging
__label__noRel	There is enough environmental task to handle and Europe have had its wars. But to streamline our powers and therefore try to save huge amounts of money is a no-brainer.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__noRel	The protection of fundamental and human rights, decent work, and the high quality of public services for all must be an integral part of trade and investment policy reform.	We should fight racism in the EU
__label__noRel	I disagree, each country must be sovereign to establish its migration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.	We should support agroforestry
__label__noRel	This is a huge discrimination. Everyone should have the chance to develop to a personal level. Or should we all do an IQ-test to stay in our country? Because it could avoid dangerous things like rasicm.	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country.
__label__noRel	We must move towards full co-decision power for the European Parliament and the abolition of unanimity for climate, energy, social affairs, and taxation policies.	We should stop hosting migrants from Muslim countries
__label__noRel	In the UK since 2015, there were over 80 PV-related fires, at least 1/4 of which were actually solar panels catching fire, releasing toxic smoke, and contaminating the ground with cadmium.	We should decriminalize drug use
__label__noRel	A federal republic in which all European peoples can live according to their own way of life and identity. Yes, that would help!	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__noRel	The pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves. We saw patients in very critical condition being moved away from their families from one Member State to another to receive treatment while allowing the doctors to move would be much more efficient and less life-threatening for the patients.	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.
__label__noRel	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.	We should be realistic wrt. migration.
__label__noRel	his is the issue in politics and public sector policy making. No objectives are to be pursued. No problems to be solved. I guess it is the nature of the beast. Balancing conflicting interests.	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the costs for EU taxpayers to handle asylum seekers are reduced.	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes
__label__noRel	Immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration.	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced. When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed
__label__noRel	Europe was composed of 13 countries in 1870 and 23 in 1914. Maybe it's time to change borders without bloodshed.	We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__noRel	Agreed. Only if we show that criminals don't have a place in the EU, we can convince our citizens that refugees aren't that much of a threat. Making the checking process that each refugee has to go through public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can just come here and we need to close our borders.	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare
__label__noRel	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__noRel	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell.	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035

__label__noRel	Refugees want to find a safe place in order to live. People are HUMAN.	We need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto.
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable. According to the researchers at RethinkX, we will see a clean energy disruption in the next ten years which will leave investments in oil, coal and nuclear stranded.	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.
__label__noRel	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society.
__label__noRel	Today, cannabis repression is simply a political posture aimed to target rightwing voters, not a rational policy.	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__noRel	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.	We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering
__label__noRel	This will create conditions for the development and education of a Human with a capital “H”, cultivating moral values in each person and society. We should prohibit propaganda of violence, condemnation, and denunciation of any form of division, aggression, and anti-humane manifestations	The EU should strengthen development cooperation.
__label__noRel	The only meaningful immigration is when there is a member country with a specific vacancy. That member will also be responsible for the integration (at a cost of Euro 167,000). The EU has only to administer the paperwork and supervise if matters spin out of control.	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__noRel	Why can't Arab countries shelter refugees from other Arab countries? Same habits, religion and they have enough wealth.	There should be a single EU policy.
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. We have some conditions for sustainable green energy (at least solar, wind, biomethane etc.).	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy
__label__noRel	When you see young Ukrainians dying for the EU and its values during Euromaidan, you have no choice but to accept that Ukraine has chosen Europe. If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. We must deepen our relations with Ukraine and prepare to make it a candidate for membership. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia.	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees
__label__noRel	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop, With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today.	The Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept.
__label__noRel	This will relieve the European prison system. This would encourage many migrants to take responsibility for the laws of the host countries.	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries
__label__noRel	Helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country they are living in are critical to successful integration. Language and norms of the job market and workplace should also be built in.	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans
__label__noRel	Multiculturalism will enhance our society.	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean completely open borders.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__noRel	EU bureaucrats who have enabled immigration must be named and a democratic process for removing them from power must be put into place. Democracy must prevail over this multicultural fascism.	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all! Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world. Radioactive rain - cool ;-)	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	The intention of helping a country with democratization can easily be used to justify violent actions.	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain
__label__noRel	Pragmatism was in the EU’s DNA since its inception, but this is sadly no longer the case. The current EU is not a moral authority, it is a political organization based on mutual interests and political diversity.	We should use available solutions to make flying more sustainable right now
__label__noRel	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries.	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe
__label__noRel	Immigrants from non-European countries are also growing old.	We need to develop partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__noRel	It has been proven in many studies, that immigrants will not cost Europe money but enrich our economy, as well as in so many cultural ways. It will not cost Europe more than the profit they ultimately contribute	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
__label__noRel	Democracy and civilization are the essences of Europe and the EU must uphold those values. For me, the word civilization is also to be civil, which in some way is the opposite of being militarized. The EU should not be a superpower. Nuclear detergence should be enough.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__noRel	For increasing the birthrate and supporting young families, Hungary should be an example. We should not rely on migration for this.	Every human has the right to receive reliable information about the movement and distribution of public funds
__label__noRel	The European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else. An elected head of the Commission would make nonsense of the principle of independence that is vital to the trust in the Commission's job. He or she would be beholden to the group that elected him or her and make the job impossible.	We should prevent the surveillance state
__label__noRel	The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 Frenchman would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own above people whose countries the Americans have bombed to shreds.	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector
__label__noRel	People from several countries are asking for asylum in Europe in hope of better life conditions. Those people aren’t guilty for being born in those countries and EU should support everyone.	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__noRel	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people. It is embedded in the core principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but those high and lofty principles must become a reality for all workers, old and young!	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	High voter turnout is usually desirable, but it's a symptom, not the root cause. Forcing people to go to the polls doesn't mean they will make more informed choices. Besides, voter turnout is a good metric that tells us where the potential problems of voter disenfranchisement are which is the first step to addressing them.	We should decriminalize drug use
__label__noRel	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__noRel	Why do we even let in migrants who do not speak the language of the country where they wish to reside? Migration is bad for the nations and degrading for the migrants. We must work to end mass migration.	The EU should focus on pragmatism
__label__noRel	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.	We should protect 20% of land in each European country to restore biodiversity
__label__noRel	NGOs are often America's way of interfering in European elections. NGOs must be policed more vigilantly to prevent America from interfering in our elections.	We should use the waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain
__label__noRel	As EU citizens we should never forget how privileged we are, and that we bear a human obligation to help others in need.	We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress.	There should be a common EU migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	The EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__noRel	Give those who want to come a fair & secure possibility to do so & send those back who really damage your society. Give training, support, opportunities. My guess is that most will pay back with their contributions.	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__noRel	Very large natural areas need to be protected to promote wildlife and the return of self-sustaining and fertile biodiversity!	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector
__label__noRel	It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.
__label__noRel	If young Europeans are living abroad they will feel racism on their own in the country they are living in.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__noRel	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.	We should improve migration policies
__label__noRel	Migrants willingly risk their lives.	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__noRel	A one-cent coin costs about 60% more to produce than it is actually worth.	We should build more nuclear power plants
__label__noRel	Ukraine is a part of Europe—geographically, diplomatically, and culturally. If Ukraine wants to join the EU, we should grant our brothers and sisters full membership in our Union.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__noRel	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__noRel	taxation seems to be the only real way to incentivize other countries less worried about climate change to work on it	Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the security risks for asylum seekers are greatly reduced.	We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering
__label__noRel	We can work together to encourage plant based diets and make the world a better place.	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__noRel	climate change can only be successfully addressed on a global scale, especially in emerging countries that will be responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions in a few decades otherwise. But to convince them to grow green we have to acknowledge that we are denying them the way to build their economy as we did in the past 200 years. So we must support emerging countries in their transition to a green economy.	We should remove illegal immigrants.
__label__noRel	This is especially true when we know how much alcohol is damaging the brain, in particular in the developing brain of teenagers. Also unlike cannabis, over-consumption of alcohol leads to death so I would say that this product is much more dangerous. Yet unlike cannabis, alcohol is legal.	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, vaccination has shown that it is unable to curb the contagion and therefore the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the EU COVID digital certificate is not able to guarantee the safety for which it was designed, demonstrating that it is primarily a tool of discrimination without real usefulness in containing contagion	We should fight racism in the EU
__label__noRel	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals. It would be good for every person to be given psychotherapeutic advice once a year in order to be able to diagnose and treat mental disorders and illnesses at an early stage or even to prevent them.	There should be 6 concrete proposals for migrants on the Balkan route.
__label__noRel	We must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.	Every young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least
__label__noRel	Mass migration is an evil that hurts the nations as well as the migrants themselves, who suffer indignities and risk their lives. We must end mass migration. This requires that migrants be helped as close to the origin of migration as possible.	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech
__label__noRel	In this case, the service generates profit, not the product.	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__noRel	Too many times so-called leaders around the world like Trump and Boris Johnson have made a mockery of Europe and Europeans with zero response from EU leaders. These things affect people's pride and give out a sense of weakness.	The EU should join NATO
__label__noRel	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels.	The EU should also guarantee territorial integrity against threats from Turkey and other Middle Eastern regional powers.
__label__noRel	Multiculturalism will enhance our society.	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources
__label__noRel	The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used in the aviation sector right now. SAFs are not made from fossil fuels, but from CO2 that has been taken out of the air recently, either by biological processes or through technology.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__noRel	We need to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in centers for repatriation.	We should change corporate accounting rules to include climate change and biodiversity loss
__label__noRel	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.	There is a lack of unity in European migration policies.
__label__noRel	Catalonia must become independent from the Spanish dictatorial repression that tries to end the Catalan language and culture.	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__noRel	We should restrict delocalizing factories to third countries where environmental legislation is softer. We need unique legislation to avoid this.	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__noRel	The root causes to leave their home countries should not be overlooked. The EU and its member states need to increase efforts to make the countries of origin more liveable.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__noRel	Esperanto is politically neutral: it is not used by any European nation. Although there is some culture connected to the language, there is no political or economic power imposing it. Also, where English is connected to the US, Canada, Australia, and other countries, Esperanto would be a truly European language.	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	The NGOs are committing the EXACT same crime Lukashenko is guilty of: Organizing mass migration and directing it toward Europe is aggression and an act of hybrid warfare.	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law
__label__noRel	I agree. Stable, quality jobs and adequate social protection for everyone are necessary. Trade unions have many proposals to achieve more equal and inclusive labor markets. This goes hand in hand with policies to promote more equal, sustainable, and inclusive societies.	The EU should strengthen development cooperation.
__label__noRel	Discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.	The EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it
__label__noRel	Exported trash is burning for months suffocating local people and wildlife.	We need a common EU TV channel free of charge for people in all Member States
__label__noRel	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers. The EU is a necessity that is comparable with the worker's unions in the 1800 industrialization. Therefore the EU has to decide what role it wants to play in this coming world order.	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__noRel	Europe as a whole is the world’s leading donor. The European Union should strengthen the development cooperation action, focusing on inclusive development	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__noRel	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it. We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control. I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic.	Wind and solar energy resources are a commodity, provided by big companies.
__label__noRel	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__noRel	EU must take action. Help those in need, but only those who respect legal boundaries. Mutual respect is a cornerstone in this subject where we must set limits to protect Europe.	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.
__label__noRel	This is the only way that European values and democracies can survive the challenges ahead of us. Europe has two kinds of countries: small countries and small countries that haven't realised they are small yet. If we want to protect European sovereignty we need to keep integrating. The other option is to sell our countries to China and Russia or turn them into American colonies.	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism
__label__noRel	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.	We should stop integration.
__label__noRel	Real democracy cannot do without economic democracy. If the major decisions about our future life (investments, inventions, production) are made outside social control, then there is no real democracy. Without proper social consultation, there is no prospect for a fair Europe.	We should protect 20% of land in each European country to restore biodiversity
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, the values and rights are interpreted and exercised differently in the states of the European Union. Whether we are speaking about minority protection, language rights, or cultural values. We can see every day that the EU is constantly retaliating against the Hungarians in Transylvania, when, despite the legislation in force, it ignores the lawlessness and atrocities committed against the Hungarians as a native minority. Furthermore, the European Union should give priority to all situations in which Hungarians in Transylvania are victims of discrimination.	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from
__label__noRel	The recent crisis on the Polish border only underlines the urgency of this proposal.	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.
__label__noRel	These fuels currently cost 2 to 5 times more than kerosene. Facilitating and multiplying its production will automatically reduce its cost.	We should further develop robotization
__label__noRel	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	Climate neutrality can be achieved only by nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	Catalan should be an official language of the European Parliament
__label__noRel	Having many individuals in the EU paying a voluntary tax can contribute big time to the perceived democratic legitimacy of the EU.	The EU must use its weight as a united global player in trade policy and put an end to foreclosure
__label__noRel	If a veto is happening in the current EU voting procedure it is justified.	We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic
__label__noRel	It is essential that European principles and values are taught to migrants, including an explanation of the reasoning behind these principles and values. It would be best that this is provided both in the person's mother tongue and in the language of the host country.	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
__label__noRel	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__noRel	sustainable fuel is a fraud that allows industrial sectors (in this case airlines) to be compensated for change management they should themselves pay via R&D	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.
__label__noRel	Fear of the unknown is normal behavior. It has saved our race since ages starting when mankind was a simple monkey among others.	The European Union should hold a referendum to decide on immigration
__label__noRel	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy
__label__noRel	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them. We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.	We should have a CO2 Carbon Equivalent Indicator for every product in the market
__label__noRel	The incentive to provide free public transport in European cities in the future would make it easier for people, especially in the cities, to accept and appreciate that there will be fewer and fewer cars. People who benefit from current examples are happy about it.	We need a stand-alone European army.
__label__noRel	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration.	Voting for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory
__label__noRel	Migrants depend on other countries' social systems.	We should establish a Russian interest including EU policy.
__label__noRel	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__noRel	What does it mean to have a mere CO2eq. indicator? That's utter nonsense as there are many more impact categories.	There should be no illegal migration
__label__noRel	Living in Europe is not a human right. Illegal migrants are willing to break a law and risk their lives (and the lives of their families), while unable to undergo the proper legal and established process and paperwork.	We should build a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network
__label__noRel	I am happy to see that the ide of haling all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is still going strong. This message needs to be communicated to Brussels very clearly.	We need a better distribution of refugees
__label__noRel	The European Commission’sportrays migration as an opportunity only, a Fatality that cannot be stopped, and the only solution against aging.	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__noRel	Changing the EU foreign policy voting procedure will cause serious problems.	We should restrict immigration.

__label__noRel	The EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off.	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__noRel	The EU cannot endlessly lean on America or NATO. America has proven to be fickle and NATO has its own problems, such as Turkey, which is outside the EU and has threatened Greece. The EU needs its own independent solution.	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech
__label__noRel	In order to in parallel raise consumer awareness about which products contain microplastics, the EU should introduce a requirement for mandatory labels on packages of products containing microplastics warning consumers of the presence thereof.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__noRel	Education is key. School curricula could help have more responsible consumption.	We should decriminalize drug use
__label__noRel	The European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else.

The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.	We should end animal abuse
__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.	The EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO
__label__noRel	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all! Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world. Radioactive rain - cool ;-)	We should stop making one-cent coins
__label__noRel	In circuses, wild animals in circuses are destined to a life of physical abuse and mental torture.	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__noRel	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.
__label__noRel	I'd like to see inclusive legislation which considers all sorts of social businesses, gives them good protection and possibilities to develop. We need a EU social business lab to help develop, foster and research social businesses.	Europe should have stronger borders
__label__noRel	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__noRel	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.	The EU needs a single market for news
__label__noRel	I agree. Young people should have a voice in policymaking. Regulation needs to reduce forms of precarious work. It is time to expand collective bargaining coverage to all forms of work. It is essential to introduce a right to decent housing and policies capping rents and limiting property market speculation. we urgently need investment to achieve this. Youth is the future, we have to take care of it.	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece.	We do not need any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	Judeo-Christian values are the cornerstone of European civilization - they deserve special protection because they made us who we are today. Mass migration from people with cultures totally alien to Europe is the phenomenon that most threatens EU security and cohesion. Everyone's human rights must be respected, but illegal migrants are criminals and should be treated as such, not pampered. Mass migration must end.	We need a stand-alone European army.
__label__noRel	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex).	We should invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Wood should be used as building material & other meaningful products only. Anything else is a waste of resources. No fresh wood for paper, fast furniture	European citizens want quality of life and are not interested in world supremacy
__label__noRel	Subsidies for meat production and fishery not only have a negative impact on our environment - but they also destroy the economy in poorer countries in Africa! We really should find a way to stop these and get out of this vicious circle!	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.
__label__noRel	The EU needs to both promote and uphold the highest social and environmental standards in its internal as well as external policies. Human rights and collective agreements must never be seen as barriers to trade!	We should protect 20% of land in each European country to restore biodiversity
__label__noRel	Yes, and it should be payed out to every citizen of the EU. Those people with a lower CO2 footprint - typically lower income family - would greatly benefit from it and be incentivized to invest in cleaner energy, heating etc.	We should fight racism in the EU
__label__noRel	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!	The President of the European Commission should be directly elected by direct universal suffrage
__label__noRel	Without bees, which are dying en masse, Europe’s existence is impossible. The problem is complex and it is about the influence of poisonous pesticides and other agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as the influence of GSM technologies, which lead to overheating of the bee’s body, which falls under the negative impact of microwaves. Therefore, Europe must create a series of policies to help bees survive in the name of the surplus of European nations.	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__noRel	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense.	We should put a higher tax or a toll on imported meat from abroad.
__label__noRel	Natural materials have a large carbon footprint. They require fresh water and land, contributing to the pressure on nature and resources around the world.	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools
__label__noRel	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform
__label__noRel	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially article 14, states: 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.'	The European Union, as a Union of values, should limit its support to countries that do not want to adhere to European values and violate the rights of their citizens
__label__noRel	I opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.	The demographic decline should be stopped.
__label__noRel	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__noRel	Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd world countries. This includes fighting for climate justice and decreasing unequal wealth distribution between countries.	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__noRel	Entering the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right to receive asylum.	We should change our consumption habits
__label__noRel	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions. We have the perfectly fine EU Treaties as the foundational documents of the EU. They must be followed to the letter.	Toilet paper should be made of recycled paper only
__label__noRel	It's also important to remember that many people use these psychedelic medicines in the context of their own religious/spiritual practice, and therefore our draconic laws directly violate freedom of religion (and sovereignty over our own bodies). There's no way the EU should tolerate this if they really care about human rights.	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles
__label__noRel	The number of video surveillance and control and intervention rights for public authorities is steadily increasing (at least according to my subjective feeling). This puts our free way of life at risk. A person who feels monitored will never really act freely.	The EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom
__label__noRel	To face future crises – from climate change over cancer to multi-resistant bacteria - we need a strong fundament of open research that will provide the solutions when needed.	The European Union, as a Union of values, should limit its support to countries that do not want to adhere to European values and violate the rights of their citizens
__label__noRel	We must protect our Planet, and without bees, wasps, or other arthropods, we go to our own extinction!	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__noRel	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener. In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.	Businesses should buy unused emissions by reforesting, restoration, or conservation of habitats sequestrating carbon
__label__noRel	This will reduce pollution and make people have better health, while at the same time reducing the impact on their budget and on the environment. What are we waiting for?	We do not want illegal migration.
__label__noRel	Why have several EU passports when they actually represent one and the same thing?	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.	The EU should reduce its influence on its member states.
__label__noRel	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
__label__noRel	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness
__label__noRel	The EU and its member states have already various partnership or neighborhood programs for Non-EU states.	The 19 June plenary meeting of the European Conference should mark a first step in the direction of a stronger and more united EU in the world
__label__noRel	Most of the time migrants have trouble fitting into society because of the language barrier and hate. Providing them with language lessons could reduce the tensions around migration, and improve the migrants' integration.	Europe should change the world for the better for everyone.
__label__noRel	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__noRel	taxation seems to be the only real way to incentivize other countries less worried about climate change to work on it	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__noRel	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU. The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU. Almost all people are without a useful education. There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.	We need better ways of migration.
__label__noRel	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.	We need a stand-alone European army.
__label__noRel	Europe needs a proper parliament including a right to initiative combined with strong involvement of social partners, e.g. through European Social Dialogue or the partnership principle in regional funds.	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__noRel	All refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left.	The EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO
__label__noRel	European political parties should be independent of national parties. There should be primaries open for the citizens to choose the candidate, it would increase citizen participation and involvement in EU politics.	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.
__label__noRel	If the European Council listened to the results of the inquiry made by the European Commission. 'The EU was set to stop changing its clocks in 2021, but then came Brexit, the pandemic, and some messy international bureaucracy'.	The EU leadership must enter into strong agreements with the countries where immigrants come from, in order to retain them in their countries
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the costs for EU taxpayers to handle asylum seekers are reduced.	We do not want illegal migration.
__label__noRel	If you want something like 'increasing the percentage of women in all sectors', you need to create more women or reduce the number of men. I will better not ask questions in this direction.	We should limit the use of fireworks
__label__noRel	Europe must be a place that follows science, and following science nuclear power is an important tool in our fight against climate change.	There should be better EU relations with Russia
__label__noRel	We just need to define the values and laws of our utopia and give people the resources to join together in building it.	There should be no illegal migration.
__label__noRel	Before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have nice conditions in the EU, we should first focus on ensuring that our own people can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.	We need Integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy
__label__noRel	why should every country in the EU be sovereign in energy production? Within the countries also not every region is sovereign in this sense. We need to take advantage of the geographic potentials of the european continent for pragmatic solutions	We should establish a European Army.
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
__label__noRel	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe
__label__noRel	We need to stop all funding to NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. Then can we talk about how to help the people already here and how to help real people in need.	We need better ways of migration.
__label__noRel	The traditional family is the cornerstone of European civilization.	We should invest in R&D
__label__noRel	Giving immigrants more rights will lead to the forced displacement and eventual erasure of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what's happening to the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China is genocide then so is this. This idea proposal is not grassroots, it's astroturfed lies to hide the fact that our migration policies are totally undemocratic and forced onto native Europeans.	We need a better migration policy.
__label__noRel	Subsidies often make farmers in recipient countries uncompetitive, hampering local production and increasing migratory pressure.	We should consider Russian interests in the EU policy.
__label__noRel	The right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law
__label__noRel	Eventually, the best solution would be a world wide agreement (as within OECD and like minded) such as the global minimum tax rate.	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate
__label__noRel	Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.	Voting for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory
__label__noRel	There is a lack of security and defense policy that can realistically be achieved by strengthening the Euro body as the 28th European army.	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy
__label__noRel	This idea is what we have been doing for the last 30 years. It did not produce sufficient results to justify continuing on this path. It is just saying, that problem will solve itself. This proposition is harmful and does not stand on any data that could justify it.	The EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe.
__label__noRel	During the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states. Gathering the strength of the 27 member states in research and health could be a real asset for the EU and its citizens, but also for its influence overseas and its independence.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__noRel	The migrants that are already (legally) here should be taught western values so they and their families can integrate/assimilate, as the age-old saying goes 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'.	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration.
__label__noRel	Too many times so-called leaders around the world like Trump and Boris Johnson have made a mockery of Europe and Europeans with zero response from EU leaders. These things affect people's pride and give out a sense of weakness.	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.
__label__noRel	Will Russia also pay their share? Will Austria pay for starting WW1 or will it be Serbia? Will Poland and Hungary pay for occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia in 1938/1939? Will France pay for starting napoleonic wars? It is time to forget what happened almost 100 years ago and focus on the future and I say that as a Czech citizen whose country was occupied by Austria, Germany/Poland/Hungary and then by SSSR and all eastern satelite states.	There should be a president for the EU elected by the people.
__label__noRel	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__noRel	Europe should look at the European people first. It is not fair for the working classes to have to live within the ruins of multiculturalism while the middle class supports immigration from within their gated communities.	Coronavirus protection should be advertised on TV and social media
__label__noRel	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.	We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries.	We should have all workers working in private enterprises share equity in the company they work for

__label__noRel	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense.	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__noRel	The EU cannot endlessly lean on America or NATO. America has proven to be fickle and NATO has its own problems, such as Turkey, which is outside the EU and has threatened Greece. The EU needs its own independent solution.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__noRel	The cohesion funds have become a mechanism for local oligarchs and political elites to maintain their power and influence within national contexts, thus resulting in utilizing EU funds for their own personal or political gains and withholding the benefits from the people in cities and regions.	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__noRel	Many migrants simply refuse to fight to change things in their own countries. Once a migrant told me 'I want what you have, why should I sweat to build it back in my country when here it's ready to be taken?' No thanks.	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__noRel	A good idea to end online trolls and haters. Easy to set up, it is a very good short-term solution, but fake news, unfortunately, escapes this regulation. So there is a need for other measures to attack the algorithms of the social networks themselves.	The Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept.

The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	I agree, it would agile bureaucracy and it would benefit both citizens and institutions.	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.
__label__noRel	Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest, and not to be discriminated against.	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries
__label__noRel	Changing the EU foreign policy voting procedure will cause serious problems.	EU institutions should prioritize the struggle against all forms of racism, also anti-Muslim bigotry, and antisemitism
__label__noRel	Pooling & Sharing increases the size, availability, the diversity of specific military resources but decreases their global cost at the same time	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities

__label__noRel	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.).	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory

__label__noRel	The EU is not responsible for the entire World.	The EU should extend the model of Pooling & Sharing European military resources beyond air transport.
__label__noRel	Europe has more than enough ideological disputes within its own borders. We must settle those first - by falling back on a previous, more classical liberal position that was uncontroversial for most of our citizens.

We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd world countries. This includes fighting for climate justice and decreasing unequal wealth distribution between countries.	We should stop integration.

__label__noRel	We must support countries that want to improve the welfare and rights of their citizens. If a country wants to join the EU and meets the conditions for joining, the decision to join is solely between the candidate country and the EU.	We should end animal abuse
__label__noRel	Youth is a minority that will face the negative effects of climate change without being able to sufficiently participate in climate governance.	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.
__label__noRel	Through their emphasis on wisdom, social cohesion, and interrelatedness Faith-Based Organizations can show the potential to not only effectively mobilize people on the ground in responding to climate change but more importantly to motivate large sections of society to move from their deep seeded set of core values.	We should make living wages a human right
__label__noRel	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.	The EU must be confederal and not federal
__label__noRel	Including young people in decision-making processes considering climate change could potentially help to address the gap between the widespread official rhetoric claiming a great interest in involving young people in discussion and policymaking when it comes to climate protection and politics in general and the reality that falls too often too short of these declarations.

__label__noRel	Gas power plants produce CO2. Climate-damaging methane is released during extraction and transport, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste - a legacy for future generations - not to mention the current danger of release, e.g. through attacks, geological events, or operational accidents due to human or technical errors.	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.

__label__noRel	Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	We should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.	We need an integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	Europe needs more women to have children and raise them in a good manner, which helps transmit our culture: our culture is a praise to the world and must be saved from globalization invasion and destruction.	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state
__label__noRel	Immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration.	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
__label__noRel	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people.

__label__noRel	Tax should be compulsory, not voluntary! Yes, the EU needs to collect direct taxes!

Together with the European Parliament, it focuses on an open political debate and decision-making process.	We need a better EU migration policy
__label__noRel	Including Russia in our sphere of friendship would allow the EU to discuss certain values from within and coax them toward democracy and change.

__label__noRel	It will bring the EU more jobs, less unemployment, and more added value.	Intensive livestock farming should disappear
__label__noRel	Such a platform if it provides youngsters with free or at least affordable mental-health assistance, will help them finally able to overcome our society’s barriers to taking care of our mental health and emotional well-being.	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU. EU does not equal to Europe
__label__noRel	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	We should stop making one-cent coins
__label__noRel	No science means war, hunger, material, and moral poverty.	We should not subsidize large agricultural groups
__label__noRel	being against solar energy, in my opinion, is simply irrational. Insects also die by windmills sometimes, but much more often from hunger, birds or herbicides, insecticides, etc.	Esperanto should be the common language for the European Union.
__label__noRel	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.	We should have legal migration channels.
__label__noRel	What does it mean to have a mere CO2eq. indicator? That's utter nonsense as there are many more impact categories.	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products
__label__noRel	This should help to tackle the causes of lack of prospects and absconding from these countries in order to increase the willingness of young people to stay in their homes	We should limit the use of fireworks
__label__noRel	Abortion kills a human being. It can be justified only in very rare cases.	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.
__label__noRel	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU
__label__noRel	Yes, the European Union needs effective policies to combat online hate speech and these need to be regularly updated as technology evolves and to take into account worldwide learning on how to effectively combat online hate speech.	We need legal ways of migration.
__label__noRel	Very large natural areas need to be protected to promote wildlife and the return of self-sustaining and fertile biodiversity!	We should ban cryptocurrencies
__label__noRel	The convenience of carrying fewer coins is obvious.	We need stricter and homogeneous environmental legislation across the EU
__label__noRel	Distance is very important when trading. Security is even more important in relation to distance. It is without thought to escalate conflict and it is not in the interest of Europe. Russia has centuries of history with European allies. It is in the interest of Europe to not leave Russia solely to China. We can all prosper.	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy is undoubtedly the best form of electricity production, massive and controllable, with no CO2/GHG emissions.	We should create an EU protocol for UAP reports of personnel employed by airlines and personnel of all armed forces for all member states
__label__noRel	Recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state coordinated act of the EU, USA, Japan, and Australia. That will make any retaliation from China much more difficult.	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law
__label__noRel	The EU should support democracies rather than dictatorships and value the support of democracy over economic gains.	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
__label__noRel	Not many consumers are aware of how many of their products contain microplastics because producers deliberately hide this fact by only referring to the chemical names of microplastics on labels.	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__noRel	The fruit and vegetable sector is able to produce a large quantity of waste products which, if well reused, could be used for animal feed.	We need a common EU TV channel free of charge for people in all Member States
__label__noRel	High voter turnout is usually desirable, but it's a symptom, not the root cause. Forcing people to go to the polls doesn't mean they will make more informed choices. Besides, voter turnout is a good metric that tells us where the potential problems of voter disenfranchisement are which is the first step to addressing them.	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters
__label__noRel	Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good
__label__noRel	According to Mrs. Ngozi Okonjat, African countries follow the example of the Asian Tigers.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__noRel	Integrating an immigrant into the EU is costly.	We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology
__label__noRel	The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used in the aviation sector right now. SAFs are not made from fossil fuels, but from CO2 that has been taken out of the air recently, either by biological processes or through technology.	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__noRel	Immigrants cannot work because they don't speak the required language.	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
__label__noRel	Decision-making is today made unilaterally minding short-term economic interests and employers' demands. We need a social, progressive policy in the EU.	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
__label__noRel	Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__noRel	We must support countries that want to improve the welfare and rights of their citizens. If a country wants to join the EU and meets the conditions for joining, the decision to join is solely between the candidate country and the EU.	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values. They bring crime, terror, and chaos. And after all, if there are no more Europeans in Europe, then what will happen to our beloved continent?	We should put in place policies for the protection of insects
__label__noRel	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.	We should protect the European border
__label__noRel	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council. We have seen this many times when the EU-MS have tried to find a common stance on foreign policy issues but one has been able to deter the will of all the other countries. This is not a democratic way. The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election.	We need Integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society
__label__noRel	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	The EU should strengthen development cooperation.
__label__noRel	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	Pay-as-you-go public health insurance funds should only be used for the most serious illnesses
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the security risks for asylum seekers are greatly reduced.	We should create a pan-European train company
__label__noRel	By focusing on the well-being of people, particularly disenfranchised people, the EU can arrive at a more complete and sustainable vision of global peace and prosperity.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__noRel	Without increased financing of research, we will lack a firm evidence base.	There should be a European Army.
__label__noRel	All of Europe has to pay income tax & VAT, except for the Eurocrats. In Belgium, you have to pay 50 % of your salary to the state, unless you work directly for the EU. Is this fair? No, of course not! It is time to make Europe fairer in a very practical and direct way, by abolishing tax exemptions for European politicians and staff.	There should be 6 concrete proposals for migrants on the Balkan route.
__label__noRel	We can only employ people in understaffed job fields.	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__noRel	Bad governance, unreasonable spending, and corruption are damaging and unsustainable which means, we can't afford to leave them alone if we want to have a future.	We should not have illegal immigrants!
__label__noRel	Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).	We should have a CO2 Carbon Equivalent Indicator for every product in the market
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the costs for EU taxpayers to handle asylum seekers are reduced.	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__noRel	creating a European sustainability tax for all products and services from inside and outside the EU based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations will make all unsustainable products more expensive and sustainable products more competitive	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__noRel	Marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists!	We should stop buying Russian gas
__label__noRel	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely.	Frontex should regularly publish transparency reports
__label__noRel	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__noRel	In this case, the service generates profit, not the product.	The EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it
__label__noRel	Setting up inhumane camps by bribing local warlords is not the right way.	We should increase the salaries of artisans
__label__noRel	It is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	The European Union shall guarantee its territorial integrity against threats from Russia and shall seek to eliminate the influence of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe.
__label__noRel	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.	There should be a stronger EU on the world scene
__label__noRel	Migrants sell drugs.	We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses
__label__noRel	Stop woke ideology introducing Orwellian newspeak!	We should use available solutions to make flying more sustainable right now
__label__noRel	'War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength'... and now censorship is free speech.	We should abolish covid digital pass
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy use helps to avoid the release of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants every year, which contribute to the development of acid rain, smog, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.	We should make living wages a human right
__label__noRel	Anonymity is at least as much as important as Identity. Today it is very easy to be anonymous, but hard to prove the identity of opinion and establish a public web of trust. Anonymity enables powerful identities to control the messages, and therefore the identity-seeking masses.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
__label__noRel	The EU needs to focus on simplifying and standardizing European processes and procedures associated with public management and creating efficient and effective anti-corruption mechanisms. This will reduce the financial resources to be made available to the most relevant areas of intervention at the EU, country, and regional Levels.	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__noRel	This is the only way that European values and democracies can survive the challenges ahead of us. Europe has two kinds of countries: small countries and small countries that haven't realised they are small yet. If we want to protect European sovereignty we need to keep integrating. The other option is to sell our countries to China and Russia or turn them into American colonies.	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa. Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans.	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__noRel	I am concerned about the source of some cotton, which is produced in Chinese detention camps. A unified EU mark of ethical & environmental principles would be a nice thing to have when deciding what to buy.	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
__label__noRel	Recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state coordinated act of the EU, USA, Japan, and Australia. That will make any retaliation from China much more difficult.	Europe should establish a common Army across Europe
__label__noRel	We need to legalize pushbacks as a tool to limit illegal migration.	The EU should ensure a free, independent, and functioning judiciary in its Member States
__label__noRel	The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter. The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality.	We should limit the number of plastic types used for packaging
__label__noRel	Europe’s rapid Islamisation must be stopped. It is, therefore, necessary to stop the illegal migration of African and Asian people who do not fit with European culture.	There should be a single EU policy.
__label__noRel	No science means war, hunger, material, and moral poverty.	We should create a European Wealth Fund
__label__noRel	Makes sense to me, its easy to learn and doesn't come with any nationalist baggage.	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI
__label__noRel	The procedure of Family Reunification is already causing major problems in the USA.	We should ban domestic air traffic
__label__noRel	The EU should be a global actor. Merge all Foreign affairs departments from member states into a coordinated European network for international policy and intelligence.	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country.
__label__noRel	Immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration.	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries
__label__noRel	It shouldn't be the European families who pay for the damage caused by multinational corporations.	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.
__label__noRel	giving nuclear energy a green label will encourage the flow of financial resources across the EU toward environmentally sustainable activities	Migrants should not be used for political blackmail.
__label__noRel	European citizens are the future of Europe!	Political institutions should make fundamental changes in the way they address climate change and environmental protection
__label__noRel	Japan was a global superpower once just behind the USA, however, it has a strict immigration policy. Where is it now in global power rankings?	We need to invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	sustainable fuel is a fraud that allows industrial sectors (in this case airlines) to be compensated for change management they should themselves pay via R&D	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__noRel	Things that are supposed to serve us for a long time, like a vehicle or telecommunication device or household implements should be designed to last half a lifetime under normal use. The quality of the building material should matter more in that instance, so less focus on recycling.	We should abolish Chatcontrol
__label__noRel	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals. It would be good for every person to be given psychotherapeutic advice once a year in order to be able to diagnose and treat mental disorders and illnesses at an early stage or even to prevent them.	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	There has to be a general awareness that the real price of throw-away products and mass-produced foods is paid in the long run and that continuing down the current path will lead to more problems than having to adjust one's consumer behavior.	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare
__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean completely open borders.	We should adopt a single migration policy.
__label__noRel	In order to promote European peace, prosperity, and precious diversity, a different administration system is needed: a federal Europe, based on a democratic federal constitution instead of anarchy-provoking EU treaties.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__noRel	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop, With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today.	We should invest in R&D
__label__noRel	We need to revisit the idea of a defense union that is independent of NATO. National armies of EU states should be able to cooperate. This includes the same equipment, the same training and the same battle language.	We need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto.
__label__noRel	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
__label__noRel	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!	We should promote a culture of exchange and sharing of goods and services
__label__noRel	We see this problem in many countries and the situation is getting worse - the pandemic, also, took its toll. Stable quality jobs and adequate social protection are necessary if we don't want to see a great strain on social systems in the long term.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__noRel	Pooling & Sharing integrates military capabilities at the European level and creates a European culture in the military sector.	We should develop a strategy for the EU defense in relation to NATO
__label__noRel	IQ tests do not prevent ill-intentioned people from entering our borders. Canada aims to receive 400,000 people each year, and how intelligent or skilled they are does not matter. People working in the agricultural fields are being naturalized, relatives are being naturalized.	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy
__label__noRel	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__noRel	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__noRel	The broadcasting license on the European level can project European soft power beyond its borders.	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	The NGOs are committing the EXACT same crime Lukashenko is guilty of: Organizing mass migration and directing it toward Europe is aggression and an act of hybrid warfare.	We should stop buying Russian gas
__label__noRel	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy
__label__noRel	Creating a European Wealth Fund will help to foster European growth and unity.	We should stop mass migration.
__label__noRel	Turkey is an enemy. It uses this deal to make a threat. Stop it now and send patrols to the Greek border or welcome them.	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East.

__label__noRel	Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.	We should invest in integrated photovoltaic (e.g., over agriculturally used land)
__label__noRel	Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest, and not to be discriminated against.	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work
__label__noRel	The EU is established on treaties, but treaties have no soul. Only a constitution has a soul, provided it is well designed: from, by, and for the people.	There should be a stronger EU on the world scene
__label__noRel	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__noRel	This should help to tackle the causes of lack of prospects and absconding from these countries in order to increase the willingness of young people to stay in their homes	Immigrants should integrate through work

The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	Even if you believe you are unable to follow a plant-based lifestyle you must appreciate the effectiveness and dedication to the environment of those individuals who do.	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.
__label__noRel	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.	The President of the European Commission should be directly elected by direct universal suffrage
__label__noRel	Who gets to decide what is 'hate speech'? Should the promotion of feminism be considered hate speech against men, or is only hate speech when you don't agree with someone?	We should ban domestic air traffic
__label__noRel	I think increasing taxes on tobacco could do a similar thing. But then we would also have to increase the contributions to health insurance for people who overeat sugar, use sunbeds, etc., to be fair.	We should invest in sustainable alternative fuels for aviation
__label__noRel	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.	Solar and wind energies have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	Refugees can obtain a visa at an Embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within a week of arrival.	We should adopt a single migration policy.
__label__noRel	In my point of view it will be essential to impose some compensatory levies on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage.	Europe should have stronger borders
__label__noRel	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__noRel	The right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good
__label__noRel	A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations, and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide.	We should end mass migration together.
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the security risks for asylum seekers are greatly reduced.	We should develop a strategy for the EU defense in relation to NATO
__label__noRel	To reduce poverty and inequalities, the EU should develop a legal framework guaranteeing minimum social standards, including decent living and working conditions as well as adequate social protection.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__noRel	Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration
__label__noRel	The organization of mass migration is a heinous crime. No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration.
__label__noRel	Europe’s sovereignty and credibility are at this price. The burden of European defense cannot rest on the back of a small number of countries and potential conflicts are increasing.	We should support Frontex.
__label__noRel	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.	We should preserve European culture
__label__noRel	Europe must lead the way when it comes to integrating people with Down syndrome	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed
__label__noRel	The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.	We should stop subsidizing mass livestock farms
__label__noRel	Frontex interfering with the national border guards doing their sacred duty to protect the border, and then sending anonymous reports to criticize these brave men and women is quite abhorrent.	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate
__label__noRel	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean sea is ended.	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	I think the problem in the EU is the incompetence to establish inventions in the market. There are lots of inventions that are made and funded by public EU research facilities brought into the market by small startups. In the end, they are picked like ripe fruits by the US or Chinese companies where the big money is made.	United in diversity should be a concept for reconciliation in the Western Balkans.
__label__noRel	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will only serve larger nations in the union and small member states would lose all their power and slowly turn into puppets of the larger nations instead of equal partners	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__noRel	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__noRel	We are Europeans; this is not racism but we don't support growth. If we accept many immigrants then we make a huge stop in the growth of the migrant countries, because I am 100% sure that they will never ever go back to their country.	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Across the EU, young people are continuing to face a number of significant challenges to enter and get a stable position in the labor market. They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are particularly affected. So we need a fairer migration policy but also consider migrant needs (and challenges) in other policy areas.	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU
__label__noRel	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts.	We should prohibit internal combustion engines
__label__noRel	The procedure of Family Reunification is already causing major problems in the USA.	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste
__label__noRel	If you want something like 'increasing the percentage of women in all sectors', you need to create more women or reduce the number of men. I will better not ask questions in this direction.	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants
__label__noRel	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	The current differing legal cultures of the Member States need to be developed into a common legal culture in Europe
__label__noRel	For sure you are technically or geographically correct, geographically Europe extends to the Ural mountains But in this forum, we initiate a common thinking on the future of Europe, which we associate with the EU. So please avoid any reference to arrogance and don't corrupt this respectful debate.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__noRel	Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes
__label__noRel	I am all for the creation of a European army, but for that, the question of the command of this army must also be resolved. And this is where the idea of a European Security Council is very interesting and deserves to be pushed.	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development
__label__noRel	Youth is a minority that will face the negative effects of climate change without being able to sufficiently participate in climate governance.	EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen”
__label__noRel	Sexual offences and other serious crimes giving rise to psychological trauma must be excluded from limitation periods, as it is often impossible for victims to remember, let alone report, within the limitation period.	Political institutions should make fundamental changes in the way they address climate change and environmental protection
__label__noRel	Ukraine is a part of Europe—geographically, diplomatically, and culturally. If Ukraine wants to join the EU, we should grant our brothers and sisters full membership in our Union.	We should make healthy food cheaper than unhealthy food
__label__noRel	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration.	There should be a common EU migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used in the aviation sector right now.

__label__noRel	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model.

There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	The integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about. Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development? They are as much Europeans as we are.	Europe must help Ukraine
__label__noRel	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research. This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic. These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.

__label__noRel	Illegal immigrants have to be returned to UN refugee camps.	We should invest in R&D
__label__noRel	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced. When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country.
__label__noRel	All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.

__label__noRel	In France, political repression fueled by rightwing ideology and ignorance led cities like Marseille to develop rampant crime that fed on the lucrative market of cannabis. Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing.	We should end animal abuse
__label__noRel	We should restrict delocalizing factories to third countries where environmental legislation is softer. We need unique legislation to avoid this.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society

__label__noRel	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix.

__label__noRel	A European army is not only needed to attack and defend but to give weight to European words.	We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports
__label__noRel	The pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant.

We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.
__label__noRel	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.

__label__noRel	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.	We should invest in integrated photovoltaic (e.g., over agriculturally used land)

__label__noRel	The language barrier and a weak influence on local thinking, allow local propaganda to pass on distorted and untrue information about what is happening in the EU to their citizens. Local governments have easy work to appropriate the positive things that the EU has achieved and, conversely, seduce its own failure on 'European bureaucracy'.	Political institutions should make fundamental changes in the way they address climate change and environmental protection
__label__noRel	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.	The EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states
__label__noRel	Sexual offences and other serious crimes giving rise to psychological trauma must be excluded from limitation periods, as it is often impossible for victims to remember, let alone report, within the limitation period.	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__noRel	We should encourage people to consider the question: 'Do you think it is morally right to torture, mutilate, and kill animals needlessly?'	We should fight racism in the EU
__label__noRel	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists

__label__noRel	Traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine is a safe and efficient way to improve well-being, and happiness and prevent illness. Also, an innumerable amount of people have got significant palliation or even total cure in cases, which the official health care system, unfortunately, couldn't help. This is clearly an area, where countries, civilizations, and schools of thought could learn a lot from each other.	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	Our Europe continent is in debt and doesn't have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to disregard our laws! We have enough poor people in Europe already and we need to take care of them!	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__noRel	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__noRel	The EU needs a humane, civilized, and legal way to manage migration, whether it is for economic reasons or to seek international protection.	We need integrated rail transport systems, agreements between various railway operators and a simple and accessible search engine
__label__noRel	The EU could play an important role in combatting misconceptions about immigration. Immigration needs to be controlled sensibly and immigrants should be taught European values and principles as well as the language of the host country.	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness
__label__noRel	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.	The EU should change its internal structure.

Germany should start paying reparations share for any damaged countries of Europe up to 100 years after its attack on international society
__label__noRel	We need to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in centers for repatriation.	We should label products with environmental impact and climate impacts in clear language

__label__noRel	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy
__label__noRel	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.	The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe
__label__noRel	Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language

__label__noRel	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__noRel	The idea of a circular economy could help us to tackle the problem of overconsumption and overproduction of waste.	We should make pushbacks legal
__label__noRel	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution. It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament.	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	I agree, no one should migrate to a country if they're going to commit a crime.	We need a Europe that respects life from conception is a humane Europe
__label__noRel	In my point of view it will be essential to impose some compensatory levies on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage.	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare for EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	To face future crises – from climate change over cancer to multi-resistant bacteria - we need a strong fundament of open research that will provide the solutions when needed.	The EU needs a European research center
__label__noRel	EU lacks a common language for its citizens, which would be easy to manage for all citizens and strengthen a sense of belonging, a common European identity while preserving their national identities.	We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians
__label__noRel	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__noRel	It is important to take into account all negative consequences in the balance sheet of companies so that everything that is taken/destroyed/polluted from nature is accounted for.	We should prohibit the sale of washing machines without suitable filters
__label__noRel	For a better migration policy, a European mission could be created to welcome migrants from the coasts of Libya and Tunisia. People welcomed in the centers in North Africa will be re-distributed to the countries of the Union. Are you insane?	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration

__label__noRel	If the EU intends to survive it has to integrate less. Go back to the EEC. Instead of building a static bloc, it should increase competitiveness.	We should create a European Wealth Fund
__label__noRel	It is necessary that member states better share the efforts of receiving asylum seekers upon arrival at EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to frontline countries.

We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society.
__label__noRel	Frontex interfering with the national border guards doing their sacred duty to protect the border, and then sending anonymous reports to criticize these brave men and women is quite abhorrent.	We need a better distribution of refugees
__label__noRel	Living in Europe is not a human right. Illegal migrants are willing to break a law and risk their lives (and the lives of their families), while unable to undergo the proper legal and established process and paperwork.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__noRel	Why have several EU passports when they actually represent one and the same thing?	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__noRel	Each migrant in the European Union must be given the possibility to integrate even if the refugee status is not clear. Integration programs could support this development in all cases.	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state
__label__noRel	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities
__label__noRel	Refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course. When it comes to crimes, people are simply no longer worthy of protection and cannot be expelled because their actions show us that they neither accept nor respect our rules.	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__noRel	This is a huge discrimination. Everyone should have the chance to develop to a personal level. Or should we all do an IQ-test to stay in our country? Because it could avoid dangerous things like rasicm.	Europe must help Ukraine
__label__noRel	This would address the current issues on habitats and species loss.	Frontex should regularly publish transparency reports
__label__noRel	Gas power plants produce CO2. Climate-damaging methane is released during extraction and transport, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste - a legacy for future generations - not to mention the current danger of release, e.g. through attacks, geological events, or operational accidents due to human or technical errors.	We need to develop a partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__noRel	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.	We should not subsidize large agricultural groups
__label__noRel	We need to strengthen citizens' trust in the European project! This requires more transparency and accountability, in particular when it comes to access to documents and democratic decision-making. The 'Better Regulation' approach of the Commission which focuses on cutting costs and burdens prioritizes business interests over general interests and should be abandoned. The European project needs to benefit the many and not the few!	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products

__label__noRel	The future is 'work mobility'; thus we need to simplify taxation, enhance remote working opportunities, and enable inter-country recruitment for companies.	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__noRel	There are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy
__label__noRel	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.	The EU should strengthen development cooperation.
__label__noRel	This idea is what we have been doing for the last 30 years. It did not produce sufficient results to justify continuing on this path. It is just saying, that problem will solve itself. This proposition is harmful and does not stand on any data that could justify it.	The European Union, as a Union of values, should limit its support to countries that do not want to adhere to European values and violate the rights of their citizens
__label__noRel	The European Commission’sportrays migration as an opportunity only, a Fatality that cannot be stopped, and the only solution against aging.	We do not need any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	We must move towards full co-decision power for the European Parliament and the abolition of unanimity for climate, energy, social affairs, and taxation policies.	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	The EU is not responsible for the entire World.	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
__label__noRel	A European Wealth Fund should be created to serve as the nexus for strategic investments in European and international economic activity aligning with European fundamental rights, norms, and values and the global green and digital transition.	The EU needs a single market for news
__label__noRel	Cheap and accessible train travel brings everyone closer together regardless of borders	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.
__label__noRel	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.	We should protect very large natural areas
__label__noRel	everyone should have a right to own cryptocurrency.	The EU should join NATO
__label__noRel	Direct democracy is too open to manipulation by populists and malefactors via social media. A transparent representative democracy with a solid lid on lobbyism is to be preferred.	We should make pushbacks legal
__label__noRel	People from several countries are asking for asylum in Europe in hope of better life conditions. Those people aren’t guilty for being born in those countries and EU should support everyone.	We should improve and modernize our energy infrastructure
__label__noRel	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.	There should be a common EU migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy is not green because of radioactive waste.	The EU needs a single market for news
__label__noRel	In the UK since 2015, there were over 80 PV-related fires, at least 1/4 of which were actually solar panels catching fire, releasing toxic smoke, and contaminating the ground with cadmium.	We should ban wild animals in circuses
__label__noRel	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.
__label__noRel	It would be a better idea to abolish the European Parliament. It has become an ideological Kabuki Theatre. The Commission should be entirely under the control of the sovereign member states, of course, who remain the masters of the treaties.	The EU should extend the model of Pooling & Sharing European military resources beyond air transport.
__label__noRel	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__noRel	No more immigration from non-European or non-first world countries.	The EU leadership must enter into strong agreements with the countries where immigrants come from, in order to retain them in their countries
__label__noRel	In Conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we are making business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '	We should invest in R&D
__label__noRel	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__noRel	Many people, even in the richest European countries, work hard, work overtime or have several jobs & cannot sustain themselves. That's humiliating, time-consuming alien to physical & mental health, and poisoning society.	There should be a better post-Brexit European Alliance
__label__noRel	We need to realize the truth of what's out there. Truthful and open research without bias or stigmas.	We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports
__label__noRel	I find the current actions of China to be incompatible with the ideology that the EU was formed and still has to this day, we can not have a relaxed attitude towards a country that sees all the world as competitors and enemies.	Voting for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory
__label__noRel	Quotas are always disgusting examples of oppression and evil. I don't want anything of that, I want freedom and free choice.	We should adopt a single migration policy.
__label__noRel	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__noRel	The technology-enabled economy of abundance without human exploitation you can endorse it. We should not hamper automation, instead, we should rethink morals about work. Let the robots do all the bad jobs and let human beings be free to pursue a creative and meaningful life	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.
__label__noRel	The EU should treat economic migrants with more vigilance. They cannot be the solution to the aging European population. We need more focus on border control to curb illegal migration.	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration.
__label__noRel	Eventually, the best solution would be a world wide agreement (as within OECD and like minded) such as the global minimum tax rate.	We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses
__label__noRel	Making compost out of organic waste and distribute it to gardeners and farmers will help to create value and a better environment.	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.
__label__noRel	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	We should ban wild animals in circuses
__label__noRel	Public services of good quality and universal access are key to ensuring fairer, more inclusive, and equal societies. They have a clear redistributive effect and help steer development in a more sustainable direction. The Covid-19 crisis if anything helped to prove the crucial role that the public sector and public services play and must continue playing!	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
__label__noRel	In fact, political NGOs advocating for any cause whatsoever should be banned from schools and kindergartens.	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__noRel	Not only for committing, but also planning. Especially if an immigrant gets caught planning a terrorist act, he/she must be removed from EU permanently.	We should create a common constitution
__label__noRel	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.	We need a better EU migration policy
__label__noRel	If the EU intends to survive it has to integrate less. Go back to the EEC. Instead of building a static bloc, it should increase competitiveness.	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency
__label__noRel	We should restrict delocalizing factories to third countries where environmental legislation is softer. We need unique legislation to avoid this.	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people
__label__noRel	We must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.	The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	We cannot afford a lost generation, so we need to invest in quality jobs and young people for our future!	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
__label__noRel	Illegal immigrants have to be returned to UN refugee camps.	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries
__label__noRel	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.	We should put a higher tax or a toll on imported meat from abroad.
__label__noRel	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop immigration.	Toilet paper should be made of recycled paper only
__label__noRel	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	We should improve migration policies
__label__noRel	Europe should choose a common language. This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language.	Europe should establish a common Army across Europe
__label__noRel	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate. The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country. There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes. Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society.
__label__noRel	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	All refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left.	We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East
__label__noRel	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us.	The EU should enforce minority protection
__label__noRel	Pushbacks may not be a nice way of operating. However, Brussels is causing problems by telling the whole World that everyone (7 billion people) has the right to apply for asylum in the EU. It would be much better by refusing admission to anyone appearing at the border without papers. The experience is that over 80% of the immigrants are not refugees in danger.	We should prohibit internal combustion engines
__label__noRel	The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
__label__noRel	The EU leadership fails to carry out its fundamental duties: guard its border and protect its own people. Even 30 years after Schengen was introduced.	Permanent non-EU nationals who are living in the European Union should have more rights.
__label__noRel	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced. When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
__label__noRel	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.	The EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation
__label__noRel	In a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.	We should remove illegal immigrants.
__label__noRel	Capitalism and the free market indeed created western wealth. However, the interesting question then is: who benefited from this wealth? Without some sort of regulation and control from the State, companies will continue what they do best, increase profit without any concern for environmental and social matters.	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__noRel	What will the Europeans think if the candidates are always, for each election, either French, German, or maybe Spanish, and neither coming from small countries?	There should be a federal Constitution for a European Federation
__label__noRel	Nonsense. Mass migration is a crime against humanity. Endorse this idea: No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration
__label__noRel	This single migration policy should include that: Brussels (EU) handles the paperwork and logistics. Including, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem

__label__noRel	It is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens

Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities.

This way, we can establish a single common market.	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency

In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix.

__label__noRel	It's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).

__label__noRel	This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.

Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.	There should be a small council of people from all over the world, and identify the problems of every country and solve them.

Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start. If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially.

__label__noRel	Exported trash is burning for months suffocating local people and wildlife.	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.
__label__noRel	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness
__label__noRel	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people.	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__noRel	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.	The EU should enforce minority protection
__label__noRel	The number of video surveillance and control and intervention rights for public authorities is steadily increasing (at least according to my subjective feeling).

__label__noRel	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.	Doctors should be paid based on how many people they successfully treated
__label__noRel	The European flag should be systematically displayed, in addition to the national flag, on any facade of an embassy or consulate of a European country.

This approach could accompany the construction of common structures and policies in the field of foreign affairs.	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare for EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	We pay taxes and we have the right to see where our money goes. It’s very easy to implement through an online platform same as digital banking, but for the state. This will stamp out corruption and thereby free up a huge amount of money that we can spend on the needs of the population.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__noRel	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__noRel	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values.

We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__noRel	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists
__label__noRel	To have a chance that one candidate (with a good chance to win) comes from your own country, I think people from little countries can wait 40 years.

__label__noRel	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU. Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose.

__label__noRel	EU leaders continue their naive policy of hosting millions of migrants from Muslim countries without taking into consideration the inability to integrate into society even after many generations, and the fact that the Muslim diaspora is controlled by their countries of origin, the most flagrant example is the interference of Turkey and its dictator Erdogan in the German elections calling the Turkish diaspora to boycott this election since none of the candidates please him.	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__noRel	If you want something like 'increasing the percentage of women in all sectors', you need to create more women or reduce the number of men. I will better not ask questions in this direction.	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe
__label__noRel	The EU is not responsible for the entire World.	We should stop making one-cent coins

__label__noRel	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop the conflict.	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__noRel	The European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides. And as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are doing constantly dividing work between member states. As all successes start in your head, perhaps some attention should be allocated to the media. The EU has a clear chance to become one of the major poles of this multipolar world order.	Wind and solar energy resources are a commodity, provided by big companies.
__label__noRel	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.	The Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept.

What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights	We should preserve bees and polling insects
__label__noRel	The migrants that are already (legally) here should be taught western values so they and their families can integrate/assimilate, as the age-old saying goes 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'.

__label__noRel	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. NGOs organize, finance, and promote migration to get advantages.	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy
__label__noRel	The European Parliament is in dire need of reform. It has become a circus, where the MEPs engage in wild ideological posturing without substance. The EP's function is to address the pressing needs of EU citizens, but it hasn't done that for ages. One possible solution could be to replace it with a legislative body that is made up of delegates from member state parliaments.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe

__label__noRel	Nations that have adopted living wages for full-time jobs have highly profited from that step. It's been an economic booster because if people who earn & possess little can afford what they need, they will buy. So they increase demand. Demand increases supply. More supply means more jobs, more suppliers, lower costs, etc.	The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, but unfortunately it's framed as a British/brexit issue. However, the wider concept of a common EU visa / migration system is a compelling one. Harmonising the system to a common visa regime offers many advantages.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society.
__label__noRel	The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter. The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality.	We should implement minimum EU social standards
__label__noRel	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	We should invest in R&D
__label__noRel	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.	We should limit the number of plastic types used for packaging
__label__noRel	Mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__noRel	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__noRel	I think increasing taxes on tobacco could do a similar thing. But then we would also have to increase the contributions to health insurance for people who overeat sugar, use sunbeds, etc., to be fair.	Toilet paper should be made of recycled paper only
__label__noRel	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener. In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.

__label__noRel	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime!	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__noRel	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.	We should prohibit internal combustion engines
__label__noRel	Pushbacks may not be a nice way of operating. However, Brussels is causing problems by telling the whole World that everyone (7 billion people) has the right to apply for asylum in the EU. It would be much better by refusing admission to anyone appearing at the border without papers. The experience is that over 80% of the immigrants are not refugees in danger.	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__noRel	It will take years before the local farmers will be able to give well paid jobs to the local workers. In the meantime you'll have a famine and a genocide.

They need urgent help!	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality
__label__noRel	A direct election of a European president is a travesty of democracy. It would be only a mediatic competition among 'plastic' leaders.

__label__noRel	If you want to do it for nuclear power, then it would be better to do it for every single kind of energy production methods. It’s also important then to include the complete cycle of all the energies, the human cost, the extraction of primary resources, in the case of renewable energy, take into account the necessary energy storage, and so on and so forth.

More concrete and fairer European policy on economic migration, to establish legal channels for entry and to foster an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as a key tool to address the social impact of migration flows.	The EU should be involved in the creation of a media-funding framework
__label__noRel	The migration pressure from Africa towards Europe results from a significant difference in perceived quality of life. It is in the interest of the EU and its member states to reduce that difference by working with the AU to level up and develop African nations.	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__noRel	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions.

__label__noRel	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. They are internationally recognized & very precise. As far as I know, all or most countries have agreed on these goals. The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details.	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.' The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__noRel	European institutions should take factual studies of the relative harm of different drugs into account.

__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate.

Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond
__label__noRel	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans

__label__noRel	For more than 50 years immigration has been going on uncontrolled and unchecked. No changes need to be made before we have an agreement that people ignoring our immigration laws should be detained in repatriation facilities with no chance of re-entering the EU. Once we agree on that we can start talking about funds and resources for those who do deserve help.	We should improve and modernize our energy infrastructure
__label__noRel	Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).	We should make healthy food cheaper than unhealthy food
__label__noRel	Without change, the EU will be following the route of the USSR and other communist countries, who after 70 years of trying to build a social paradise ended in poverty and suppression.	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.

__label__noRel	The integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about. Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development? They are as much Europeans as we are.	We should increase the legal warranty from 2 years to 5 years on all products in Europe

__label__noRel	The World, in particular Africa and the Middle East, is experiencing a huge population explosion. They seem not to be able to cope with it as China did. Who is going to take all these millions of refugees which result from it? Also, consider that the integration of one non-western immigrant costs 167.000 euros. If the EU intends to survive it has to stop more or less all migration.	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.

EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen”
__label__noRel	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.	We should limit population growth in overcrowded regions
__label__noRel	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__noRel	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__noRel	I think it is extremely important to upgrade our relations with the former Eastern European countries and in that way move us in the right direction. It is now they need us the most. The area around the Black Sea has enormous potential. They have a growth zone that moves from western Europe to the east and at the same time a growth zone that moves from south China to the north.	The EU should reduce its influence on its member states.
__label__noRel	Compared to most anglophone countries, Europe has been quite timid in attracting talent across the globe. Too few people know of and make use of the EU Blue Card. The EU is a destination of choice for migration and refugees from developing and some neighboring countries.	Imprisonment of foreign criminals should be carried out in their country
__label__noRel	The problem of youth employment has been there for a long time but was underlined again during the pandemic. Many young people are forced to move to a different country in order to find work.	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
__label__noRel	This would help to plan the most efficient and economical itinerary	The European Union shall guarantee its territorial integrity against threats from Russia and shall seek to eliminate the influence of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe.
__label__noRel	The proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__noRel	IQ tests do not prevent ill-intentioned people from entering our borders. Canada aims to receive 400,000 people each year, and how intelligent or skilled they are does not matter. People working in the agricultural fields are being naturalized, relatives are being naturalized.	We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering
__label__noRel	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.	We need Integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	Subsidies for meat production and fishery not only have a negative impact on our environment - but they also destroy the economy in poorer countries in Africa! We really should find a way to stop these and get out of this vicious circle!	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration.

This must stop before we consume an apple's worth of plastics every week.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__noRel	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa. Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans.	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare
__label__noRel	Absolutely unacceptable because it would lead to the politicization of the justice system.	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality
__label__noRel	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities
__label__noRel	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	European citizens want quality of life and are not interested in world supremacy
__label__noRel	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.

They stick to themselves and become a new tribe that tries to change their host country.'	EU institutions should prioritize the struggle against all forms of racism, also anti-Muslim bigotry, and antisemitism
__label__noRel	At this stage it is not worth investing money in current nuclear technology, what we should be doing is investing more in research into nuclear fusion energy, which is really the clean and safe energy we need and which we are getting closer and closer to achieving, in order to have those artificial suns working as soon as possible.	The EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states

__label__noRel	I don't really agree with that. Europe is not China and is not the USA. We don't need a strong army because Europeans don't plan to make war, our strength is to find common ground and bring peace to the world with diplomacy and intelligence.	The 19 June plenary meeting of the European Conference should mark a first step in the direction of a stronger and more united EU in the world
__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece.	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__noRel	To build a common European understanding and to create a European identity, we need our own common language.	We should reduce animal farming.
__label__noRel	The Covid-19 pandemic showed us that the European Union is not able to come up with technological innovations that could strengthen our economic position.	We should criminalize the export of waste
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy is undoubtedly the best form of electricity production, massive and controllable, with no CO2/GHG emissions.	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__noRel	A fair, sustainable, and open Europe benefits everyone. Our common future demands actions to put human rights, solidarity, and social justice on top of the agenda.	We should fight racism in the EU
__label__noRel	The individual member states are too weak to cope with the major challenges of our time.	We should change corporate accounting rules to include climate change and biodiversity loss
__label__noRel	As the sustainability goals of the UN contain working conditions, human rights, environmental & climate issues together with questions of governance, they are ideal to incentivize sustainability in all sectors and fend off unsustainable practices and competition.	Solar and wind energies have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	We already have successful programs for students from refugee camps. Enhance that.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands.
__label__noRel	This will create conditions for the development and education of a Human with a capital “H”, cultivating moral values in each person and society. We should prohibit propaganda of violence, condemnation, and denunciation of any form of division, aggression, and anti-humane manifestations	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__noRel	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU	We should restrict immigration.
__label__noRel	People's feelings arent all that important. If you have had enough of the Internet, you can always find yourself a hobby.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	I wholeheartedly agree. Securing our neighbors and allies has to be a priority. The only thing that causes me some dismay is Turkey being a part of NATO. It was a good idea in 1951 but clearly, Turkey must be out off the map now.	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters
__label__noRel	Instead we need to change our behavior, reduce our consumerism and decrease our overall resource use per person.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__noRel	Yes, though some countries have other problems right now. Give member states the possibility to choose: more refugees & more money & support or less refugees & less money & support. Very simple.	We need a better migration policy.
__label__noRel	Esperanto should be promoted as an international lingua franca. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of cross-cultural communication, allowing high degrees of inclusion.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__noRel	The EU should be able to contribute to a relaunch of global multilateralism, through a profound reform based on democracy and peace, solidarity, and respect for human, social, and environmental rights.	Doctors should be paid based on how many people they successfully treated
__label__noRel	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	We should abolish the European Council
__label__noRel	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. They are internationally recognized & very precise. As far as I know, all or most countries have agreed on these goals. The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__noRel	Members should adopt measures to end unpaid Internships causes they are a form of exploitation of young people.	The EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation
__label__noRel	The nations of Europe are the most responsible for the state of the global climate and we need to take the responsibility.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
__label__noRel	Instead we need to reduce inequality in between countries and distribute wealth more evenly around the world.	We should protect the European border
__label__noRel	Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this.	We need a plan for receiving asylum/migrants.
__label__noRel	Too many times so-called leaders around the world like Trump and Boris Johnson have made a mockery of Europe and Europeans with zero response from EU leaders. These things affect people's pride and give out a sense of weakness.	The Commission should remove any mention of gender and other ideology from its research funds and calls.
__label__noRel	Sounds a little xenophobic. There is no concept of indigenous or aborigenous population in Europe, the only criteria is citizenship.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__noRel	If we do have an EU citizenship we will have an EU country and EU already proved to be no good dealing with problems and is extremely undemocratic and not listening to the people.	We need a plan for receiving asylum/migrants.
__label__noRel	Fear of the unknown is normal behavior. It has saved our race since ages starting when mankind was a simple monkey among others.	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
__label__noRel	It would render the meetings useless since they would only be able to express official statements and instead negotiate new ideas without pressure.	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare
__label__noRel	Nothing illustrates to me more the fall of European ethics than pro-abortion arguments. Nobody can dispute that a baby in the womb is alive and human, and yet people call their killing a 'human right'. How could we fall so low?	We do not want illegal migration.
__label__noRel	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	We should support Frontex.
__label__noRel	If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia. In order to support them we need a European army and a common foreign policy.	We should invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration.	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state

The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__noRel	The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 Frenchman would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own above people whose countries the Americans have bombed to shreds.	The European Union should visible on the facades of the embassies and consulates of European countries.
__label__noRel	It's high time that all broadcasting stations in the EU stimulate their journalists to cover European news as well.	We should preserve bees and polling insects
__label__noRel	This will reduce pollution and make people have better health, while at the same time reducing the impact on their budget and on the environment. What are we waiting for?	We need an integrated migration and border policy.
__label__noRel	Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__noRel	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU
__label__noRel	Do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately. The EU does not have an actual army - not because of bureaucrats but because our member states think they are better alone than united.	There should be 6 concrete proposals for migrants on the Balkan route.
__label__noRel	Without bees, which are dying en masse, Europe’s existence is impossible. The problem is complex and it is about the influence of poisonous pesticides and other agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as the influence of GSM technologies, which lead to overheating of the bee’s body, which falls under the negative impact of microwaves. Therefore, Europe must create a series of policies to help bees survive in the name of the surplus of European nations.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__noRel	It's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__noRel	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger.	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country.
__label__noRel	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.	We should stop making one-cent coins
__label__noRel	If we want to uphold to our standards and what the EU represents, we shall help those immigrants and give them the tools to help us make our homes better and multicultural so when the chance is presented they can then have a way to help their countries. Simply blocking them out of our region and neglecting them won't solve anything. We will only make unnecessary enemies.	We should not produce unnecessary garbage
__label__noRel	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need.
__label__noRel	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments.	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes
__label__noRel	I think forcing people to eat a limited amount of meat is totally the wrong way because of the following reasons: 1. It would cause so much more bureaucracy 2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat? 3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.	We should improve migration policies
__label__noRel	Esperanto is a common language of citizens from all countries of the EU. Esperanto encounters bring them together for contact and understanding. The authorities of the European Union are called upon to support this direct communication of the citizens. It is our free choice in which language we want to talk to each other - please recognize and promote it!	The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees
__label__noRel	This way all EU countries have access to a single database which will reduce paperwork and registration and provide immediate and informed service without the risk of complications, especially in regard to medical history.	We should limit the number of plastic types used for packaging
__label__noRel	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.	We should protect the European border.
__label__noRel	Migrants sell drugs.	The EU should ensure a free, independent, and functioning judiciary in its Member States
__label__noRel	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy
__label__noRel	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.	There should be a better post-Brexit European Alliance
__label__noRel	In addition to production and shipping, the score should also reflect the impact of the product's disposal. For example if the product requires to apply many different (toxic) chemicals for recycling, this should result in a worse score.	We should abolish Chatcontrol
__label__noRel	I think the EU should subsidies troubled cash-strapped cities to reduce ticket prices or completely remove any charges so that people are vivisected to hop on the bus rather than in the car. As I student, I would have been in the city center a lot more and spent money around the shops if I could afford the bus fair in the first place.	The EU should have common taxation and social policy
__label__noRel	Please consider this: right now in Africa several million people are half starved, and eat a meal a day at best. They live thanks to cheap agricultural products coming from Europe, because local stuff is too expensive for them.	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__noRel	The shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens. And it is not in line with the fundamental rights the EU is supposed to put into practice.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__noRel	People's feelings arent all that important. If you have had enough of the Internet, you can always find yourself a hobby.	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection
__label__noRel	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.	We should increase the salaries of artisans
__label__noRel	We all want to see transparent, democratic, and value-based policy-making. The right to good administration is embedded in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and should guide the EU's actions.	We should label products with environmental impact and climate impacts in clear language
__label__noRel	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__noRel	We are increasingly witnessing malicious journalism, corrupted by feelings and disinformation. The purpose of the press services must, as soon as possible, be to bring the news back to the public in the most detailed and detailed manner possible, without inciting malicious and incorrect drawing of attention.

There should be better EU relations with Russia
__label__noRel	I understand your point and its importance, but as long as I have fangs in my mouth I will want to eat meat (like most people). You'd be better off suggesting more research into food printers.	We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions
__label__noRel	In Conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we are making business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, in our society, a healthy person is not profitable. Pharma is a big business, doctors are being paid for prescribing drugs. Modern healthcare should be preventive. Doctors should be encouraged and paid for curing people and keeping them healthy. Good quality healthcare should be accessible in every part of the world and should be free as there is nothing more important than human life.	The EU should join NATO
__label__noRel	Chatcontrol harms minors as well — it shifts attention to risks online, but abuses occur mainly offline: in families living in poverty and degradation; in the structures that should help them; in EU-funded refugee camps, or in countries with which we have diplomatic relations.	We should increase the legal warranty from 2 years to 5 years on all products in Europe
__label__noRel	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.	We should decriminalize drug use
__label__noRel	It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.	We should end mass migration together.
__label__noRel	We can only employ people in understaffed job fields.	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants
__label__noRel	Glass is one of the biggest causes of human death for birds.	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.
__label__noRel	It's by no means irrelevant what kind of cars people use; 25% renewable + 25% nuclear + 50% combustible is better than 100% combustible gasoline.	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	The family is people's foundation and it rests on it all their lives and work, and this needs to be valued.	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__noRel	Makes sense to me, its easy to learn and doesn't come with any nationalist baggage.	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
__label__noRel	Nations that have adopted living wages for full-time jobs have highly profited from that step. It's been an economic booster because if people who earn & possess little can afford what they need, they will buy. So they increase demand. Demand increases supply. More supply means more jobs, more suppliers, lower costs, etc.	EU countries should slightly reduce health insurance contributions for all citizens who do not use tobacco products
__label__noRel	The British people voted for Brexit, so now naturally they have to live with their choice. It turns out you can't actually have your cake and eat it too.	There should be a new EU foreign policy.
__label__noRel	The EU should treat economic migrants with more vigilance. They cannot be the solution to the aging European population. We need more focus on border control to curb illegal migration.	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism.
__label__noRel	Europeans should retain control of our homeland, just as everyone else should theirs.	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country.
__label__noRel	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.	We need a stand-alone European army.
__label__noRel	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__noRel	There is a lack of security and defense policy that can realistically be achieved by strengthening the Euro body as the 28th European army.	We should stop hosting migrants from Muslim countries
__label__noRel	The demographic problems for the EU, which are real, must be solved by encouraging child-bearing and a generous family policy, not through migration. We must celebrate motherhood and Moms. We must realize that raising a child involves serious costs in today's Europe.	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.
__label__noRel	Additionally when fear is reinforced by facts like increased violence in every country with a high number of immigrants, and rapes of women it is not a problem of 'perception' but a simple reality.	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing
__label__noRel	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__noRel	Not taking climate impact and biodiversity loss into account makes it difficult for businesses to move towards a more virtuous system.	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism
__label__noRel	Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Regressive outdated ideologies and values should have no place in Europe.	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	For more than 50 years immigration has been going on uncontrolled and unchecked. No changes need to be made before we have an agreement that people ignoring our immigration laws should be detained in repatriation facilities with no chance of re-entering the EU. Once we agree on that we can start talking about funds and resources for those who do deserve help.	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them. We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform
__label__noRel	Such a hub could also have a bridging role between local necessities and opportunities at the EU level, such as project funding.	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__noRel	Sustainable development and climate change mitigation in EU Trade deals should be examples of best practices of EU policy.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries
__label__noRel	More illegal and legal migration will lead to more unemployment, lower wages, more insecurity, and less sustainable social systems.	We need to invest in nuclear energy
__label__noRel	How would the candidates be selected? One per country? That just makes it a tight race between the two countries with the largest population (assuming one vote per person). Why would e.g. a Greek person vote for a Swedish candidate? How would even a Swedish candidate campaign in such a way as to appeal to Greek voters?	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable
__label__noRel	Without increased financing of research, we will lack a firm evidence base.	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness
__label__noRel	The incentive to provide free public transport in European cities in the future would make it easier for people, especially in the cities, to accept and appreciate that there will be fewer and fewer cars.

I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.

We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy
__label__noRel	There is a need for a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not moved an inch since 2019. There have been attempts of making progress in adopting a common European asylum system and forming an EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while also stressing its aim to closely monitor migration routes and maintain situational awareness. This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.

We should be aware of migration due to climate change
__label__noRel	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!	The EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey.
__label__noRel	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.	We need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy.

__label__noRel	Mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.	The EU should promote organizations that teach the national language via Esperanto
__label__noRel	Just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?	We should invest in integrated photovoltaic (e.g., over agriculturally used land)

__label__noRel	Europe has more than enough ideological disputes within its own borders. We must settle those first - by falling back on a previous, more classical liberal position that was uncontroversial for most of our citizens.

__label__noRel	The right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate
__label__noRel	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals.

__label__noRel	Subsidizing big agricultural companies is not the problem here, it's the criteria by which the subsidies are distributed.	We need a stand-alone European army.
__label__noRel	The EU needs to focus on simplifying and standardizing European processes and procedures associated with public management and creating efficient and effective anti-corruption mechanisms. This will reduce the financial resources to be made available to the most relevant areas of intervention at the EU, country, and regional Levels.	We should preserve European culture
__label__noRel	A common train network would be a strong alternative to air- and even the car-travel if it is done properly with the right services and prices.

The land exists independently of the land owner.	The EU should establish a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
__label__noRel	It is absolutely ridiculous to be spending money on these climate disastrous practices. The EU is nowhere close to keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement and is still funding unsustainable practices left and right.	We should support short-distance economies
__label__noRel	Nuclear power takes little space, and unlike wind and solar works 24/7 and 7 years to build on average.	The EU should reduce its influence on its member states.
__label__noRel	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	The EU should be involved in the creation of a media-funding framework
__label__noRel	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced

__label__noRel	To prevent precarious conditions, we must put in place quality standards, they must be binding for all jobs created under EU and National recovery plans. Better monitoring and trade union involvement are needed to assess and report youth unemployment and NEET rates. At the moment these numbers hide forced mobility, involuntary part-time employment, and work in a grey and informal economy. Urgent measures are needed to fight youth unemployment and precarious working conditions in sectors where young people are overrepresented (tourism; gig economy...).	We should abolish the European Council
__label__noRel	Economic interests should never be at the expense of social and environmental policy. It is of utmost importance that the protection of workers’ rights and the rules we agreed upon with the Paris Agreement on climate change are at the heart of trade and investment policy. As the EU belongs to the global market, we must guarantee decent jobs that are sustainable, as well as collective, independent representation of workers in trade unions.	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__noRel	For Europe to act outwardly as a unit, we must first look inward. At the psychological level, how can we create a European home market? What does it take, for example, for a resident of Spain to think of Czech printers as a local product? Will it be possible to reach an agreement on Europe's historical events and interpret them to everyone's satisfaction? This process will take some time.	Coronavirus protection should be advertised on TV and social media
__label__noRel	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing
__label__noRel	The EU should attract the world's most talented and most entrepreneurial. There was an attempt to reform the blue card directive by the Junker commission in order to create a new streamlined EU-wide visa category, similar to the short-lived Schengen visa. The holder of the new blue-card-like visa would have the entire EU labor market at their disposal.	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms
__label__noRel	Pooling & Sharing integrates military capabilities at the European level and creates a European culture in the military sector.	There should be an enlargement of the European Union.
__label__noRel	The EU should do it in an impartial manner and act against all countries regardless of political ideology. The EU should stand out to help all minorities and not just the politically advantageous ones. The oppression of Catalonians and Hungarian minorities outside its border is a constant problem since WW2 and it is completely ignored. If the EU wants to convince the masses, then it can't just cherrypick issues.	We do not want illegal migration.
__label__noRel	The family is people's foundation and it rests on it all their lives and work, and this needs to be valued.	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately

__label__noRel	People's feelings arent all that important. If you have had enough of the Internet, you can always find yourself a hobby.	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration.
__label__noRel	There's nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and putting your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as self-evident. We need to negotiate Remigration deals with the 3rd countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push back any migrants coming to our borders.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__noRel	I agree. Young people should have a voice in policymaking. Regulation needs to reduce forms of precarious work. It is time to expand collective bargaining coverage to all forms of work. It is essential to introduce a right to decent housing and policies capping rents and limiting property market speculation. we urgently need investment to achieve this. Youth is the future, we have to take care of it.	We should have legal migration channels.
__label__noRel	Hungary’s and Poland’s governments have ruthlessly corrupted their judgments to get a free card on abstract EU funds. Enough! If even Romania can be carried out to join the enhanced cooperation, those last two must be forced.	Gas and nuclear power should be supported with money from European countries
__label__noRel	Gas power plants produce CO2. Climate-damaging methane is released during extraction and transport, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste - a legacy for future generations - not to mention the current danger of release, e.g. through attacks, geological events, or operational accidents due to human or technical errors.	The EU should be involved in the creation of a media-funding framework

__label__noRel	It is absolutely necessary that we have a system of accountability, both for member states and other countries. Human rights and liberties always come first!	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__noRel	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.	Esperanto should be the common language for the European Union.
__label__noRel	It would be easier if the EU joined NATO. The internal rivalry between the single EU states would stop. Also, the issue of a legitimate European army would be solved. However, I am not sure how this would work out in legal terms. Federations have already joined NATO, rather than individual states, but what would be the status of the EU?	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__noRel	A psychological examination should be part of child screening, together with counseling to parents (e.g. dealing with children’s own concerns and fears, or increasing self-confidence among children and parents). It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognize them in the home and learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health.	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government.
__label__noRel	The shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens. And it is not in line with the fundamental rights the EU is supposed to put into practice.	We should implement minimum EU social standards
__label__noRel	Education is key. School curricula could help have more responsible consumption.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.

Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.	We should decriminalize drug use

__label__noRel	The idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy.

__label__noRel	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this.	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__noRel	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.

Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities. Ableism keeps getting perpetuated in the EU and it needs to stop. We want more representation! We want people with Down Syndrome to be fully included in the European Union institutions!

__label__noRel	A common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data.

__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry.

Voting for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory
__label__noRel	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa. Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from

__label__noRel	The only meaningful immigration is when there is a member country with a specific vacancy. That member will also be responsible for the integration (at a cost of Euro 167,000).

Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.	Gas and nuclear power should be supported with money from European countries
__label__noRel	allow it to be handed out to charities for consumption by those in need.	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste
__label__noRel	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration.	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector
__label__noRel	t is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU
__label__noRel	We need to ensure fair redistribution of refugees across Europe and ensure better integration of refugees and applicants for international protection into the workplace. More concrete and fairer European policy on economic migration, to establish legal channels for entry and to foster an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as a key tool to address the social impact of migration flows.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	The technology-enabled economy of abundance without human exploitation you can endorse it. We should not hamper automation, instead, we should rethink morals about work. Let the robots do all the bad jobs and let human beings be free to pursue a creative and meaningful life	We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.
__label__noRel	It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.
__label__noRel	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__noRel	At this stage it is not worth investing money in current nuclear technology, what we should be doing is investing more in research into nuclear fusion energy, which is really the clean and safe energy we need and which we are getting closer and closer to achieving, in order to have those artificial suns working as soon as possible.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__noRel	It is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.	We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions
__label__noRel	The EU leadership fails to carry out its fundamental duties: guard its border and protect its own people. Even 30 years after Schengen was introduced.	We should prohibit internal combustion engines
__label__noRel	I am not prepared to continue to restrict my freedom on a permanent basis due to the actions of a minority of offenders, as a citizen who is not a victim. The policy has to find a better balance here.	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__noRel	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__noRel	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.).	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain
__label__noRel	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness
__label__noRel	Integration and immigration in a host country require a lot of effort	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection
__label__noRel	The proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste
__label__noRel	Illegal immigrants have to be returned to UN refugee camps.	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax
__label__noRel	Illegal immigrants have to be returned to UN refugee camps.	We should create an EU protocol for UAP reports of personnel employed by airlines and personnel of all armed forces for all member states
__label__noRel	Just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__noRel	The only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans. This must change.	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	I agree. Stable, quality jobs and adequate social protection for everyone are necessary. Trade unions have many proposals to achieve more equal and inclusive labor markets. This goes hand in hand with policies to promote more equal, sustainable, and inclusive societies.	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	The idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy.	The EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey.
__label__noRel	Giving small countries 'veto rights' is a recipe for disaster that will keep the European Union separated and weak instead of united and reliable in policy making.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__noRel	The EU deciding who is a journalist amounts to the EU deciding what is true.	We need a revision of the current asylum policy in the European Union.
__label__noRel	There is scientific consensus on the fact that fish have the ability to feel pain and emotions such as fear.	We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology
__label__noRel	We have a deficit in democracy in the EU because of the lack of coverage of European affairs in our media. It's also the reason why people don't know much about the EU and don't understand how it benefits us all.	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__noRel	In circuses, wild animals in circuses are destined to a life of physical abuse and mental torture.	The EU needs human security approach to ensure peace.
__label__noRel	No, Europe is not a colony. Immigration has been devastating. Public EU officials who support immigration should be named and the European people must be given a democratic opportunity to remove them from positions of power and influence.	We should end mass migration together.
__label__noRel	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East.
__label__noRel	In other words, EU (taxpayer)-sponsored propaganda.	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	Protecting the EU's external borders and guaranteeing that no one can enter the Schengen free movement zone who does not have the right to do so is a primary condition for security in Budapest, Berlin, Lyon, or anywhere in Europe.	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__noRel	If we tried to fix the issue by controlling the population, countries like Denmark would need to reduce their population to 1/5 of the current number, to reach sustainable resource use.	We need a Europe that respects life from conception is a humane Europe
__label__noRel	Legal traditions are different for a reason. They are the result of centuries of organic legal evolution. They cannot be overwritten with a stroke of a pen.	The Commission should remove any mention of gender and other ideology from its research funds and calls.
__label__noRel	The migration pressure from Africa towards Europe results from a significant difference in perceived quality of life. It is in the interest of the EU and its member states to reduce that difference by working with the AU to level up and develop African nations.	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources
__label__noRel	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common.

There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism.
__label__noRel	Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.	There should be no illegal migration
__label__noRel	Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the greatest existential threat to the EU. Even more so than the CO2 threat.	There should be a small council of people from all over the world, and identify the problems of every country and solve them.
__label__noRel	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__noRel	The idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy.	We should preserve bees and polling insects
__label__noRel	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__noRel	Instead we need to change our behavior, reduce our consumerism and decrease our overall resource use per person.	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees
__label__noRel	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop the conflict.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__noRel	Turkey is encroaching on EU territory, Russia is sending its army to the Ukrainian border, and what can we do? Nothing, because nobody is taking us seriously. Our threats are empty and get ignored, and our diplomacy is weak. It's time for the EU to be recognized as a strong force that can and will protect its people and its interests.	There should be a European Common Defence and Security Alliance
__label__noRel	The Russian Federation is our neighbor. We share common historic and cultural ties with them. Today the EU confronts Russia with sanctions. An understandable reaction to its actions in Ukraine and failing democracy. Let us not forget actions done by others (US intervention in Iraq, the Chinese in Tibet and their treatment of minorities, etc.). Yet we close our eyes.	We should not have illegal immigrants!
__label__noRel	Prohibiting washing machines without suitable filters will prevent groundwater pollution.	Ideology should be aimed at popularizing the best human qualities and stopping everything that is directed against a human
__label__noRel	Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language
__label__noRel	The defense of the equality of value and dignity of each and every single human life is decisive for the future of Europe.	We should not produce unnecessary garbage
__label__noRel	There is a lack of security and defense policy that can realistically be achieved by strengthening the Euro body as the 28th European army.	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU
__label__noRel	According to the United Nations Convention on the rights of people with disabilities, the European Union “shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities” on political decisions that concern them. Meanwhile the “European Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030” hardly mentioned people with intellectual and neurological disabilities. Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities. Ableism keeps getting perpetuated in the EU and it needs to stop. We want more representation! We want people with Down Syndrome to be fully included in the European Union institutions!	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration.	Every human has the right to receive reliable information about the movement and distribution of public funds

__label__noRel	Cheap and accessible train travel brings everyone closer together regardless of borders	We should promote the use of nuclear energy
__label__noRel	Why have several EU passports when they actually represent one and the same thing?	We should establish a European Army.
__label__noRel	We do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices. Innovation is failing and the best we can do is defend the status quo and the old people in power.	We should include young people in decision-making processes considering climate change
__label__noRel	Every human has the right to live. The developing child in the womb, the children, the adults, and those who are of old age and need nursing.	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.
__label__noRel	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps?	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__noRel	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.	The EU should establish a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
__label__noRel	We should arrange our cities, our economy, and politics so that it is easy for people to behave ecologically responsibly. It requires a lot of work now, but it is work that we have to do if we want to transition to something more sustainable.	We should establish a European Army.
__label__noRel	Europe has signed the UN charta on human rights. Also, Europe has the resources to design a fair and safe migration system so that the death of refugees in the Mediterranean sea stops.	Europe should stand together!
__label__noRel	No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly. Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this.	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable.	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed
__label__noRel	It is not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognizing patterns, reasons, and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in a vacuum. If it is easier and cheaper to live not sustainably, people will do it, even if they are conscious of the consequences.	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.
__label__noRel	Agreed. Only if we show that criminals don't have a place in the EU, we can convince our citizens that refugees aren't that much of a threat. Making the checking process that each refugee has to go through public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can just come here and we need to close our borders.	The EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom
__label__noRel	Europe is full and cannot accept more illegal migrants. Those persons must be sent back and have to ask for approval from their state of origin.	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__noRel	The organization of mass migration is a heinous crime. No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	We need a stand-alone European army.
__label__noRel	The more dynamic the economy, the stronger the innovation and worldwide influence the EU will have, including soft power.	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU
__label__noRel	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger.	There is a lack of unity in European migration policies.
__label__noRel	We can only employ people in understaffed job fields.	We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states
__label__noRel	I think that people should grow, learn and move into better-paid jobs. Today there are fantastic opportunities, e.g. Artificial General Intelligence is being built, and human anti-aging and even rejuvenation therapies are being developed: these are only a few areas where the most pressing need of humanity is being met. People should move into such jobs. For the manual work - there are robots coming. We should not try to distort market forces and stop development.	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses
__label__noRel	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us.	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees
__label__noRel	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people.	We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states
__label__noRel	Energy is a human right and free energy production is a human right as well.	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain
__label__noRel	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council. We have seen this many times when the EU-MS have tried to find a common stance on foreign policy issues but one has been able to deter the will of all the other countries. This is not a democratic way. The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election.	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.
__label__noRel	Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__noRel	To face future crises – from climate change over cancer to multi-resistant bacteria - we need a strong fundament of open research that will provide the solutions when needed.	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__noRel	the solution must be a combination of EU regulation of microplastics, producers proactively replacing microplastics with natural elements with the same functions, and consumers making more informed choices to reduce demand from products with microplastics.

__label__noRel	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should lose its government/EU funding.	There should be a better post-Brexit European Alliance
__label__noRel	Our Europe continent is in debt and doesn't have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to disregard our laws! We have enough poor people in Europe already and we need to take care of them!	We need better ways of migration.
__label__noRel	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece.	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.

__label__noRel	Both, a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism are overdue.	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.
__label__noRel	Absolutely right. Europe needs an army for continental defense. Conscription must be introduced at the European level. The army must have the most modern weapons to deter Russia, Turkey, and China.	We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.
__label__noRel	I have never heard anyone talking in Europe about world supremacy. So it seems kind of pointless that this is a goal of EU policy.	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__noRel	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now.	We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	Judeo-Christian values are the cornerstone of European civilization - they deserve special protection because they made us who we are today. Mass migration from people with cultures totally alien to Europe is the phenomenon that most threatens EU security and cohesion. Everyone's human rights must be respected, but illegal migrants are criminals and should be treated as such, not pampered. Mass migration must end.	We should ban wild animals in circuses
__label__noRel	How would the candidates be selected? One per country? That just makes it a tight race between the two countries with the largest population (assuming one vote per person). Why would e.g. a Greek person vote for a Swedish candidate? How would even a Swedish candidate campaign in such a way as to appeal to Greek voters?	We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users
__label__noRel	The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 Frenchman would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own above people whose countries the Americans have bombed to shreds.	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law
__label__noRel	Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd world countries. This includes fighting for climate justice and decreasing unequal wealth distribution between countries.	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__noRel	Several member states have been turned into dictatorships a year ago, and there is no sign of a return to democracy. Freezing temporarily their EU membership status is to be considered to those where there is no more freedom in crossing borders (BE), even inside borders (DE, FR), no more press freedom (most), no more debate (most), no more press or individual liberty.	There should be centers of excellence in science and education
__label__noRel	Respect for human rights and effort sharing, and solidarity should be common sense in EU member states. Unfortunately, they're not yet.	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax
__label__noRel	The bicycle should be the main mode of transport for a majority of citizens because it is faster, it is easier, it is healthier, it is cheaper, it is more convenient, and it is eco-friendly.

__label__noRel	So to support European citizens you want to take more money from them?	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	The idea of a circular economy could help us to tackle the problem of overconsumption and overproduction of waste.

__label__noRel	If Europe is going to have concentration camps again, they should be in Europe, in plain sight, for everyone to see.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean completely open borders.	Voting for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory
__label__noRel	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.	We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.
__label__noRel	The random radical constitutional foundation of the EU only riles hesitant populaces without solving a particular problem.	We should be aware of migration due to climate change

__label__noRel	Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the greatest existential threat to the EU. Even more so than the CO2 threat.	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__noRel	Fossil-sourced natural gas is as harmful as coal or oil. If it is sourced from fossil fuels, natural gas produces a net increase in CO2 in the atmosphere when burned.	There should be a common EU migration and asylum policy
__label__noRel	These products come mainly from large enterprises, which do not necessarily focus on environmental protection.	We need see nuclear energy as green energy
__label__noRel	Worldwide, nuclear power has prevented emissions of 240 billion tonnes of CO2 and prevented 1.8 million lives due to prevented air pollution (Kharecha, Hansen 2013).	International cooperation with third countries in the field of migration should be developed
__label__noRel	Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!	We do not want illegal migration.
__label__noRel	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
__label__noRel	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop, With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today.	Frontex should regularly publish transparency reports
__label__noRel	I totally agree, maybe would be glad if a press company could be sanctioned for misleading information, or even if it repeats, they could have their press licenses voided. It is crazy how much misleading information is out there, many people are sharing it and nobody is taking responsibility for it. In addition, there could be a discussion in which only verified users (real people) could have access to the press's online chat/discussion under the reported topic.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__noRel	The only meaningful immigration is when there is a member country with a specific vacancy. That member will also be responsible for the integration (at a cost of Euro 167,000). The EU has only to administer the paperwork and supervise if matters spin out of control.	We should make living wages a human right
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, in our society, a healthy person is not profitable. Pharma is a big business, doctors are being paid for prescribing drugs. Modern healthcare should be preventive. Doctors should be encouraged and paid for curing people and keeping them healthy. Good quality healthcare should be accessible in every part of the world and should be free as there is nothing more important than human life.	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	The EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life. To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.

__label__noRel	Economies within a short distance, decentralization, and localization can be efficient tools for protecting the climate and the environment. Less transportation, consumption of local resources, and a high level of self-reliance in the energy and food sector lead to lower carbon footprints.	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy
__label__noRel	The proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU

__label__noRel	Giving small countries 'veto rights' is a recipe for disaster that will keep the European Union separated and weak instead of united and reliable in policy making.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__noRel	Agreed. Only if we show that criminals don't have a place in the EU, we can convince our citizens that refugees aren't that much of a threat. Making the checking process that each refugee has to go through public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can just come here and we need to close our borders.	There should be a small council of people from all over the world, and identify the problems of every country and solve them.

__label__noRel	To begin with, stop using the labels “Europe” and “European” to name the EU institutions and initiatives. Do not forget that there are parts of the EU that are not part of Europe (the Spanish territories of the Canary Islands and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, for example, belong to Africa from a geographical point of view); also, that there are parts of Europe that do not belong to Europe (the UK and Switzerland, to name only two); the EU and Europe are not synonyms: Cyprus is a member state of the EU, but 'if' geographically it is Europe, so must be Turkey.	The EU should start accession negotiations with Russia

__label__noRel	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations.

__label__noRel	The migrants that are already (legally) here should be taught western values so they and their families can integrate/assimilate, as the age-old saying goes 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'.	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters

__label__noRel	I think the problem in the EU is the incompetence to establish inventions in the market. There are lots of inventions that are made and funded by public EU research facilities brought into the market by small startups. In the end, they are picked like ripe fruits by the US or Chinese companies where the big money is made.	NGO boats should have an government representative on board to make sure they aren't people trafficking

__label__noRel	What we are now seeing are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over years the population will have grown to 2,0 billion. That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today. At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear.

__label__noRel	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result.

__label__noRel	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.	The EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe.
__label__noRel	Mass migration is an evil that hurts the nations as well as the migrants themselves, who suffer indignities and risk their lives. We must end mass migration.

__label__noRel	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU. Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.	We should not subsidize large agricultural groups

__label__noRel	Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).	We should have all workers working in private enterprises share equity in the company they work for

The European Union should visible on the facades of the embassies and consulates of European countries.
__label__noRel	High voter turnout is usually desirable, but it's a symptom, not the root cause. Forcing people to go to the polls doesn't mean they will make more informed choices. Besides, voter turnout is a good metric that tells us where the potential problems of voter disenfranchisement are which is the first step to addressing them.	The EU should reduce its influence on its member states.

__label__noRel	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed
__label__noRel	Distance is very important when trading. Security is even more important in relation to distance. It is without thought to escalate conflict and it is not in the interest of Europe. Russia has centuries of history with European allies. It is in the interest of Europe to not leave Russia solely to China. We can all prosper.	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	Abortion kills a human being. It can be justified only in very rare cases.	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.
__label__noRel	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
__label__noRel	Nothing illustrates to me more the fall of European ethics than pro-abortion arguments. Nobody can dispute that a baby in the womb is alive and human, and yet people call their killing a 'human right'. How could we fall so low?	EU countries should slightly reduce health insurance contributions for all citizens who do not use tobacco products
__label__noRel	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work! What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights	EU countries should slightly reduce health insurance contributions for all citizens who do not use tobacco products
__label__noRel	Each country must have the right to choose based on a democratic vote, how many immigrants they want to accept. The question of immigrants depends on each country's reality and culture: this must be managed at the local level.	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants
__label__noRel	washing machines without proper filters are a major source of microplastic.	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	If we need work force, we should look for Europeans to come, not for Afrikans, Arabic, and Muslims.	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency
__label__noRel	Massive cuts to the research budget are leading to a tremendous brain drain and are destroying Europe as the home of scientific excellence.	We should use the waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain

__label__noRel	There has to be better funding for research, but it should not be administered top-down. Let researchers decide rather than politicians. Do not stifle research by bureaucracy. At the time being, with large consortia getting multi-million euro grants, the application process has become too complicated for most researchers. Rather invest in reproducible, transparent, open research.	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens

__label__noRel	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean completely open borders.	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing
__label__noRel	We must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.	We should create a pan-European train company
__label__noRel	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.	Migrants should be housed in EU bureaucrats' neighborhoods
__label__noRel	We should legalize drugs as a means to promote justice, harm reduction, and religious freedom. If we really want justice and human rights, this is absolutely essential.	We should create a European Wealth Fund
__label__noRel	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection
__label__noRel	Without increased financing of research, the movement toward better political, social and legal structures will falter.	We need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto.
__label__noRel	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should be required to provide financial support in dignified conditions.	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good
__label__noRel	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.	The European Union shall guarantee its territorial integrity against threats from Russia and shall seek to eliminate the influence of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe.
__label__noRel	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.	The EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states
__label__noRel	Halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU.	We should create a European Wealth Fund
__label__noRel	The EU leadership fails to carry out its fundamental duties: guard its border and protect its own people. Even 30 years after Schengen was introduced.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__noRel	Migrants depend on other countries' social systems.	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__noRel	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__noRel	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity. It would turn Europe into a polarized entity much like the American system and would firmly divide the European community on every issue.	EU countries should slightly reduce health insurance contributions for all citizens who do not use tobacco products
__label__noRel	Complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.	We should promote the use of nuclear energy

__label__noRel	A technology that takes 20 - 40 years to build up on any meaningful scale, and takes many decades to pay its costs, if ever?	We should include young people in decision-making processes considering climate change
__label__noRel	I can't endorse this. Esperanto isn't neutral. It favors Spanish speakers. Meanwhile, Slavic speakers are at a disadvantage. So why not one of the Slavic artificial languages?	We should sponsor the general population for taking in migrants
__label__noRel	Every human being has a conscience that allows them to recognize what is true and what is good, and it is by virtue of this awareness that we demand that no European Union funds be allocated to activities that destroy human embryos.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__noRel	Just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms
__label__noRel	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.	There should be a new EU foreign policy.
__label__noRel	The attempt to shove the postmodern version of liberalism down Europeans' throats has contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU.	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__noRel	The EU is in demographic decline. At the start of the 19th century, Europe accounted for 15% of the world's population. By 2050, it will be 5%.	We should increase the salaries of artisans
__label__noRel	Discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.	Europe must help Ukraine
__label__noRel	All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__noRel	All this lengthens the life cycle of a product and reduces waste.	We should increase the legal warranty from 2 years to 5 years on all products in Europe
__label__noRel	The future is 'work mobility'; thus we need to simplify taxation, enhance remote working opportunities, and enable inter-country recruitment for companies.	We should stop hosting migrants from Muslim countries
__label__noRel	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__noRel	The European Parliament is in dire need of reform. It has become a circus, where the MEPs engage in wild ideological posturing without substance. The EP's function is to address the pressing needs of EU citizens, but it hasn't done that for ages. One possible solution could be to replace it with a legislative body that is made up of delegates from member state parliaments.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__noRel	The EU should support democracies rather than dictatorships and value the support of democracy over economic gains.	We should develop a strategy for the EU defense in relation to NATO
__label__noRel	This is an attempt to combine the 'Multi-speed Europe' concept with the idea that European principles and values can be used as ideological clubs to beat those who engage in wrongthinking over the head with. If you insist on a set of shared EU principles and values that go beyond a mere symbolic declaration, these principles and values must include our real heritage: the Judeo-Christian values that have made Europe great. Traditional family values are first and foremost. All these values must be clearly defined in a legal sense.	The 19 June plenary meeting of the European Conference should mark a first step in the direction of a stronger and more united EU in the world
__label__noRel	This only works if you're young and healthy, otherwise, you're a bad risk for private health insurance and it will become even more expensive	We should adopt a single migration policy.
__label__noRel	The EU needs its own, united Army but not to fight in a war in Ukraine against a country whose leader is unpredictable and can use nuclear weapons against us.	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__noRel	We can only employ people in understaffed job fields.	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__noRel	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.	We should further develop robotization
__label__noRel	The only meaningful immigration is when there is a member country with a specific vacancy. That member will also be responsible for the integration (at a cost of Euro 167,000). The EU has only to administer the paperwork and supervise if matters spin out of control.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__noRel	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__noRel	Maybe while helping economic integration in Africa to happen, we will discover that we could go further in our own EU development. We could foster transnational companies which operate on both continents but not primarily the very big ones. I think of companies that supply solar power solutions to rural areas or microcredit banks. Create platforms where best choice and best practice solutions can evolve. This way, we can establish a single common market.	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__noRel	The migration pressure from Africa towards Europe results from a significant difference in perceived quality of life. It is in the interest of the EU and its member states to reduce that difference by working with the AU to level up and develop African nations.	We should tax heavily or refuse to import products not manufactured in the European Union that do not comply with our climate standards
__label__noRel	There are languages that are spoken by fewer people and are official	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__noRel	Indigenous Europeans have no obligation to take in any more migrants, and neither do they want to. This is being forced on us.	We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging
__label__noRel	Not many consumers are aware of how many of their products contain microplastics because producers deliberately hide this fact by only referring to the chemical names of microplastics on labels.	We need better ways of migration.
__label__noRel	Russia in the EU? No, thanks!	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste
__label__noRel	Without change, the EU will be following the route of the USSR and other communist countries, who after 70 years of trying to build a social paradise ended in poverty and suppression.	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__noRel	Pooling & Sharing increases the size, availability, the diversity of specific military resources but decreases their global cost at the same time	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__noRel	We need a real EU commitment to Policy Coherence for Peace. On one hand, the EU is promoting peace & dignity and on the other hand, there are investments in hard security tools (defense industry programs).	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU
__label__noRel	National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success. We need to be united, aligned, and, above all, independent from any extra-EU hegemon!	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.
__label__noRel	It's not a good idea to pursue further enlargement. The greater the territory, the harder it is to control and keep problems from appearing. Every large empire in history fell because it grew to such size that it couldn't be properly managed and ruled over. Examples from history don't become suddenly invalid because we're living in the 21st century.	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__noRel	the solution must be a combination of EU regulation of microplastics, producers proactively replacing microplastics with natural elements with the same functions, and consumers making more informed choices to reduce demand from products with microplastics.	The EU should focus on pragmatism
__label__noRel	No more immigration from non-European or non-first world countries.	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research. This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic. These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.	We should establish a Russian interest including EU policy.

We should create a pan-European train company
__label__noRel	That's a terrible idea. The government propaganda machine is already going at full steam. Do you have any idea what the psychological impact of these kinds of messages is when you blast them at people all day every day for over a year? Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick. Instead, they have willfully created panic. Just like your ad would.	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__noRel	In a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__noRel	Yes, but the problem is: Just because a product can be recycled, it does not mean that it always will be recycled. Let's assume that there would be a really climate friendly way to recycle batteries. Still people could throw those into landfills. How does the score deal with this?	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__noRel	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress.

__label__noRel	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__noRel	Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd world countries.

We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__noRel	I agree. Young people should have a voice in policymaking. Regulation needs to reduce forms of precarious work.

__label__noRel	Wood should be used as building material & other meaningful products only. Anything else is a waste of resources. No fresh wood for paper, fast furniture	We need a better distribution of refugees
__label__noRel	This is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.

Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare

__label__noRel	Esperanto is linguistically neutral: The language was created with the principle of internationality in a European context. It’s democratic: There are no native speakers of Esperanto, or better yet not any monolingual speakers of Esperanto. Everyone has to learn it as a second language.

Everyone is respected regardless of their origin and not discouraged from learning the language.	Alternative medicine should be more accepted
__label__noRel	There is a reason why these states don't want to join the common currency: their economies are more flexible and doing far better without it.

We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making
__label__noRel	The language barrier and a weak influence on local thinking, allow local propaganda to pass on distorted and untrue information about what is happening in the EU to their citizens.

We should increase the legal warranty from 2 years to 5 years on all products in Europe
__label__noRel	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border.	The EU should join NATO

__label__noRel	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced. When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.	We should adopt an extension of the application of qualified majority voting arrangements
__label__noRel	It would be a better idea to abolish the European Parliament. It has become an ideological Kabuki Theatre.
