__label__Position	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__Support	The EU has some rules on how social security systems are coordinated (Regulation 883/2004/EC). EU rules ensure that the pension rights accrued in each country are added together and paid out by the pension insurance institution of the Member State of affiliation. But the bureaucratic nightmare is probably just as guaranteed. A better solution would be a transparent and digital platform that collects pension entitlements from all EU member states. That way, every citizen would have an overview of his or her pension entitlements at all times, not just until when they are due.
__label__Support	I find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice. Just as I can move myself, my family, furniture, car, and bank accounts freely within the EU, I should have the same right to move and merge my pensions into a single unit.

__label__Support	we should limit it, laws should not be changed for special circumstances
__label__Support	judicial activism provides a limited view of procedure
__label__Support	Judicial activism should be limited as there should be enough statutes of law to allow for most situations and fixed punishments are more acceptable than an individuals response to a case.

__label__Support	judicial activism is dangerous in that it allows for personal opinion to possibly get in the way of true justice. personal opinion clouding what is law should not be allowed.

__label__Position	There should be a federal Constitution for a European Federation
__label__Support	The EU is established on treaties, but treaties have no soul. Only a constitution has a soul, provided it is well designed: from, by, and for the people.
__label__Support	People are willing to volunteer change in relation to involuntary inflicted changes, such as technology, economy, and climate. With this in mind, I hope a European Constitution will be long-lasting and help the people. We have to react to the circumstances and start fast.
__label__Position	We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering
__label__Position	We should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools
__label__Attack	zero telerance policied do not address underlying causes for the behaviour that is causing the issue
__label__Support	children need to learn boundaries and consequences for their actions. they learn faster if there is immediate repercussions than if you let them do it over and over again.
__label__Support	a zero tolerance policy at school is a good idea because children need to be disciplined as it might cut crime in the future.
__label__Support	bullies should not be given second chances. being victim to school bullying is a major risk factor for developing mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.
__label__Support	a zero tolerance policy will scare the children into behaving and following the rules.
__label__Attack	the zero-tolerance policy is not a good thing at all , kids getting punished for their actions and humiliated in front of a audience is really not the great thing to do.
__label__Support	zero-tolerance policies keep schools safer by immediately removing the problem
__label__Attack	students should be able to state their opinions and by so learn to mature. by punishing at first sign of disobedience we are just have conformity not learning.
__label__Support	zero-tolerance policies are helpful as they stop children misbehaving
__label__Attack	it is unfair on those being bullied to punish them the same as you punish the bully
__label__Attack	zero tolerance leaves no room for individual cases where it may do more harm than good
__label__Attack	as americans we are granted the right of due process. sometimes there are extenuating circumstances that must be taken into account.
__label__Support	all schools should adopt a zero-tolerance policy as kids need to know they can not act inappropriately at any given moment when in school.
__label__Support	zero tolerance sets a clear and specific guideline for all to adhere to
__label__Attack	schools already have systems and hierarchies, there is no need to employ further policies.
__label__Support	Some violent and extreme behaviours in schools deserve a fierce and sharp reaction.
__label__Attack	we shouldn't adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools because a misunderstanding can cause innocent students to be suspended or expelled
__label__Support	zero-tolerance must be mandatory in school and is only way to stop negative stuff which happens so often in schools.
__label__Attack	however these policies can impede the advancement of children from troubled backgrounds or with additional needs. they need a safe place to learn in a positive behaviours in a supportive environment.
__label__Support	it makes a school a safe place for children to learn
__label__Support	Zero-tolerance policies may seem unfair to the individual but bad and risky behavior at schools spreads faster than wildfire. Sometimes we must make an example of an individual for the greater good.
__label__Support	i agree that a zero-tolerance policy in schools is a good idea since it would mean that our children are safer when they go to school.
__label__Attack	a zero-tolerance policy gives administrators no leeway if a student commits a less than serious crime.
__label__Attack	We should not adopt zero tolerance policies because they have not improved school discipline in other districts, only introduced more punishments for students.
__label__Support	a zero-tolerance policy in schools shows children that the schools are not playing around when it comes to punishment
__label__Support	we need to keep other kids safe in schools by enforcing a zero-tolerance policy in schools. we can't have drugs or weapons in our schools and give those kids a pass.
__label__Attack	teaching children to think for themselves and learn based on their own actions is important to their growth. stunting them with zero-tolerance does no one any favors.
__label__Attack	the brain of a child isn't fully developed and it isn't fair to have such harsh penalties on them
__label__Support	i think it is a very appropriate method given the physical and psychological violence that exists in schools today.
__label__Attack	children will make mistakes, because they are not mature. we have to allow some discretion in the hands of the administrators
__label__Attack	students are not yet adults, and circumstances are unique for each child.
__label__Attack	people make mistakes and should be given a second chance. a zero-tolerance policy in school would not teach the student a lesson, it would just rid the school of the problem.
__label__Attack	each case needs to be reviewed independently and punishments then established.
__label__Support	by adopting a zero-tolerance policy in schools we can cut bullying out since those who do it will be removed from the school.
__label__Attack	we don't need a zero-tolerance policy that punishes students harshly for small things
__label__Attack	A zero tolerance policy in schools is a very old fashioned theory, and it has failed over and over again.
__label__Attack	the school is designed to educate not to accept student abuse
__label__Attack	a zero tolerance policy is unfair for minimal infractions.
__label__Attack	we shouldn't adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools because it could cause kids to be wrongfully punished due to misunderstandings for example protecting themselves against a bully
__label__Support	a zero-tolerance policy in schools provides a structured and safe environment for children to learn.
__label__Attack	zero-tolerance results in an overly disciplinarian approach, and is unable to distinguish between all the subtle gradations of rule-breaking.
__label__Support	zero-tolerance policies are the only effective system to keep schools safe from the threats of drugs and school shootings
__label__Support	we should adopt a zero tolerance because it will keep the children in check.
__label__Support	We should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools as children of school age are in a formative state and will learn good lessons for life including what is and isn't allowed in a good society.
__label__Attack	a zero-tolerance policy gives no leeway for administrators in cases where the crime may not be so serious.
__label__Attack	there are always exceptions to everything so zero-tolerance policies are not good because it doesn't allow for any exceptions.
__label__Attack	a zero-tolerence is too harsh, children get reprimanded for even the most innocent act.
__label__Support	a zero-tolerance policy within schools will help support a healthy environment where students do not feel threatened due to the differences (or perceived differences).
__label__Support	adopting a zero tolerance rule in schools is good for safety.
__label__Support	this would show that schools are serious about stamping out bullying and bad behavior. too many people get away with bad things because schools are scared to punish them.
__label__Support	zero-tolerance policies provide a safe space
__label__Attack	in many cases punishment does not match crime
__label__Support	Zero-tolerance policy works- Think of schools three decades ago, when the policy was prevalent. As a result children were obedient and disciplined, as opposed to students' behaviour today, using moderd soft approaches in schools.
__label__Support	zero-tolerance policies ensures pupils know exactly where they are in terms of rules and regulations leaving no room for ambiguity, thus ensuring better behaviour.
__label__Attack	We should not adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools- children need more tolerance in their lives in order to flourish, and creating a zero-tolerance policy will cause harm and suffering.
__label__Support	a zero tolerance policy will lead to safer schools by removing troublemakers immediately
__label__Attack	we need to remember we are talking about children not criminals, this policy is far too harsh and unnecessary. let children be children.
__label__Support	adopting a zero tolerance in schools will help reduce the amount of bullying that happens.
__label__Support	the security of child and teachers is esential for all
__label__Attack	Zero-tolerance policies leave no room for explaining mitigating circumstances, which is both unfair to the individual being punished and also sends a negative message to the school community as a whole.
__label__Support	this is the only way to maintain order
__label__Support	it is a good measure, since our youth currently lack responsibility and discipline, and with this we favor more that ability
__label__Support	we should adopt a zero-tolerance policy to protect all of our children.
__label__Support	zero tolerance in schools to avoid further shootings and also to avoid cases of bullying
__label__Support	this would ensure everyone got punished if they broke a rule
__label__Support	zero tolerance policies remove troublemakers from schools before they become an even larger problem, which improves the learning environment for other students.
__label__Support	we should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools then all the children will more likely behave
__label__Support	an effective measure to avoid bullying is to adopt zero tolerance and more severe punishments
__label__Attack	zero-tolerance policies have been shown to be disproportionately applied to minority students.
__label__Attack	there should be some leeway for pupils otherwise they will have no grounding for future life if all they know is what they can't do and cannot question it.
__label__Support	zero-tolerance policies in schools allow for a safer, bully-free environment.
__label__Support	We should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools since the current system clearly isn't working and needs a drastic, non tolerant change.
__label__Attack	children are still growing and forming their own personalities - a zero-tolerance policy allows no room for mistakes, at a time when children are testing boundaries and they need some flexibility to develop
__label__Support	we should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools because it will scare kids into behaving
__label__Support	zero tolerance will improve educational standards and behaviour leading to better learning outcomes.
__label__Attack	a zero-tolerance policy in schools is the wrong way to go as it would too often cause innocent students being punished for being pushed too far.
__label__Support	a zero tolerance policy in schools would cut down on bullying and fighting.
__label__Support	Zero tolerance parties have the appearance of fairness, which increases buy-in to the disciplinary system from otherwise skeptical parents and community leaders.
__label__Support	adopting zero-tolerance in school will solve the big issues which schools all around country face it today.
__label__Support	a zero-tolerance policy in school would improve behaviour and thus improve results.
__label__Support	being permissive of disruptive behavior is unfair to well-behaved students.
__label__Attack	students who are suspended will loose out on classes and might fail exams or even drop out of school as a result.
__label__Support	we should adopt a zero-tolerance policy because it will keep kids disciplined and the schools will be safer
__label__Support	we need to have the safest possible learning environment, as this enables students to perform at their best.
__label__Support	teachers and children should feel safe in schools and a zero-tolerance policy will be beneficial for all.
__label__Support	there is an increase in anti-social behaviour and lack of respect among schoolchildren these days so a zero-tolerance policy will quickly teach them to respect the rule and people in general
__label__Attack	kids needs their freedom and to learn from mistakes
__label__Attack	kids in schools are not always mature enough to understand the consequences of their actions. a zero-tolerance policy would just be punishing students that need the most guidance.
__label__Attack	a zero-tolerance policy in schools shouldn't be adopted because the smallest little unimportant things could lead to a student being suspended.
__label__Attack	zero tolerance can punish children unreasonably due to the lack of flexibility where a child could for instance be suspended just for bringing a rubber band into school which could be classed as a weapon.
__label__Support	dangerous items should not be allowed in schools because it is endangers the students and faculty and a strict punishment would help prevent these items from being brought.
__label__Support	Zero tolerance policies send a strong signal to students, parents, and the community that violence and bullying will not be tolerated.
__label__Attack	zero-tolerance policy is too harsh not letting a way for even a minor fault. students are terrorized and are no more comfortable for studying
__label__Attack	we should not adopt a zero-tolerance policy because it is too restricting and suppressing.
__label__Attack	it has been shown that children are at a higher risk of dropping out of school if there is a zero-tolerance policy in place
__label__Support	zero tolerance policies lead to better outcomes in schools
__label__Attack	being too harsh creates a negative environment which is bad for children so there should be some flexibility to avoid a zero-tolerance policy in schools.
__label__Attack	if a zero tolerance policy in schools is adopted, this will impinge on the rights of the pupils to challenge decisions they may deem unfair or unfit.
__label__Attack	zero tolerance policies don't allow for adminstrators to use their judgement to administer punishment
__label__Support	Zero tolerance policies provide a consistent framework for discipline, to ensure that issues are treated with the gravity they deserve.
__label__Support	zero-tolerance policy should be adopted to teach children disciplined and to help prepare them for a life where rules apply.
__label__Attack	students from schools with active zero tolerance policy have occasionally blurted about how the policy infringes on their rights and how teachers use the policy as an excuse to deal with them.
__label__Attack	we should not adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools because some of the teachers would misuse the policy
__label__Support	adopting a zero-tolerance policy helps to combat violence and drug abuse in schools
__label__Position	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people
__label__Support	The situation of young people is difficult. Temporary jobs, precarious contracts, civic contracts replacing regular employment, forced self-employment, lack of basic social protection, and even age-discriminatory practices (also on the basis of age) are still the norm for millions of young people who are trying to make their way in the labor market. They need urgent help!
__label__Support	I agree. Young people should have a voice in policymaking. Regulation needs to reduce forms of precarious work. It is time to expand collective bargaining coverage to all forms of work. It is essential to introduce a right to decent housing and policies capping rents and limiting property market speculation. we urgently need investment to achieve this. Youth is the future, we have to take care of it.
__label__Support	A lot of programs nowadays sound really good on paper, but there always is someone bending the rules. There needs to be outside monitoring in every youth program of that sort
__label__Support	We see this problem in many countries and the situation is getting worse - the pandemic, also, took its toll. Stable quality jobs and adequate social protection are necessary if we don't want to see a great strain on social systems in the long term.
__label__Support	To prevent precarious conditions, we must put in place quality standards, they must be binding for all jobs created under EU and National recovery plans. Better monitoring and trade union involvement are needed to assess and report youth unemployment and NEET rates. At the moment these numbers hide forced mobility, involuntary part-time employment, and work in a grey and informal economy. Urgent measures are needed to fight youth unemployment and precarious working conditions in sectors where young people are overrepresented (tourism; gig economy...).
__label__Support	I agree. Stable, quality jobs and adequate social protection for everyone are necessary. Trade unions have many proposals to achieve more equal and inclusive labor markets. This goes hand in hand with policies to promote more equal, sustainable, and inclusive societies.
__label__Support	We cannot afford a lost generation, so we need to invest in quality jobs and young people for our future!
__label__Support	The problem of youth employment has been there for a long time but was underlined again during the pandemic. Many young people are forced to move to a different country in order to find work.
__label__Support	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.
__label__Support	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people. It is embedded in the core principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but those high and lofty principles must become a reality for all workers, old and young!
__label__Position	The European Union should hold a referendum to decide on immigration
__label__Support	Absolutely right! If the eurocrats cared about what the people want, they'd ask them.
__label__Position	We do not want illegal migration.
__label__Attack	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.

__label__Position	Censorship of movies is an outdated concept
__label__Support	Through censorship, money power will rule society. It's a fact that rich people influence politics.
__label__Support	Filmmakers spend lot of money and time to make movies. If parts of the movie is cut in the name of censorship, they will be discouraged to make more movies.
__label__Support	Censorship causes imposition of majoritarian ideals on others.
__label__Position	There should be no illegal migration
__label__Support	Entering the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right to receive asylum.
__label__Support	We must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.
__label__Support	This is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.

__label__Support	An EU army independent from NATO and its US commanders is critical to strategic autonomy and avoiding being dragged into destructive US wars in the Middle East like in the past.
__label__Position	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__Position	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities
__label__Support	Esperanto is politically neutral: it is not used by any European nation. Although there is some culture connected to the language, there is no political or economic power imposing it. Also, where English is connected to the US, Canada, Australia, and other countries, Esperanto would be a truly European language.
__label__Support	To build a common European understanding and to create a European identity, we need our own common language.
__label__Support	Esperanto is linguistically neutral: The language was created with the principle of internationality in a European context. It’s democratic: There are no native speakers of Esperanto, or better yet not any monolingual speakers of Esperanto. Everyone has to learn it as a second language. As a result of this nobody will have an advantage over others and nobody can feel like a 'stranger' since nobody can feel like a 'native'. Everyone is respected regardless of their origin and not discouraged from learning the language.
__label__Position	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__Support	Norway and Iceland can provide their external point of view toward EU policy at the conference. But why only Norway and Iceland? Why not Switzerland? Why not the recognized candidates? And maybe even UK! I'm sure there are many lessons to learn from their experience in the EU and from the Brexit
__label__Position	We should build a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network
__label__Position	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Attack	Almost 3 lakh people were employed in the firecracker industry in these places, and 5 lakh people in packaging, transporting, distributing, and selling these crackers. Thus, the ban would also mean huge unemployment in these states.
__label__Attack	Bursting crackers on Diwali has always been on the to-do list in every family. A Deepavali without firecrackers will definitely be a cut-down in entertainment and recreation for the kids, as well as the elders.
__label__Support	Banning firecrackers in some places currently having pollution at its peak like Delhi-NCR will obviously bring down the poisonous emission of gases which has deadly effects on the entire balanced ecosystem. The highest level of particulate matter recorded in Delhi was 2.5 in the year 2016, which indeed made Delhi the most polluted city in the world in terms of air pollution. The “Central Pollution Control Board” also stated that the level of sulfur dioxide in the air gets tremendously high between 9 p.m. till midnight during Deepavali.
__label__Support	The crackers regulated in the market comprise chemical components like saltpeter, carbon, and sulfur. When these are ignited altogether, hazardous oxides of gases are emitted which cause suffocation, reduce visibility, and other health hazards. Medical experts state that the air gets contaminated with toxic gases and remains for days after Diwali. The toxic elements that reach the lungs, cannot be removed thereafter and can cause grave health issues. This will cause long-term effects on children.
__label__Attack	With the ban, religious sentiments get triggered too. In 2017, the Hindu community raised questions about the ban on Christmas trees on Christmas, or slaughter of lamb on Eid, or colors on Holi, etc., thinking it to be against their communal practices.
__label__Support	As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.
__label__Position	We should be realistic wrt. migration.
__label__Position	We need to develop a partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__Support	Agreed, BUT only on one condition: that every euro be spent under the joint control of local and European officers. There's so much corruption in Africa that otherwise of every 100 euros sent there, at least 80 would end up in the pockets of corrupt officers. And in that case, it's better to not send anything.
__label__Position	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain
__label__Position	We should support agroforestry
__label__Position	We should adopt a single migration policy.
__label__Support	We must move towards full co-decision power for the European Parliament and the abolition of unanimity for climate, energy, social affairs, and taxation policies.

__label__Support	It would be easier if the EU joined NATO. The internal rivalry between the single EU states would stop. Also, the issue of a legitimate European army would be solved.

__label__Position	Doctors should be paid based on how many people they successfully treated
__label__Support	Unfortunately, in our society, a healthy person is not profitable. Pharma is a big business, doctors are being paid for prescribing drugs. Modern healthcare should be preventive.

__label__Position	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East.
__label__Support	I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.

__label__Position	We should abolish covid digital pass
__label__Attack	More illegal and legal migration will lead to more unemployment, lower wages, more insecurity, and less sustainable social systems.
__label__Support	Respect for human rights and effort sharing, and solidarity should be common sense in EU member states. Unfortunately, they're not yet.
__label__Attack	I disagree, each country must be sovereign to establish its migration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.
__label__Support	Across the EU, young people are continuing to face a number of significant challenges to enter and get a stable position in the labor market. They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are particularly affected. So we need a fairer migration policy but also consider migrant needs (and challenges) in other policy areas.
__label__Support	The shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens. And it is not in line with the fundamental rights the EU is supposed to put into practice.
__label__Support	In the EU labor market we will need more workers from outside Europe to continue the level of economic activities we are planning.
__label__Support	There is a need for a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not moved an inch since 2019. There have been attempts of making progress in adopting a common European asylum system and forming an EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while also stressing its aim to closely monitor migration routes and maintain situational awareness. This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.
__label__Attack	The EU should treat economic migrants with more vigilance. They cannot be the solution to the aging European population. We need more focus on border control to curb illegal migration.
__label__Support	The human rights-based approach should be the core principle. Legal channels for entry and fostering an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as key tools to address the social impact of migration flows are necessary.
__label__Support	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.
__label__Support	Although there is an immense increase in the number of TCN migrant workers, there is no adequate policy in protecting their rights. Anyone in Europe should be entitled to the same worker’s rights, no matter where they come from. As migration is an issue that is dealt with by all countries, we must find a common answer at the EU level.
__label__Support	The Dublin Agreement leaves EU member states with an external border completely alone to deal with the challenge of immigration. This must stop! Not only because solidarity in the EU is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overburdening of states left alone with this challenge creates intolerable situations for the refugees.
__label__Attack	Before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have nice conditions in the EU, we should first focus on ensuring that our own people can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.
__label__Attack	Each country must have the right to choose based on a democratic vote, how many immigrants they want to accept. The question of immigrants depends on each country's reality and culture: this must be managed at the local level.
__label__Attack	We should not bring the problem to Europe, but we should rather help where it is needed in their region!
__label__Attack	Giving immigrants more rights will lead to the forced displacement and eventual erasure of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what's happening to the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China is genocide then so is this. This idea proposal is not grassroots, it's astroturfed lies to hide the fact that our migration policies are totally undemocratic and forced onto native Europeans.
__label__Support	A fair, sustainable, and open Europe benefits everyone. Our common future demands actions to put human rights, solidarity, and social justice on top of the agenda.
__label__Attack	The nations must have the final say regarding whom they want to allow to live on their sovereign territories.
__label__Position	We should implement a climate score for products
__label__Position	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__Position	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__Support	And not just the batteries. The EU should have an overall policy with a clear goal to restrict and reduce planned obsolescence.
__label__Support	Having to replace an entire mobile phone (or tablet, camera, notebook, etc.) because a battery reached the end of its useful life is infuriating. It is not just a strain on consumers' wallets, it is also devastating for the environment, as the energy and resources going into manufacture of electronics is artificially increased through the short lifespans these devices have.

__label__Support	we should abolish intellectual property rights because we never can truly know that someone came up with something.
__label__Support	intellectual property rights are expensive to maintain and hold back the spread of new ideas
__label__Attack	intellectual property rights mean that the people who come up with ideas or products get the financial gains from said product and so makes people more likely to innovate
__label__Support	intellectual property rights should be abolished as they stifle innovation and allows the creation of monopolies and giant corporations
__label__Support	also called intellectual plagiarism none of this makes sense there may be people who think the same and that is not a crime
__label__Support	intellectual property rights create a monopoly position for a company which enables them to charge whatever they like for a product without fear of competition. it prices the poor out of markets

__label__Support	Due to the inactive lifestyle and stressful lives, many people are getting lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. Fit India Movement can encourage people to consume healthy food and maintain physical and mental fitness.
__label__Support	With high-quality advertisements and marketing practices, junk food manufacturers are manipulating children to buy their foods. This Fit India Movement will make children think about the negative consequences of junk food. As a result, this movement will encourage children to consume healthy food.
__label__Support	Some parents put too much stress on children to study. They send their children to tuition after school or just make them sit to do homework forgetting the importance of free time to play.

__label__Support	This movement has the potential to make more people embrace traditional Indian martial art forms like Kathi Samu, Musti Yudha, etc, and traditional dance forms and also healthy Indian snacks. And as a byproduct, this may result in creating some jobs.
__label__Attack	The motivation to maintain fitness should start from childhood. But in India, many schools lack playgrounds. Lack of playgrounds may push children to turn to inactive lifestyles.
__label__Attack	‘Fit India Movement’ may not reach the people of below poverty line. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, both physical activity and nutritious food are necessary. But in India, still many people are malnourished and some people do not have access to safe drinking water. So, without solving the issue of poverty and lack of access to affordable nutritious food, a section of people in India will not be able to take advantage of this movement.

Generally, many people want to maintain an active lifestyle, but all they need is some encouragement. So, this movement constantly reminds people to focus on fitness goals just like Swachh Bharat reminds us of the importance of keeping our surroundings clean.
__label__Attack	We haven't got enough jobs and money for everyone in Europe! Stop immigration! However, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia have it! These countries can therefore welcome migrants instead of funding hundreds of mosques in Europe!
__label__Attack	Why do we even let in migrants who do not speak the language of the country where they wish to reside? Migration is bad for the nations and degrading for the migrants. We must work to end mass migration.
__label__Attack	Indigenous Europeans have no obligation to take in any more migrants, and neither do they want to. This is being forced on us.
__label__Support	It's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).
__label__Support	Each migrant in the European Union must be given the possibility to integrate even if the refugee status is not clear. Integration programs could support this development in all cases.
__label__Attack	No, Europe is not a colony. Immigration has been devastating. Public EU officials who support immigration should be named and the European people must be given a democratic opportunity to remove them from positions of power and influence.
__label__Attack	We have millions of poor true Europeans that we can help, why help migrant who have nothing in common with us?
__label__Support	Most of the time migrants have trouble fitting into society because of the language barrier and hate. Providing them with language lessons could reduce the tensions around migration, and improve the migrants' integration.
__label__Support	Knowledge of the host country's language is essential for integration. When migrants understand the local language, studies show that their values tend towards those of the host countries over time.
__label__Support	It is essential that European principles and values are taught to migrants, including an explanation of the reasoning behind these principles and values. It would be best that this is provided both in the person's mother tongue and in the language of the host country.
__label__Attack	For more than 50 years immigration has been going on uncontrolled and unchecked. No changes need to be made before we have an agreement that people ignoring our immigration laws should be detained in repatriation facilities with no chance of re-entering the EU. Once we agree on that we can start talking about funds and resources for those who do deserve help.
__label__Support	Working in sectors in ample need of workers, such as the agricultural fields, will help to integrate immigrants once their situation has been legalized. And above all, education is needed, an intensive integration education both in the language (of course) and also culture: history, philosophy, literature, etc.
__label__Attack	Europe needs more women to have children and raise them in a good manner, which helps transmit our culture: our culture is a praise to the world and must be saved from globalization invasion and destruction.
__label__Position	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good
__label__Support	The huge data we produce every day is analyzed and fed into our devices through algorithms that we end up giving more and more control of our lives to the gadgets. We may feel that we receive all these services for free, but they come at the cost of our precious time and attention.
__label__Support	With all the data and algorithms our apps and gadgets, without our conscious knowledge, are making decisions for us. Decision-making is (was) one of the qualities that made humans different from others
__label__Support	After a daily 10-hour shift from Monday to Friday most of us prefer to stay at home on the holidays. We surround ourselves with laptops, TV, and mobile and use them in cycles for Netflix, sports, social media, etc. (thinking that we are relaxing) rather than going out. We prefer and are more comfortable with online chatting instead of talking to people for real. There are fewer meaningful relationships nowadays because of all the above factors. We have started preferring isolation.
__label__Support	Nuclear technology is a very efficient alternative to non-renewable energy resources. But still, we chose to move ahead with more and more types of nuclear warheads. The same is the case with almost every other invention. Similarly, though initially, AI promised better lives for us, because of AI, we have started losing our basic human qualities.
__label__Support	We have started losing our basic human habits and instincts, and are actually governed by devices and apps.

__label__Support	students that work hard to get a degree should not start out their journey into the real world, in debt

__label__Support	student loans is a type of aid that is given to them in order to help lower their expenses and debts
__label__Support	student loans should be subsidized so that more kids can go to school, get a better education and contribute to the advancement of society.

__label__Support	subsidised student loans would encourage everyone to go to university if they thought they wouldn't have any debt at the end of the studies.
__label__Attack	there are more important ways we should be using public money, such as housing and healthcare.
__label__Attack	students loans should not be subsidized as it is a students choosing to continue to go to school on their own accord and whim, not a requirement to be the burden of others.
__label__Attack	we should not pay for other peoples life style choices
__label__Support	in the interests of raising the education level of our population we should subsidize student loans.

__label__Attack	student loans should not be subsidized as the enhanced education they receive will allow the students to go on to better paying jobs.
__label__Support	subsidizing student loans will enable many more people the opportunity to attend college

__label__Support	providing help in paying student loans will lift a financial burden off of students and allow them to become more indepedent.

__label__Support	by subsidizing student loans we can remove one of the stressors from continuing education.
__label__Support	Student loan costs are becoming outrageous putting people in debt for life.
__label__Attack	we should not subsidize student loans because people need to work hard to get their education
__label__Attack	if we subsidize student loans we could create parasites that never get a degree just to maintain the state subsidy
__label__Support	it is important that student loans are granted, because it helps you increase your quality of life and your economic potential
__label__Support	the cost of an education is unaffordable for those who might most benefit from it
__label__Support	higher education should be a right; subsidized student loans provides all who want to learn with access to an education
__label__Support	subsidizing student loans would allow those who previously could not afford to go to university, the opportunity to better themselves with good qualifications.
__label__Attack	Student loans are fundamentally a commercial transaction and have no place being subsidized.
__label__Support	subsidizing student loans lets the students work in their classes not at jobs to pay for their education
__label__Attack	students should pay for their own education; it isn't fair that everyone has to pay for education through tax regardless of whether they use it.
__label__Attack	student loans can be expensive and put young people in debt
__label__Support	the new generations need the opportunity to advance in their preparation, that is why if they do not have the means and the state does not provide free education then it should promote means such as loans.
__label__Support	student loans take many years to pay off and if we don't subsidize there will be less students willing to go to college.
__label__Support	we should subsidize students loans so that more kids can get a better education, they are the future after all and we will need doctors, engineers, scientists, etc.
__label__Support	student loan debt is an enormous pressure on working people, and should be subsidized.
__label__Attack	graduates earn more over a lifetime than their peers, this gives them plenty of opportunity to repay their debts.
__label__Support	for some students taking a student loan is the only way to afford studying
__label__Support	students need help with the burden of college costs and shouldn't have to go into crippling debt to get an education.
__label__Attack	the public should not pay for other peoples lifestyle choices
__label__Attack	people choose to go to college. those that do should pay the bills for that schooling. we should not be taxed to give money to those that choose to borrow it.
__label__Attack	it isn't the obligation of anyone to assist students with the costs of their education. if a student wants to get an education they have to realize it comes at a cost and won't be given for free.
__label__Support	All young people whether rich or poor should have the opportunity to better their lives by going to into higher education, the more student loans are subsidized the closer this will become a reality.
__label__Support	subsidized student loans allow for those from pooer backgrounds to achieve a good standard of education and progress in their lives
__label__Support	most people can't afford to go to college, and we don't want them to graduate with massive debts
__label__Attack	if people want to go to college, they need to work hard and earn enough to go
__label__Support	we need to make it more accessible for the public to acquire education, as opposed to adding more barriers such as extreme student debt.
__label__Support	graduates should not have to start their career with a massive debt to pay off
__label__Support	helping younger generations is obligatory for us and helping them we helping our future.
__label__Support	student loans are a massive burden for people getting the degrees necessary to qualify for a job to become a productive member of society.
__label__Attack	the national debt is out of control and we cannot afford to add to it further.
__label__Support	student loans should be subsidized because no human being should start their adult life off with thousands of dollars in debt, it's not fair
__label__Support	a student does not have the resources to pay for the high cost of college
__label__Attack	wider availability of student loans creates a glut of over-educated, under-employed individuals contributing less to society - money would be better investing in vocational education.
__label__Attack	we should not because it would cost the country millions of pounds and raise everyone's taxes, so the cost of living would go up.
__label__Attack	student loans shouldn't be subsidized because you're limited in the amount that you can borrow
__label__Support	student loans should be subsidized to allow thos students from poorer backgrounds to get a good education and improve themselves
__label__Support	students are graduating with huge college loans that make it difficult for them to get started when they leave school.
__label__Attack	people knew when they took out the loan that they'd have to pay it back. they should be responsible, just as other people are for mortgages and car loans.

__label__Support	student loans are a good deal for students, student loans allow for some students go to school that may have not been able to go to school before
__label__Support	better education is good for the nation
__label__Attack	student loan debt is crippling our young people's ability to fully participate in the economy
__label__Support	student loans are so unreasonibly expensive we need to help students with them.

__label__Attack	student loans should not be subsidized just because people chose to go to colleges that we beyond their means.
__label__Attack	no need to subsidize student loans, people can access education by using their own money and time
__label__Support	due to the obligations of the students it is sometimes difficult to get a job, we must help them pay their loans so that they do not leave school
__label__Attack	higher education is not an inherent right. if someone wants to go to college, they should pay for it. the burden shouldn't simply be put on taxpayers instead.
__label__Attack	subsidizing student loans would allow access to funds above the means of the student and the financial consequences in the future, including higher interest rates would be financially detrimental.
__label__Attack	There has to be better funding for research, but it should not be administered top-down. Let researchers decide rather than politicians. Do not stifle research by bureaucracy. At the time being, with large consortia getting multi-million euro grants, the application process has become too complicated for most researchers. Rather invest in reproducible, transparent, open research.
__label__Position	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Position	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__Support	The idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy.
__label__Support	It should be the common goal of EU diplomacy to change the workings of the UN as it is. The security council is a relict of the emerging post-WW2 order and the influence of the Cold War.
__label__Position	Homeschooling should be banned
__label__Position	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.
__label__Position	We should have psychological counseling in educational institutions
__label__Support	In general, a few teachers punish students, who are not scoring well in exams but they do not even try to understand whether they have any learning disabilities. This causes self-esteem issues in students. Psychologists can detect these learning disabilities and can detect these issues and can collaborate with teachers to draft teaching strategies that are suitable for students with learning disabilities.
__label__Support	Many students struggle with several issues such as anxiety, self-esteem issues, trouble forming friendships, etc. Guidance and support are very important to help them overcome these problems. So, educational institutions should have mental health professionals to help students.
__label__Support	In 2020, on average 34 students committed suicide every day due to several reasons such as exam pressure, and relationship issues. So, it is very important to provide support for them in educational institutions. Counselors can help them to cope with the pressures and can help in improving their mental health. If the student suffers from mental health issues such as severe depression, counselors will take steps to get them treated by psychiatrists.
__label__Support	The covid pandemic affected the mental health of many people. As schools and colleges were shut down for a long time, many students felt isolated and that caused an even more negative impact on mental health. As schools and colleges have reopened, students need help to adapt to the new normal.
__label__Support	Some students do not even understand what they are going through, they may not even know how to ask for help. Having a counselor at their educational institution will help them a lot in understanding their issues. Moreover, they will learn how to ask for advice and help.
__label__Position	There should be a better post-Brexit European Alliance
__label__Attack	The EU and its member states have already various partnership or neighborhood programs for Non-EU states.
__label__Position	The EU should be involved in the creation of a media-funding framework
__label__Attack	In other words, EU (taxpayer)-sponsored propaganda.
__label__Position	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__Position	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection
__label__Position	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__Attack	The British voted to leave the EU therefore all British have the same obligations as immigrants from non-EU countries.
__label__Attack	The British people voted for Brexit, so now naturally they have to live with their choice. It turns out you can't actually have your cake and eat it too.
__label__Support	I think this is a good idea, but unfortunately it's framed as a British/brexit issue. However, the wider concept of a common EU visa / migration system is a compelling one. Harmonising the system to a common visa regime offers many advantages.
__label__Attack	British people are not better than anyone else and do not deserve special treatment from the EU. The British people will face the consequences of their decision to leave the EU and it is not the EU's responsibility to make Brexit painless. The benefits of membership cannot be bestowed upon citizens of countries outside the EU/EEA, like the UK.
__label__Support	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.
__label__Position	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme
__label__Support	Variable pay definitely increases the productivity of employees. High-performing individuals feel well-compensated and rewarded for their efforts, while the under-performing ones also feel motivated to improve.
__label__Support	In variable pay schemes, the employees feel content and motivated with their work. They feel that they are an active part of the organization, the organization recognizes them as a part of its growth and values their efforts.
__label__Support	Variable pay helps in retaining valuable employees. This helps in retaining good talent for long periods of time and thereby, less spending on hiring new talents. This provides stability to the organization.
__label__Attack	It has been seen that it is difficult to retain employees in lean times when they are on variable pay schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when business is good, but they do poorly when business is bad. In times of slow business, even top salespeople might have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent living. If the market is slow and commissioned workers can’t earn enough, they may look for other employment opportunities. In lean times, fixed wages can be more effective at keeping employees from leaving for other opportunities.
__label__Attack	Variable pay can lead to unhealthy competition between employees. They become less willing to help each other. Team co-operation may get affected negatively. In the long run, relations among colleagues may turn bitter. Whereas, in fixed pay schemes, the employees are able to maintain cordial relationships in the office.
__label__Attack	Mostly, sales jobs have a variable component. This might negatively impact the employee’s attitude towards customers. They may force the customers irrationally just to make profits for themselves. They might overstate the price to the customers just to make more profit. Whereas, an employee with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relations with the customers, striking the right balance in their approach.

__label__Attack	factory farming is a cost effective method of food production which allows everyone to access expensive foods at a better price
__label__Attack	we cannot ban things just because you don't like them. factory farms help get the most food per acre.
__label__Attack	factory farming provides a faster mass production of food and gives us a way to feed more people than we would if we banned it. there will be less hunger in the world so we shouldn't ban it.
__label__Support	we should ban factory farming as it poses a huge health risk by passing on diseases and bacteria to people.

__label__Support	factory farming should be banned because it increases the risk of animal cruelty
__label__Attack	factory farming is needed in our times in order to provide ample food for everyone
__label__Attack	we should not ban factory farming because it gives us another source of food.
__label__Support	this is a horrible way to treat animals. they should not be caged in tiny areas, unable to move. this is cruel.

__label__Position	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__Position	We should ban NFTs
__label__Position	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__Support	Yes, and it should be payed out to every citizen of the EU. Those people with a lower CO2 footprint - typically lower income family - would greatly benefit from it and be incentivized to invest in cleaner energy, heating etc.
__label__Support	Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.
__label__Support	Most experts agree that an EU-wide carbon tax would be an efficient way to curb our CO2 emissions.
__label__Support	In my point of view it will be essential to impose some compensatory levies on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage.
__label__Support	Eventually, the best solution would be a world wide agreement (as within OECD and like minded) such as the global minimum tax rate.
__label__Position	United in diversity should be a concept for reconciliation in the Western Balkans.
__label__Support	I believe the EU should expedite the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans, to help them evolve and facilitate the reconciliation problems. As you say, Montenegro for instance is a peaceful country that has made efforts to overcome past troubles, and that too should be acknowledged.
__label__Attack	If we want to uphold to our standards and what the EU represents, we shall help those immigrants and give them the tools to help us make our homes better and multicultural so when the chance is presented they can then have a way to help their countries. Simply blocking them out of our region and neglecting them won't solve anything. We will only make unnecessary enemies.

__label__Attack	autonomous cars could help people make better use of their time
__label__Support	The development of autonomous cars should be halted until we have dealt with the moral question of who would be liable in the case of an accident, hacking or malfunction.
__label__Attack	autonomous cars can give many people the freedom to drive without actually driving, so we should not stop making them.
__label__Attack	development of autonomous car will make traffic and parking easier
__label__Support	autonomous cars have already caused multiple fatalities and are being used on public roads right now without being adequately tested. the makers are literally using human lives to beta test their products.
__label__Attack	autonomous cars could prevent traffic jams and accidents.
__label__Attack	developing autonomous cars is a necessity. it would make roads and travel much safer as car accidents account for an incredible amount of deaths. there would be no more drunk and distracted driving accidents.
__label__Attack	autonomous cars will provide a way for people who are blind or handicapped a way to travel
__label__Attack	autonomous cars are our future and provide many benefits
__label__Attack	autonomous cars can assist the disabled, or those with limited abilities to get about
__label__Support	autonomous cars are a danger to everyone on the roads they can not react the way a human driver can.
__label__Support	autonomous cars strip drivers of the ability to drive as they please
__label__Attack	autonomous cars are so valuable for the future in an ever more congested world so we need to invest more in them.
__label__Attack	autonomous cars allow those with disabilities that hinder driving to be able to travel to appointments, shopping and social events, and not to live isolated from others.
__label__Attack	autonomous cars would help the elderly.
__label__Support	Autonomous cars have caused deadly accidents and they will never be safe enough for widespread public use.
__label__Support	we should stop the development of autonomous cars because they are too dangerous and unreliable until further safety measures and advancements have been made.
__label__Support	the cars can be dangerous and cause accidents if the equipment fails.
__label__Attack	people that can not drive will be able to go wherever they want.
__label__Attack	autonomous cars are the future and some cities already have them.
__label__Attack	we should not because it will cause much less accidents on the road.
__label__Attack	Autonomous car development should be continued to help find safe, renewable energy sourced transportation for the masses.
__label__Attack	they are environmentally friendly and can help minimize traffic congestion.
__label__Attack	autonomous cars can have benefits such as allowing anyone to travel inside a car such as disabled and vulnerable people who others would not be able to get to other places.
__label__Support	autonomous cars will never become reality. we need to stop wasting money on this and instead work towards better safety and technology in regular cars.
__label__Support	autonomous cars can be dangerous and promote reckless behavior, so they should discontinue making them.
__label__Support	it is a waste of resources. we should develop more environmental friendly cars instead.
__label__Support	we should stop the development of autonomous cars because autonomous cars are bad idea, very dangerous
__label__Support	they will lead to more deaths on the roads
__label__Support	autonomous cars are a step too far in automation. to rely on automation on the roads with so many unpredictable events that could take place is taking it too far.
__label__Attack	autonomous cars are simply the next logical step in transportation. years ago people would have said all cars are dangerous and we should all stick to horse and buggy instead.
__label__Support	autonomous cars lack moral judgement.
__label__Support	autonomous cars could increase accidents
__label__Support	autonomous cars are dangerous because they are operated by a computer which can malfunction or be hacked.
__label__Support	taxis are already available for people that want to be driven so autonomous cars aren't necessary.

__label__Support	autonomous cars are not road worthy will cause more accidents due to the cars programing unable to anticipate human decisions
__label__Support	these cars are too unpredictable and unsafe
__label__Attack	globally, over 1 million people die a year in car crashes. to be able to have self driving safe cars that save that many lives a year would be outstanding. robots and self driving cars are the future.
__label__Support	autonomous cars rely on computer software, so like any computer controlled device, they are susceptible to being hacked
__label__Support	autonomous cars are computerized and are open to hacking. at that point they can become a dangerous weapon to not only the driver but everyone around him.
__label__Support	people need the freedom to drive where they want by themselves.
__label__Support	autonomous cars can make driving more dangerous since their programming can not cover every conceivable instance.
__label__Attack	autonomous cars will bring mobility to the disabled.
__label__Support	autonomous cars will never work and the development of said cars should be stopped. there are too many complex situations that will cause more crashes than what is currently happening.

__label__Support	The EU has, for too long, seen a net exodus or brain drain of highly qualified people.
__label__Support	Compared to most anglophone countries, Europe has been quite timid in attracting talent across the globe. Too few people know of and make use of the EU Blue Card. The EU is a destination of choice for migration and refugees from developing and some neighboring countries.

__label__Position	NEET exam should be banned
__label__Attack	NEET exam standardizes the entrance criterion for medical education across the country. As a high score is required to get into government medical colleges, the exam ensures meritocracy.
__label__Attack	But every year, less than 20% of the students are passing the exam. By this, it is evident that the quality of medical education in other countries where Indian students are studying is not at par with the medical education in India. So, it is very important to take steps to provide affordable and high-quality medical education in India.
__label__Support	As the exam requires additional study, coaching centers are taking advantage of the situation and are charging lakhs of rupees for the coaching for the NEET exam. So, due to this, students who cannot afford the coaching are at a disadvantage.
__label__Support	Students work hard to score well in class 12 exams, but all that hard work is not recognized. And only the NEET score is considered for entry into medical college, which is very unfair. Moreover, the NEET exam is mainly based on the CBSE curriculum. So, state board students have to study additional things to get a good score on the exam.
__label__Support	A high score in the NEET exam is required to get admission to government medical colleges in India. It costs approximately Rs.1.25 crores to study in private medical colleges in India. So, many students are forced to go to other countries such as China, Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, etc. to pursue medical education. In those countries, medical education costs around Rs.35 lakhs. Moreover, they allow students with low NEET scores, but above cut-off marks.

__label__Position	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.
__label__Support	The standardized retirement age would not only be fairer in an open market, but it would also (and even more so in the future) prevent any complexities with being paid their retirement for those who have made their contributions in different Member States throughout their lives. Even though there is to be at least a central system for this (a step in the right direction), one will only receive a share of one's retirement from a particular Member State once one reaches the retirement age of that Member State.
__label__Attack	Retirement is often funded by taxes and taxes are decided by each member state. So each member state should also be the one who decides how those taxes are spent. For some countries, a retirement age of 65 may be unaffordable or undesirable, while for others it may not.

__label__Position	European citizens want quality of life and are not interested in world supremacy
__label__Attack	I have never heard anyone talking in Europe about world supremacy. So it seems kind of pointless that this is a goal of EU policy.
__label__Attack	Ensure equal opportunities for girls and women, provide them sufficient maternity leave, and institute guarantees that will protect women's careers who choose to have children. Those are the steps we need, and most EU countries already have them (not that they cannot be improved). There's absolutely no need for quotas.
__label__Attack	All wrong. Let everyone decide for himself (or herself). Forcing women into specific positions is bad ... and sexist I guess.
__label__Attack	Quotas are always disgusting examples of oppression and evil. I don't want anything of that, I want freedom and free choice.
__label__Attack	If you want something like 'increasing the percentage of women in all sectors', you need to create more women or reduce the number of men. I will better not ask questions in this direction.
__label__Attack	Every harpy screams 'more (black) women in power' until Candace Owens appears. Clever, charming black woman, but she is too clever, pro-freedom, and conservative, and that is the problem. So it isn't about women, it's mere greed and desire for power and influence.

__label__Support	sustainable and animal-friendly farms grow their own feed and create an ecological cycle.
__label__Support	The current subsidies with a modular system of incentives should be replaced, as that empowers farmers to choose environmentally, socially, and financially responsible and sustainable solutions that are already available - like natural sequence farming, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, etc.
__label__Support	In Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal feed. In determining how much subsidy a holding receives, the area of the holding is decisive. In other words, a lot of land, a large amount of subsidy. This results in cheap animal feed and, ultimately, intensive livestock farming. Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.

__label__Attack	The European Parliament has developed avenues for a common foreign and defense policy and should exercise its role this way. Also, there are prerogatives of a parliament to guide and control the external policies of the EU.
__label__Position	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Position	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.
__label__Position	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	I am all for the creation of a European army, but for that, the question of the command of this army must also be resolved. And this is where the idea of a European Security Council is very interesting and deserves to be pushed.
__label__Support	I am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction. So NGOs and development cooperation must be involved. An army that can fight must also be able to build. We therefore also need a civilian army in Europe. I would also like an army consisting of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army. Please also take into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objection, also as in the German army.
__label__Support	Absolutely right. Europe needs an army for continental defense. Conscription must be introduced at the European level. The army must have the most modern weapons to deter Russia, Turkey, and China.
__label__Support	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.
__label__Support	I agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.
__label__Support	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.
__label__Support	On the one hand, we have Russia killing countless Ukrainians and committing sabotage in Britain and the Czech Republic, and on the other hand, we have reluctant United States that is switching between isolationist and interventionist policies every 4-8 years. I stand convinced, that in order for the European Union to move forward, it must begin to introduce measures for the security of both, the current member states as well as the future member states that are endangered due to foreign aggression and bring the responsibility of continental safety firmly in our own hands. If Europe is to find the peace it must have the means to create peace by being able to protect itself against hostile foreign influences.
__label__Support	The EU cannot endlessly lean on America or NATO. America has proven to be fickle and NATO has its own problems, such as Turkey, which is outside the EU and has threatened Greece. The EU needs its own independent solution.

__label__Attack	executives who run huge profitable companies that employ many people should be highly compensated for doing so

In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick. Instead, they have willfully created panic. Just like your ad would.

__label__Support	We are increasingly witnessing malicious journalism, corrupted by feelings and disinformation. The purpose of the press services must, as soon as possible, be to bring the news back to the public in the most detailed and detailed manner possible, without inciting malicious and incorrect drawing of attention.
__label__Attack	The EU deciding who is a journalist amounts to the EU deciding what is true.
__label__Position	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__Position	Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond
__label__Support	The range of primary care services should be available to all patients universally, with special emphasis on those at the margins, often in most need.
__label__Attack	Mass migration is an evil that hurts the nations as well as the migrants themselves, who suffer indignities and risk their lives. We must end mass migration. This requires that migrants be helped as close to the origin of migration as possible.
__label__Position	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Support	The undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.
__label__Support	Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.
__label__Attack	Directly electing the president of the commission makes the most susceptible to political sway, which would kill the commission as a body of technical experts.
__label__Attack	How would the candidates be selected? One per country? That just makes it a tight race between the two countries with the largest population (assuming one vote per person). Why would e.g. a Greek person vote for a Swedish candidate? How would even a Swedish candidate campaign in such a way as to appeal to Greek voters?
__label__Attack	In Germany, the President of the Executive is not elected by the people directly either. The reason for this is the horrible experience during the Third Reich. The Parliament - as the only constitutional institution being directly elected - has a stronger stand if the President is not elected directly. However I definitely support, that the Parliament becomes stronger and more influential.
__label__Attack	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.
__label__Attack	The European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else. An elected head of the Commission would make nonsense of the principle of independence that is vital to the trust in the Commission's job. He or she would be beholden to the group that elected him or her and make the job impossible.
__label__Support	European political parties should be independent of national parties. There should be primaries open for the citizens to choose the candidate, it would increase citizen participation and involvement in EU politics.
__label__Position	We should stop integration.
__label__Attack	All refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left.
__label__Attack	All refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left.
__label__Position	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__Support	The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.
__label__Support	Public services of good quality and universal access are key to ensuring fairer, more inclusive, and equal societies. They have a clear redistributive effect and help steer development in a more sustainable direction. The Covid-19 crisis if anything helped to prove the crucial role that the public sector and public services play and must continue playing!
__label__Position	There should be a president for the EU elected by the people.
__label__Support	We need one single president of the Commission that will chair the Commission and the Council. I wonder though how the president of the EU Parliament would be involved in this structure.
__label__Support	We should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.
__label__Support	The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 Frenchman would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own above people whose countries the Americans have bombed to shreds.
__label__Support	It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.
__label__Support	Our Europe continent is in debt and doesn't have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to disregard our laws! We have enough poor people in Europe already and we need to take care of them!
__label__Attack	What are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money? The religion? The food? Their political system? And then reevaluate each year? This comment is plain ignorant.

__label__Position	Donald Trump's Presidency was a good thing
__label__Attack	Trump has been prioritizing some noticeable issues like the Muslim immigration clampdown, challenging the independence of the Fed, bizarre and ill-qualified cabinet selections, antagonizing China and other trading partners for no reason or embracing Russia and its rogue regime. This is not acceptable beyond limits and can turn people and communities against him.
__label__Attack	Racism &amp; white supremacy has increased in Trump's term.
__label__Position	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Position	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Attack	At present, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure the security of data. On the other hand, developed countries already have an efficient infrastructure. So, rushing toward data localization may not be a wise step. Because without efficient infrastructure, the data is prone to cyber-attacks. And the risk is severe here because it is financial data. But as the laws are made, it is a big challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.
__label__Attack	Storing data in India means higher operational costs for payment system operators. Because in other countries they have cheaper alternatives. And also for cross-border transactions, they have to store the data in two places, which increases costs. There is a probability that these extra costs may pass on to the consumers.
__label__Support	Data localization laws result in the setting up of multiple data centers locally. This will create many jobs and will help the country’s economy immensely. It will also drive innovation in the field resulting in low-cost solutions.
__label__Support	While investigating crimes, there will be a need to access the payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to take permission from that country for access to the data. This causes delays in solving crimes. If the data is stored here within our country, this problem will be avoided.
__label__Support	India is a big consumer market for many foreign companies. So, India and other developing countries are realizing the economic value of the data and the importance of data localization. With data localization, domestic companies and the country’s economy will be benefited. And we can also ensure the security of the data.
__label__Support	Data is considered a ‘new form of wealth’. Generally, companies use data to understand the requirements of consumers and also to influence their behavior. New products can be developed by analyzing the data to meet the needs of consumers. So the data has an economic value. In general, developed countries are utilizing this opportunity with their well-developed infrastructure.
__label__Attack	We are in a globalized world. At present, the world is running on the free flow of people, goods, services, and data. Data localization laws seem to be a part of protectionist policies, which is a threat to the free flow of data.
__label__Attack	The US is against data localization laws. Recently at the G20 summit, Donald Trump, the president of the US spoke against data localization. Its stance is natural because it increases the operational costs of US companies. India-US bilateral relations are important for both countries because we are intertwined in the export and import of IT services, professionals and goods, etc. So, imposing data localization laws without threatening Indo-US relations is another challenge.
__label__Support	We can ensure data privacy by localizing the data.
__label__Attack	Data localization may result in government surveillance of its citizens.
__label__Support	Data localization is important for data sovereignty, which means the data of the citizens should be owned by the respective governments and not by other countries.
__label__Position	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Attack	Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd world countries. This includes fighting for climate justice and decreasing unequal wealth distribution between countries.
__label__Support	Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden's Stockholm has become the Rape Capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has skyrocketed as well in that country. France is bordering on civil war, whole territories are not under state control anymore. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We need to put our European peoples first, much like the entire world is doing while our civilization is committing suicide based on values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists.
__label__Support	There's nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and putting your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as self-evident. We need to negotiate Remigration deals with the 3rd countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push back any migrants coming to our borders.
__label__Support	We are Europeans; this is not racism but we don't support growth. If we accept many immigrants then we make a huge stop in the growth of the migrant countries, because I am 100% sure that they will never ever go back to their country.
__label__Attack	I have no trouble with, non-western, immigrants. I have trouble with 'mass immigration'. What happens is when they come in large numbers they do not integrate anymore. They stick to themselves and become a new tribe that tries to change their host country.'
__label__Support	Europe should look at the European people first. It is not fair for the working classes to have to live within the ruins of multiculturalism while the middle class supports immigration from within their gated communities.
__label__Support	Immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration.

__label__Position	Climate neutrality can be achieved only by nuclear energy
__label__Support	if we want stable, reliable energy grid we need a nuclear energy source. Solar energy and wind are not reliable, need a lot of batteries, and can not be a sole solution for the energy grid.
__label__Support	We need to ensure fair redistribution of refugees across Europe and ensure better integration of refugees and applicants for international protection into the workplace. More concrete and fairer European policy on economic migration, to establish legal channels for entry and to foster an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as a key tool to address the social impact of migration flows.
__label__Position	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
__label__Position	There should be an EU citizenship
__label__Attack	If we do have an EU citizenship we will have an EU country and EU already proved to be no good dealing with problems and is extremely undemocratic and not listening to the people.
__label__Support	Bad governance, unreasonable spending, and corruption are damaging and unsustainable which means, we can't afford to leave them alone if we want to have a future.
__label__Support	The EU needs to focus on simplifying and standardizing European processes and procedures associated with public management and creating efficient and effective anti-corruption mechanisms. This will reduce the financial resources to be made available to the most relevant areas of intervention at the EU, country, and regional Levels.
__label__Support	The law is very clear that RTI is not just concerned with government bodies alone. It is also for Non-Government Organisations which are substantially financed and controlled by the Government. There are numerous subsidies (including Tax exemptions) that the Political parties enjoy, thereby, they are substantially financed by the Government.
__label__Attack	Political parties are independent bodies, they need not be accountable to the public. They were not established by the constitution or an act of parliament.
__label__Support	The RTI Act states that wherever there is Public Interest, those organizations need to be transparent and come under the ambit of the law. There are numbers of Private organizations today, whether partially funded or fully; schools, hospitals, etc. that are under the RTI Act and not just Government organizations.
__label__Attack	There are adequate provisions in the Income Tax law and with the Election Commission so that people can have whatever information they want.
__label__Support	The RTI Act has provisions under section 8 which mention the concept of Competitive Interest. Certain exemptions are provided in cases where it can be proved that divulging information can hurt the Competitive Advantage of the party. This is not just a problem with Political Parties but a lot of Government and Private bodies too.
__label__Support	Political funding is believed to be the fountainhead of corruption. The citizens have the right to know where the political parties are raising these funds from, how they spend these funds, and the basis of their decisions. Crony capitalism will be hugely curbed if political parties are brought under RTI Act.
__label__Support	Under the IT Act, political parties do not need to disclose donations that they get below INR 20,000. An informal study done in 2010 on 6 key political parties shows that they raised Rs 700 crore. 95% of the amount was raised by amounts below Rs 20,000. There is a high possibility that the political parties use this loophole to their advantage.
__label__Support	Political parties declare certain promises in their manifestos. After getting elected, the citizens have a right to know why the promises made by the political parties were not fulfilled.
__label__Support	Political parties are central to the functioning of Democracy. Political Parties go on to form the government. The government policies are then governed by the party’s ideology. Thereby, it becomes essential for political parties to come under the ambit of RTI.
__label__Attack	If political parties come under the RTI, it will affect their smooth internal functioning. Rivals may use RTI to malign each other. Also, since the political parties are not connected to the public directly, an RTI would be invalid.
__label__Position	We should adopt a multi-party system
__label__Support	it would give people more of a choice and provides someone for every culture to vote for
__label__Support	We should adopt a multi-party system as the current two party system does not fit the diverse society that it is supposed to represent.
__label__Attack	the two-party system is cheaper and easier to operate that any multi-party system
__label__Support	multi-party systems offer voters more choices and more representation.
__label__Attack	adopting a multi-party system leads to the formation weak and unstable coalition governments
__label__Support	In multi-party systems, there are many types of ideologies - as opposed to two-party systems, where the nation is not divided into two rival groups.
__label__Attack	multi-party systems slow down what gets done because we have too many different sides trying to come to an agreement
__label__Support	a multi-party system allows for more options and candidates that are more in line with certain populations as not everyone has the same political views.
__label__Attack	amulti-party system can lead to unstable coalitions in order to get into power
__label__Attack	too many choices in political parties separates people in a country instead of helping them to unite.
__label__Support	A multi-party system allows for greater choice in whom to vote for. It allows each citizen to vote for the party that best fits their beliefs and represents their ideology.
__label__Attack	a multiparty system blurs the citizenship of a vision and model of country. we should not adopt a multiparty system because it would waste valuable time to agree
__label__Support	tywo party systems no longer reflect the growing diversity of political views, only a multi party system can do this.
__label__Attack	it makes a mockery of voting for your political party of choice if the end result is a multi-party system which will lead to people not voting if they feel they do not have a say.
__label__Support	A multi-party system would bring in a lot more choice of representation for the people living in the country.
__label__Attack	introducing a multi-party system would be detrimental to stability and consistency of our political system
__label__Support	we must have more options to choose and leave this bipartisan dictatorship
__label__Support	multi-party systems help decentralize power and better represent the various interests of different socio-economic strata within a nation.
__label__Attack	multiple parties make choosing a leader harder
__label__Support	multi-party systems provide many new sources of views on relevant topics
__label__Support	a multi-party system will help to ensure that more political agendas will be given the chance to represent the people
__label__Attack	a two-party system has served us well for years; why change what has worked?
__label__Support	the multi-party system works and ensures that everybody has their say
__label__Attack	a multi-party system leads to too much division and there may never be an overall consensus
__label__Support	a multi-party ensures that all people and voices are heard and represented.
__label__Attack	a multi-party system will lack real leadership and will mean that policies often end up being diluted or not passed at all as a majority can not be reached.
__label__Attack	multiple parties will just confuse people and cause more divisiveness in society
__label__Attack	a multi-party system weakens speed of decision making and ensures no progress is made so we should not adopt it.
__label__Attack	a multi-party system would be too confusing
__label__Support	In a multi-party system, minority needs are better catered to.
__label__Attack	a multi party system is too volatile, there's no stability and no consistency
__label__Attack	too much parties are dangerous for cohesion.
__label__Support	in a multi party system the general population have more of a choice in who their leaders are
__label__Attack	a multi party system will lead to the rise of fringe groups that do not represent the will of the people.
__label__Attack	we should no adopt a multi-party system because nothing would ever get done with varying points of view.
__label__Support	the interests of a two party system are very limited and we need to expand with more parties to cater to more views
__label__Support	multi-party systems bring diversity to politics, and giving more voices to the population
__label__Attack	multi-party systems encourage the formation of weak and unstable coalitions that achieve little beyond their own day to day survival
__label__Attack	a multi-party system spreads votes out to thin,so as one leader can be victorious even though they did not receive the majority of the peoples' votes.
__label__Support	could open up congress and create new opportunities for bargaining and coalition building on unusual lines.
__label__Attack	if it ain't broke, don't fix it. it is working and has for a long time.
__label__Support	A multi-party system prevents the leadership of a single party from setting policy without challenge.
__label__Support	a multi-party system allows a greater freedom of choice for voters to express their democratic right to vote for policies they would like to implimented.
__label__Attack	currently 2 parties can't agree enough to accomplish anything, it would only get worse to get multiple parties to all agree on anything.
__label__Attack	consensus can become difficult in multi party systems
__label__Attack	this would result in inaccurate representation in government. if there where numerous parties, votes would be split all over and the party people least wanted would win resulting in inaccurate representation.
__label__Attack	a multi-party system makes it much more difficult to collaborate on ideas.
__label__Attack	they can lead to too much indecision
__label__Support	a poll shows that more than 90% of the people are in support of a multi-party system in the usa.
__label__Support	this would possibly eliminate the war between democrats and republicans.
__label__Attack	more parties will create a more convoluted political system
__label__Attack	multi-party systems lead to more corruption and wasted campaign dollars.
__label__Support	a multi-party system allows for the airing of more viewpoints and would require politicians to build coalitions and compromise in order to get things accomplished.
__label__Attack	a multi-party system could add more complexity and create situations where issues become impossible to resolve.
__label__Support	a key advantage of a multi-party system is that voters have a choice of which political party they can choose to elect.
__label__Support	more political parties give people more of a choice to support what they believe in.
__label__Support	the multi-party system offers voters more choices that may get more people involved in politics
__label__Support	a multi-party system would help create more options for voters.
__label__Support	a multi-party system allows for more unqualified people to get into the race
__label__Support	a multi-party system is the fairest representation of all political viewpoints, and would increase the electorate's engagement with politics in general.
__label__Support	the current system is broken and doesn't work. neither side can work together so having more options would force politicians to come together and do what's best for the people because no side would be majority
__label__Attack	a multi-party system could lead to more situations where a majority is not reached. this means that it could be harder to push policies through.
__label__Support	the two-party system is outdated and has proven, lately, that it does not always result in the best possible candidates.
__label__Support	we should adopt a multi-party system because it makes it so that there is naturally more of a choice
__label__Support	this would provide more choices and let us see more points of view
__label__Attack	a multi party system creates chaos by giving too many choices to the people
__label__Support	a multi party system would bring many new & fresh ideas into the forefront
__label__Attack	a multiparty system would be too decentralized
__label__Attack	a multi-party system offers too many options and decreases the election voting for one candidate, spreading out the votes over too many options.
__label__Attack	Multiple-party systems often have candidates with radical views whereas two-party systems tend to be more moderate.
__label__Attack	Minority parties have too much power. A winning party often has to offer concessions to small, minority parties in order to form a government.
__label__Support	a multi-party system allows for a broad range of ideas to be heard and implemented.
__label__Support	multi-party systems are proven around the world to work better
__label__Attack	multi-party systems fragments power so much that nothing ever gets done and government is rendered ineffectual.
__label__Support	a multi-party system allows for more ideas, more candidates, more voters turning out.
__label__Support	a multi-party is essential to allow for democracy and prevent autocratic regimes coming to power.
__label__Support	we need better representation of all people. the two party system is broken and only represents a select few.
__label__Attack	In a multi-party system, parties are more easily manipulated by the political agendas of different groups.
__label__Support	there are too many diverse political philosophies to be crammed into 2 parties
__label__Attack	It is less likely for two party systems to have cooperation or coalitions based on extremist ideology.
__label__Support	a multi-party system would bring more choices for people to speak up and vote.
__label__Support	we absolutely need a multi party system. the two party system is a failure. the entire country can't be split in to only two categories. we need better representation of the people.
__label__Support	we should adopt a multi-party system because we need more than one opinion to round out solutions.
__label__Support	by having a multi-party system people would be able to support parties with their values and the a larger party may adopt polices from the smaller one for support
__label__Attack	The winner can be someone voted in to office by a very small percentage of voters.
__label__Attack	multi-party systems should not be allowed as it only causes a no win-win situation when the other parties can not agree upon a situation.
__label__Attack	it can become confusing when voting on a multi-party system
__label__Support	it would allow more voices to be heard and more choice.
__label__Support	a multi party system allows far better choices for the diverse population, meaning they can find someone to vote for that they truly believe in and participate in a democracy better
__label__Support	it will give a stronger representation of the electorate.
__label__Support	as many people's views don't fall in line with the two large parties, we can't say the current system is truly representative.
__label__Position	We need an integrated migration and border policy.
__label__Support	The EU member states need to lift together instead of trying to push the burdens onto each other or external nations.
__label__Support	The EU member states need to lift together instead of trying to push the burdens onto each other or external nations.
__label__Position	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__Position	Serbia should join the EU.
__label__Support	The EU should continue its enlargement to the Western Balkans to further its own interests, and to bring stability and prosperity to the region. Serbia should have joined long ago.
__label__Position	The EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states
__label__Support	Hungary’s and Poland’s governments have ruthlessly corrupted their judgments to get a free card on abstract EU funds. Enough! If even Romania can be carried out to join the enhanced cooperation, those last two must be forced.
__label__Support	The EU must take a strong position against corruption and be in favor of an independent, supranational proscecutor that is the EPPO.
__label__Attack	Absolutely unacceptable because it would lead to the politicization of the justice system.
__label__Attack	It is unacceptable. Every nation has the right to organize its own prosecution system and no foreign prosecutor should be allowed to operate in independent states, it is a threat to the sovereignty of the member states.
__label__Position	The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world
__label__Attack	Democracy and civilization are the essences of Europe and the EU must uphold those values. For me, the word civilization is also to be civil, which in some way is the opposite of being militarized. The EU should not be a superpower. Nuclear detergence should be enough.
__label__Attack	There is enough environmental task to handle and Europe have had its wars. But to streamline our powers and therefore try to save huge amounts of money is a no-brainer.
__label__Position	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__Position	We should legalize organ trade
__label__Support	We should legalize the organ trade because currently people are punished for obeying the law and not purchasing organs, in the form of longer wait times.
__label__Support	we need more organs than people donate so legalizing it would be a good thing
__label__Support	if we legalize the organ trade we will save lives, by ensuring that more people who need an organ transplant actually get one.
__label__Support	Organ sales increase the likelihood that people with rare blood types or conditions can find an organ.
__label__Attack	we should not legalize organ trade because then people would be selling their organs just for money
__label__Support	legalizing organ trade would being about more healthy organs and tissue for transplanting then currently is available.
__label__Support	people should be allowed to get organs from other countries by buying them if the wait list for their transplant is too long and they are at risk of dying.
__label__Attack	Selling organs is dangerous, leading to many deaths on the operating table.
__label__Support	we should legalize organ trade because many people who are in need of organs have trouble getting good organs.
__label__Attack	we would end up in bidding wars where only the rich could be helped
__label__Support	legal organ trade would help prevent wait lists
__label__Attack	legalizing the organ trade would lead to people forcing or coercing other into giving their organs. this would increase death and suffering.
__label__Support	organ trade between consenting parties should be an option as it can reduce wait times.
__label__Support	people are more likely to share their organs if there is financial benefit to them, increasing supply.
__label__Support	organs are expensive, and a legal trade can allow for someone in desperate need to get an organ without money or wait times.
__label__Attack	people would sell organs because to them money is more important than health, putting them at risk.
__label__Support	Legalizing the organ trade would allow more patients to receive the organ transplant they need.
__label__Support	everyone should have a choice about what they want to do with their bodies, and if selling an organ is one of them, they should be free to decide.
__label__Support	people should be able to do what they want with their bodies.
__label__Support	legalising organ trade would put an end to the black market trading.
__label__Attack	organ trade must remain illegal. there is far too much potential for corruption and human trafficking/murder if organs can be sold.
__label__Attack	the sale of organs may lead to a black market of such, where people may give birth and raise children just for their organs.
__label__Support	there is never going to be enough voluntary donation to meet demand, opening up an organ trade could remedy this drastic gap in supply to help save lives
__label__Support	a human being at death can help others to live and through organ trade help their families live
__label__Attack	we shouldn't legalize organ trade because is horror for familiys
__label__Support	Organs, as part of our bodies, are our property and should not be regulated by the government; we should be free to sell them on an open market.
__label__Support	organ trade would allow for more people to get transplants because there would be more availability.
__label__Attack	legalizing organ trade could result in more criminal murders which is not acceptable.

__label__Attack	we need the three strikes as a deterrent
__label__Attack	if someone hasn't learned by the first two chances then they aren't going to stop committing crimes. it makes more sense to lock them away than to let them keep committing crimes against the population.

__label__Support	the three-strikes law is unfair to those criminals who are trying to reform themselves.

__label__Attack	three-strikes laws makes criminals less likely to reoffend.
__label__Attack	the three strikes law teaches criminals you will no longer be able to keep committing crimes and getting away with it.
__label__Attack	three-strike laws give a clear message to offenders who may be in danger of re-offending, that doing so would be met with more severity than their first offense. that way it works as a clear deterent.
__label__Support	three strikes is too many in some cases. if people know they have three chances, they will not be deterred from using that to their advantage.
__label__Support	Three strikes laws are expensive because they increase how long people are incarcerated which must be paid for by tax payers.
__label__Support	Three strikes laws lead to more people being put in jail which ends up being a burden on tax-payers and federal funding.
__label__Support	there are individuals that have received strikes against them for minor crimes or things done as teens. there is no magic number in three. sentences should depend on the type and severity of crimes.

__label__Support	three strikes laws lack nuance and fail to evaluate circumstances around crimes committed.

__label__Support	the three-strikes law is unfair to those whose crimes are minimal verses those whose crimes are very bad.
__label__Attack	repeat offenders need to be punished severely.
__label__Support	We should abolish the three-strikes laws because they introduce arbitrary punishment for some crimes over others, when the action was the same.

__label__Support	they laws don't stop crime, they just punish people harder.
__label__Support	criminals should have a chance to go straight, even if they've committed the same crime multiple times.
__label__Attack	the three-strikes law is good at keeping criminals off of the streets
__label__Support	if there are 3 minor offenses there is no need to overly punish someone.
__label__Support	As people age they tend to commit less crimes, keeping individuals in jail for life only because of three-strikes laws is a waste of money and doesn't protect society.
__label__Attack	We should not abolish the three-strikes laws because they are popular with voters and it would be undemocratic to remove them.
__label__Attack	the three-strikes law shouldn't be abolished because by having the law it keeps repeat offenders in prisons and gets them off of the streets.
__label__Support	we should abolish the three-strikes laws because they can put people away for minor crimes
__label__Attack	if people are habitually re-offending then they need a punishment that will stop them. a mandatory prison sentence is the minimum they should have as a punishment.
__label__Attack	Three strike laws take habitual offenders off the street, reducing overall crime.
__label__Attack	three-strike offenders are habitual criminals and should be treated as such
__label__Attack	if a person has been arrested for three crimes they have not learned from their mistakes but see being a criminal as a lifestyle. let's put those people behind bars and prevent more crimes.
__label__Support	we should abolish the three strikes laws because the punishment is just enough for their convictions and no need to add more another years.
__label__Support	The three-strikes law makes judicial discretion - one of the hallmarks of our justice system - superfluous.
__label__Support	criminals shouldn't get extra chances when committing crimes anyway, so the three-strikes law is not necessary.

__label__Attack	three-strikes laws can act as a deterrent for serial criminal behavior.
__label__Attack	three strikes allows someone to make a genuine mistake and not be punished as harshly right away.
__label__Support	we should abolish the three-strikes law because the definition of a previous violent offense could be arbitrary and prisons need to be places for rehabilitation, not excessive punishment.
__label__Support	Three-strike laws lead to expensive trials. Three-strike offenders will demand a court trial rather than accept a plea bargain (which costs a fraction of the price of a full-blown trial).
__label__Support	it causes people to receive disproportionately high sentences for petty crimes
__label__Attack	We should not abolish the three-strikes laws in all cases, but it should be up to judicial discretion, so that the worst criminal are off the streets.
__label__Support	three-strikes laws are a major reason for overcrowding in our prison system.
__label__Attack	if we got rid of three-strikes laws, there would be little deterrent for career criminals.
__label__Attack	if people do not learn from their mistakes and corrections then they are unfit to live among society.
__label__Support	three-strike laws should be abolished as it negatively impact minorities and people of color who are more likely to commit crime due to poverty issues.
__label__Support	we should abolish the three-strikes laws because i don't think people should be given more than one chance, they are grown adults and know right from wrong
__label__Support	the three strikes law is an old concept. it doesn't really prevent people from committing violence, especially because many acts of violence are not premeditated.
__label__Support	Three strikes laws are difficult to understand or conceptualize, so they are ineffective at preventing crime.
__label__Support	the three-strikes laws prevent rehabilitation for those who have committed minor offensives such as substance abuse treatment that can prevent future criminal acts.
__label__Attack	we shouldn't abolish the three-strikes law because it does give criminals a fair warning which is two chances of bad behavior and then if you do it again, you're no longer in society. violent crime is reduced
__label__Attack	Three strikes laws are perfectly constitutional since the punishment isn't unusual and they are proportional to frequency of crime if not intensity of criminal action.
__label__Attack	we need to take control of criminals and hold them responsible for their actions.
__label__Support	it is unjust and discriminates against minorities
__label__Attack	if someone is habitually offending, they deserve to be punished on the harshest level.
__label__Attack	this law keeps communities safe from career criminals
__label__Attack	not everyone can be reformed. some people are a danger to society, and two failed attempts at reform is far more than they deserve.
__label__Support	this law is unfair to those who's third crime is minor and thought should be given to changing the criteria of the third crime.
__label__Support	three-strikes laws often lead to harsh punishments that do not fit their crimes
__label__Support	the three strikes law punishes people to harshly for minor crimes. they shouldn't have to spend the rest of their lives in prison unless they are crimes that harm another person.
__label__Support	The three-strikes law gives no room for mitigating factors to be considered, making our justice system a rigid one that does not allow for true justice.
__label__Attack	we should not abolish the three-strikes laws but we could improve them so that people who have committed only a minor offence are not jailed for life.
__label__Support	criminals should be given a chance to reform, even if they committed the same crime multiple times.
__label__Support	the three strikes law make it hard for those criminals who are trying to reform.
__label__Attack	the three-strikes law serves as an effective deterrent and should not be abolished.
__label__Support	all crimes are not equal with thee strikes laws murder is the same as jay walking. each crime should include a number of factors and not just an arbitrary number.

__label__Attack	we should not abolish the three-strikes laws because the criminal deserves what they did and justice must be done unto them
__label__Support	many people could pay long sentences for nonviolent crimes
__label__Support	the three-strikes law should be abolished. each convicted crime should be punished individually. it isn't right to judge a person solely on their criminal history.
__label__Support	The three-strikes law should be abolished and the punishment should always fit the crime so if the third crime is petty then they should have a minimal sentence or fine rather than prison terms.
__label__Support	Since prison's radicalize more than they rehabilitate, three strikes laws end up creating more re-offenders by putting people away for longer in an environment that radicalizes them.
__label__Support	I am happy to see that the ide of haling all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is still going strong. This message needs to be communicated to Brussels very clearly.
__label__Support	European citizens are the future of Europe!
__label__Support	Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Regressive outdated ideologies and values should have no place in Europe.
__label__Support	The migrants that are already (legally) here should be taught western values so they and their families can integrate/assimilate, as the age-old saying goes 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'.
__label__Attack	In Conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we are making business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '
__label__Support	Europe must stay Europe and people must not be imposed a cultural and religious change they do not want and which is insane. Look at what the Arabic or north African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islam.
__label__Support	We need to stop all funding to NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. Then can we talk about how to help the people already here and how to help real people in need.
__label__Support	We need to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in centers for repatriation.
__label__Support	Marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists!

__label__Position	Technology is rising Unemployment rates
__label__Support	Several kinds of jobs are increasingly getting replaced by technology. As per the reports, there is a significant drop in the typists, weavers, construction workers etc.
__label__Support	If any business depends heavily on human labour, it tends to fail as it cannot cope up with the competition from the technologically advanced competitors.
__label__Support	Esperanto should be promoted as an international lingua franca. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of cross-cultural communication, allowing high degrees of inclusion.
__label__Position	We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage
__label__Support	Every child is different. Homeschooling allows to design the curriculum based on the student's capabilities and interests.
__label__Support	Children can better explore themselves when they do not have constraints.
__label__Position	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	In order to promote European peace, prosperity, and precious diversity, a different administration system is needed: a federal Europe, based on a democratic federal constitution instead of anarchy-provoking EU treaties.
__label__Support	Catalonia must become independent from the Spanish dictatorial repression that tries to end the Catalan language and culture.
__label__Support	Europe was composed of 13 countries in 1870 and 23 in 1914. Maybe it's time to change borders without bloodshed.
__label__Support	We live in the XXI century. We do not want any repression of peripheries by their state center. Within the European Union, we should welcome the blessing of decentralism and localism, including the self-determination of stateless peoples and stronger autonomies within confederal agreements. If not in Europe, where? If not now, when?
__label__Support	According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR), ‘[a]ll peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The right to self-determination also has its economic content which gives the people the right to freely ‘dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law.'
__label__Support	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.
__label__Support	Self-determination is a basic collective human right. Catalans practiced this right in 2017. Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence. Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start. If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially. This crucial step will enforce European democracy, the Democracy of Citizens that feel free and respected within European borders.
__label__Support	Every nation with its own language and culture, which demands the same status as a sovereign nation within Europe, must have the right to be recognized and respected by people and other member nations/states.
__label__Support	There are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.
__label__Support	The right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.
__label__Support	In a democracy, people have the right to decide on any issue that affects their lives. If more than half of the inhabitants of a region want to form an independent state, they have the right to do so. Going against it is going against the will of the majority of citizens, and therefore, against the very essence of democracy.
__label__Support	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.
__label__Support	France should offer its seat on the UN Security Council, so European interests are represented.
__label__Position	We need to invest in nuclear energy
__label__Attack	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable. According to the researchers at RethinkX, we will see a clean energy disruption in the next ten years which will leave investments in oil, coal and nuclear stranded.
__label__Attack	Promoting, organizing, and directing mass migration is a crime against humanity. Lukashenko is currently committing exactly this heinous crime. But so are George Soros and his NGOs who are engaged in the very same hybrid warfare against Europe when they bring those migrants to our shores.
__label__Attack	Either the EU will be a fortress against illegal migration or it will not exist anymore in the future.
__label__Support	Europe is more than rich enough to welcome many immigrants and if they are permitted to work, they will even generate their own income and benefits for the country they arrive in.
__label__Attack	You are justifying the genocide of indigenous Europeans who, when asked, always reject these 'refugees'.
__label__Support	As EU citizens we should never forget how privileged we are, and that we bear a human obligation to help others in need.
__label__Support	It is necessary that member states better share the efforts of receiving asylum seekers upon arrival at EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to frontline countries. The EU should develop a joint approach to support the frontline countries to assure that asylum seeker are provided adequate care, assistance, and protection upon arrival and are quickly distributed evenly throughout the EU for status determination.
__label__Support	The root causes to leave their home countries should not be overlooked. The EU and its member states need to increase efforts to make the countries of origin more liveable.
__label__Attack	Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the greatest existential threat to the EU. Even more so than the CO2 threat.
__label__Position	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__Attack	This idea is what we have been doing for the last 30 years. It did not produce sufficient results to justify continuing on this path. It is just saying, that problem will solve itself. This proposition is harmful and does not stand on any data that could justify it.
__label__Attack	It is not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognizing patterns, reasons, and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in a vacuum. If it is easier and cheaper to live not sustainably, people will do it, even if they are conscious of the consequences.
__label__Attack	We should arrange our cities, our economy, and politics so that it is easy for people to behave ecologically responsibly. It requires a lot of work now, but it is work that we have to do if we want to transition to something more sustainable.
__label__Position	We should consider Russian interests in the EU policy.
__label__Position	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__Position	We should ban naturopathy
__label__Support	Intensive Care Medicine deserves to be added to the Annex V, as well as all citizens of the EU deserve top standards of critical care and safety when admitted to this demanding environment.
__label__Support	The pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves. We saw patients in very critical condition being moved away from their families from one Member State to another to receive treatment while allowing the doctors to move would be much more efficient and less life-threatening for the patients.

__label__Position	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles
__label__Support	Give those who want to come a fair & secure possibility to do so & send those back who really damage your society. Give training, support, opportunities. My guess is that most will pay back with their contributions.
__label__Support	We already have successful programs for students from refugee camps. Enhance that.
__label__Support	Yes, though some countries have other problems right now. Give member states the possibility to choose: more refugees & more money & support or less refugees & less money & support. Very simple.
__label__Support	We should think of more opportunities to enter the EU legally. Many people come illegally, because we refuse them opportunities to come, stay a while for work or education and maybe go back later. People die because of that nonsense.
__label__Support	I recently read that especially African families tend to send their smartest, best educated youngsters abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their home countries and for our future. We need skilled & educated people in many sectors, but sends such people back to their home countries, because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees.
__label__Position	Frontex should regularly publish transparency reports
__label__Attack	Frontex interfering with the national border guards doing their sacred duty to protect the border, and then sending anonymous reports to criticize these brave men and women is quite abhorrent.
__label__Position	People from radical Muslim countries should be banned from entering the EU countries
__label__Attack	An outright ban on muslim countries is ridiculous, the leadership of these countries and the media depictions of the people of these countries do not reflect the actual people who live there, they are no threat to us
__label__Position	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism
__label__Support	I strongly agree with this proposal that trade and investment policy should be reformed, especially, that greater attention should be paid to environmental aspects. The current situation is unsatisfactory and even dangerous.
__label__Support	Economic interests should never be at the expense of social and environmental policy. It is of utmost importance that the protection of workers’ rights and the rules we agreed upon with the Paris Agreement on climate change are at the heart of trade and investment policy. As the EU belongs to the global market, we must guarantee decent jobs that are sustainable, as well as collective, independent representation of workers in trade unions.
__label__Support	The EU should be able to contribute to a relaunch of global multilateralism, through a profound reform based on democracy and peace, solidarity, and respect for human, social, and environmental rights.
__label__Support	We need an investment policy that creates decent jobs and fosters labor rights and especially Trade Unions around the globe. There can not be a sustainable world without collective representation of workers/employees by free Trade Unions.
__label__Support	Trade should always include the respect and the protection of fundamental and human rights, including workers' and trade union rights.
__label__Support	The protection of fundamental and human rights, decent work, and the high quality of public services for all must be an integral part of trade and investment policy reform.
__label__Support	The present international economic system and trade institutions are too much a product of the not-so-glorious colonial past. We should put more democracy, more rights for people, and more equality into the international economic order.
__label__Support	Sustainable development and climate change mitigation in EU Trade deals should be examples of best practices of EU policy.
__label__Support	The EU needs to both promote and uphold the highest social and environmental standards in its internal as well as external policies. Human rights and collective agreements must never be seen as barriers to trade!
__label__Position	We should decriminalize drug use
__label__Position	Retirement homes should become more common

__label__Support	we should fund journalism to serve the public interest.

__label__Support	supporting journalism is obligatory in our democracy society and `free speech` should be defended and approved by all means.
__label__Attack	State subsidies for journalism will make journals financially dependent on the government, which will allow the government to influence what news gets reported and how the reporting is done.
__label__Support	keeping journalist in work helps the nation keep up with the news
__label__Attack	journalists get paid enough, they don't need any more money.
__label__Support	presentation of information is important and needs help to keep it viable and reliable.
__label__Support	We should subsidize journalism because we need to keep local journalism alive so people are aware of what is going on in their community, but small news papers are struggling the most.
__label__Support	if the government subsidized journalism fake news could be controlled.
__label__Support	it would make all news fair and the same across the board

__label__Attack	journalism can make enough income to support itself as is seen by the countless successful media outlets

__label__Attack	State subsidies for jouranalism aren't supported by a majority of the populace, making it undemocratic and not something the state should do.
__label__Attack	we already are in high enough debt, we don't need to make it worse be subsidizing pointless things.
__label__Support	When newspapers worry more about the bottom line than the headlines, the quality of the papers goes down resulting in poor pop journalism that panders to the public and the advertisers.
__label__Attack	journalism is self sustaining and subsidizing it gives the government control over content.
__label__Support	Subsidizing journalism increases journalist pay, allowing for better journalism.
__label__Support	we need journalists to keep us informed as to what is going on in the world
__label__Support	We should subsidize journalism so that journalists can cover the most important issues, rather than only the most profitable ones.
__label__Support	subsidizing journalism allows more voices to be heard
__label__Support	Without journalism people have no way of having the information that empower them to make informed voting decisions, making journalism central to democracy and therefore in need of subsidization.
__label__Attack	We should not subsidize journalism because it is not uniquely important to democracy compared to a host of other industries.
__label__Support	i believe the government should help pay for journalism because it would allow for better coverage of news events, and help pay the high costs of filming.
__label__Attack	Journalism is a profession and does not need subsidizing as students can pay for themselves to learn and then be recompensed by getting a paid job.
__label__Attack	subsidization would cause biased reporting
__label__Attack	unchecked journalism can lead to biases, paid content, and sow seeds of distrust in the media.
__label__Attack	subsidised journalism leaves us at risk of governmental interference in the news we are allowed to see.

__label__Attack	the is enough money in journalism already, and funds available through subsidies should be redirected towards more worthwhile causes such as healthcare.
__label__Support	journalism is important in this country.
__label__Attack	if journalism is good, then it will not need a subsidy. if it is bad, then we should not be throwing money at it when there are greater needs in society such as education, health care and housing.
__label__Attack	subsidizing journalism would give the government control over it
__label__Attack	subsidizing journalism is unfair. you're basically paying someone to spread your own beliefs.
__label__Attack	journalism that is subsidized by the government will lead to censoring the media from reporting negative things about the government.

__label__Position	Chinese products should be banned in India
__label__Support	India has a huge trade deficit with China. For the year 2017-18, India's imports from China are worth $76.2 billion dollars, whereas India's exports to China are worth $33 billion dollars. So, there is a need to reduce this trade deficit.
__label__Support	Imports from China are hurting the businesses of Indian manufacturers, especially Medium Small &amp; Micro Enterprises (MSME) sector. China is able to produce products for cheaper prices because of its mass production methods.
__label__Support	China is blocking India's bid to list Masood Azhar as a terrorist. Not just this, China is blocking India from becoming a member of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) using its veto power. On one hand China wants to maintain good trade relations with India, and on the other hand, it is acting against India in many cases. So, maintaining good trade relations with China may not be a good thing.
__label__Position	The EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom
__label__Attack	We are all for equal rights and opportunities for women, however, modern feminism has gone so far beyond the pale that it can no longer be supported. The BBC has recently found out that 'Some lesbians are increasingly being pressured and coerced into accepting trans women as sexual partners' - in effect fourth-wave feminism has reached the point where males are once again telling females who to have sex with. This must stop.
__label__Position	The EU needs human security approach to ensure peace.
__label__Support	We need a real EU commitment to Policy Coherence for Peace. On one hand, the EU is promoting peace & dignity and on the other hand, there are investments in hard security tools (defense industry programs).
__label__Support	When college education is free, the number of graduates will drastically increase. At present, many people do not have access to higher education. So many students are not joining colleges due to the financial status of their parents. Free education will be very helpful for them.
__label__Support	At present, the rich are getting richer and poor people are getting poorer. A free college education will reduce social inequality too because as everyone can study and learn the skills in college, everyone will have an equal opportunity to settle in the career of their choice.
__label__Support	Some students are taking education loans to study and then they have to work hard to repay their loans. Many people are forced to take up jobs immediately after college to repay loans. But with free education, they will have the liberty in career choices like choosing a job or becoming entrepreneurs or experimenting with gigs, etc.
__label__Support	There is a shortage of skilled workers in many countries. When college education is free, this problem will be solved.
__label__Attack	At present, private investments in education led to improvement in the quality of education. Without the commercialization of education, the quality of education may not improve much.
__label__Position	We should sponsor the general population for taking in migrants
__label__Support	Industries are also one of the worst hits. Investors may lose interest to invest in manufacturing sector as bandh by anyone results in the loss to them.
__label__Support	Though right to protest is a fundamental right, people do not have right to take away the fundamental rights of others such as going to their work, doing their personal works etc. Not everyone is against to the changes by government. Some people may support it and may not support the ban. Forcing them to stay at home is undemocratic.
__label__Support	Most of the bandhs results in violence. Some political parties and organizations intentionally causes violence by setting public properties on fire, by destroying vehicles and by injuring the common people.
__label__Position	Aadhaar should be made mandatory in India
__label__Support	Reduction of complexity in filling ITR's:

__label__Support	libertarianism promotes political freedom of choice as its core value, and is the ultimate expression of democracy.
__label__Attack	We should not adopt libertarianism because people's lives are better when they know they have a social safety net to fall back on, and that they won't starve if they lose their job.
__label__Attack	libertarianism would be a huge mistake, especially for the poor in our nation.
__label__Support	working together for a greater good favouring the less well off and giving freedom of choice can only benefit society as a whole.
__label__Attack	adopting libertarianism would eliminate many social programs, reducing access t food and health care to those in need
__label__Support	libertarianism allows people to make their own choices without government interference.
__label__Attack	we should not adopt libertarianism for fear of the threat to law and order.
__label__Support	lower taxes and more freedom from big government would be the result if we adopted libertarianism.
__label__Attack	libertarianism is a selfish and dangerous philosophy, devoid of empathy and charity. if it were to become the dominant political system, we would see a huge increase in social inequality.
__label__Attack	without regulations and welfare, society would collapse into vast pools of crime and poverty
__label__Support	Libertarianism increases individual liberties by preventing the government from controlling every aspect of our lives.
__label__Support	libertarians are more fair than other politicians.
__label__Attack	Libertarianism would end all the state run programs that people rely on.
__label__Support	libertarianism disavows government control and allows people to have liberties that have been stifled by the governing body.
__label__Support	libertarianism frees citizens and business owners from expensive regulations
__label__Support	Libertarian foreign policies, being neutral and non-interventionist, help avoid war with other nations.
__label__Attack	we would crumble without services provided to us via the government - roads, fire stations, and more.

__label__Support	it is an interesting concept that even though it hasn't caused much impact yet could possibly be a happy medium between the two existing parties and should be considered.

__label__Support	the government interferes in citizen's lives too much already

__label__Attack	without any sense or order or control, criminals would run rife.

__label__Attack	Libertarianism would lead to crumbling infrastructure without taxes to fund the government.
__label__Attack	Libertarianism would cause chaos in a large country as there would be no set rules and regulations.

__label__Support	there is no need for oppressive restraints on people's behaviour so we should adopt libertarianism.
__label__Support	if we just hold up our beliefs, we will find that libertarianism helps us defend our rights as citizens of this country.
__label__Support	because it protects the rights of the individual to live as they see fit, it promotes acceptance of the rights of all individuals within society, creating a more inclusive society.
__label__Attack	libertarianism would lessen government control and lead to anarchy.
__label__Attack	libertarianism promotes self interest and not that of society as a whole
__label__Attack	libertarianism sounds brilliant as a theory, but government and societies require rules and frameworks to function, and abolishing these would only lead to chaos.
__label__Attack	we should not adopt libertarianism because the government would have too much control over people
__label__Attack	we need more government and less libertarianism.
__label__Attack	we should not adopt libertarianism because that would be forcing a way of life on people that don't want it

__label__Attack	states needs laws and governing bodies, otherwise there could be anarchy. we should therefore not adopt libertarianism.
__label__Attack	Libertarianism sounds good to those who are comfortable with their lot in life, but it perpetuates the gaps between the rich and the poor by minimizing and even eliminating assistance for the weakest in our society.
__label__Support	we should adopt libertarianism because sometimes people need the government to help them make decisions that are best for them

__label__Support	libertarianism reduces the oppression of big government and gives more freedom to the pople
__label__Position	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately
__label__Support	I opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.
__label__Support	I opt without a doubt that the Balkan countries should be already accepted as EU members so that their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.
__label__Position	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__Position	Temples in India can have Gender-Specific rules
__label__Position	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__Support	The COVID crisis has shown, that we are very vulnerable. Critical industries must stay in Europe. Infrastructure in the EU especially critical infrastructure must remain under full and absolute European control.
__label__Support	It will bring the EU more jobs, less unemployment, and more added value.
__label__Position	We should prevent the surveillance state
__label__Position	Imprisonment of foreign criminals should be carried out in their country
__label__Support	Integration and immigration in a host country require a lot of effort
__label__Support	This will relieve the European prison system. This would encourage many migrants to take responsibility for the laws of the host countries.
__label__Attack	Gas power plants produce CO2. Climate-damaging methane is released during extraction and transport, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste - a legacy for future generations - not to mention the current danger of release, e.g. through attacks, geological events, or operational accidents due to human or technical errors.
__label__Attack	If we continue investing in climate and environmentally damaging, regressive, and immensely expensive nuclear power plants or technologies is a mockery of the world and a waste of money and time that we can use for sustainable investments and transformations.
__label__Attack	Europe has more than enough ideological disputes within its own borders. We must settle those first - by falling back on a previous, more classical liberal position that was uncontroversial for most of our citizens. Countries outside the EU must deal with their own problems as best they can. Less interference from Europe is the order of the day, not more.
__label__Position	We should further develop robotization
__label__Position	European Union should help young people to train in refugee countries
__label__Support	This should help to tackle the causes of lack of prospects and absconding from these countries in order to increase the willingness of young people to stay in their homes

__label__Attack	economic sanctions have had a positive effect on denuclearization
__label__Support	economic sanctions can cause hardship and create unnecessary problems.
__label__Support	economic sanctions don't work because countries can get around them therefore we should end their use as a negotiation tactic
__label__Support	economic sanctions cause a weight on country governments that have violated human rights, dangerous acts, et al and the only thing that governments can relate to are monetary hardships.
__label__Support	sanctions ultimately only hit the general population of the country affected, especially the vulnerable. this serves to stir up bad feeling towards the countries implementing the sanction.
__label__Attack	we should not end the use of economic sanctions because they help the nations with exports and imports of goods
__label__Attack	economic sanctions must be retained as it is the only way in which dishonest countries can be made to mend their ways.
__label__Support	Economic sanctions are immoral and hurt the people they are supposed to be protecting.
__label__Support	economic sanctions hurt poorer citizens
__label__Attack	we should not end the use of economic sanctions because penalties should be applied once a self governing state is proved to be needed to be penaliozed
__label__Attack	economic sanctions allow countries to try to curb bad behavior short of war.
__label__Attack	if a government is doing something wrong like apartheid we should not be trading with them as it shows support for that behaviour.
__label__Support	economic sanctions affect the poor more than the tyrants
__label__Attack	we should not end the use of economic sanctions because in the long term they can achieve significant results such as the end of the apartheid regime in south africa
__label__Attack	economic sanctions can put pressure on the regime in power. it reduces their ability to buy weapons of oppression and the ability to keep their economy healthy. it can be effective in the right circumstances.
__label__Support	you cannot push another country just because you don't approve of their behaviors
__label__Support	we could not support economic sanctions as it only hurts both countries financially in the long run.

__label__Support	economic sanctions are outdated and does not cause any repercussions.
__label__Attack	economic sanctions offer an effective way to deal with international conflict which does not involve military action.
__label__Support	economic sanctions cause death and suffering for civilain populations, and are wildly unfocused as a tool of diplomacy.
__label__Attack	we should support economic sanctions to keep others from violating interests
__label__Support	the only ones that suffer with economic sanctions are the regular citizens of the countries.
__label__Support	the use of economic sanctions should be ended because it is important to keep a good relationship with the countries we trade with.
__label__Attack	cooperation among countries is essential nowadays. avoiding armed conflict when one country's terrorizing others by the use of economic sanctions is a great solution to return that country back more cooperation
__label__Attack	economic sanctions are a way to implement sanctions on a country without the risks of military intervention.
__label__Support	we should end the usage of economic sanctions because it is incredibly cruel to the citizens of the country being sanctioned, especially the poor. sanctions don't necessarily stop wars either.
__label__Attack	you shouldn't have to share what you have with other places who do things that are against your country's beliefs.
__label__Support	economic sanctions have little effect when power is concentrated to an individual like a dictator, because the dictator doesn't care about the suffering of their people.
__label__Support	we should end the use of economic sanctions because they rarely achieve their desired aims while causing unitended harm to large number of people
__label__Support	economic sanctions are not effective.
__label__Support	economic sanctions end up hurting ordinary people more than the targeted governments
__label__Attack	we need these sanctions to protect our security
__label__Attack	economic sanctions help our country.
__label__Attack	economic sanctions keep people from doing bad by costing them precious money
__label__Support	economic sanctions do nothing to those in power and ruin the lives of ordinary citizens instead.
__label__Attack	by imposing economic sanctions against a country you will force them to change the way they are doing things because it creates a hardship for the citizens who will in turn rebel against the government
__label__Attack	without the use of economic sanctions a country has very little way of objecting to another country's actions without resorting to violence.
__label__Attack	economic sanctions are an effective way to limit the ability of corrupt governments
__label__Support	we should end it because it puts restrictions on countries and this way we can freely trade.
__label__Attack	the only way to send a strong message to countries who are danger for our western world is economic sanctions which are most effective and successful.
__label__Attack	by using economic sanctions, we can prevent some countries from increasing their weapons thereby protect other countries.
__label__Support	economic sanctions usually do not prove to be effective and tend to cause hard feelings between the countries involved.
__label__Support	economic sanctions don't work and result to have enemies abroad
__label__Support	economic sanctions rarely hurt those who they are aimed at ,the leaders of nations & instead hurt the people in those countries who can least afford it
__label__Attack	economic sanctions have a measurable impact; if that impact is severe enough, otherwise reluctant parties may agree to negotiations in order to find relief.
__label__Support	economic sanctions should be ended as it usually tends to make life harder for the innocent poor citizens who have no idea about what's going on
__label__Attack	economic sanctions help punish bad behavior
__label__Attack	there are usually totally just reasons for imposing sanctions. those reasons could be political or even sometimes military based, but are usually done for the greater good of all.
__label__Attack	economic sanctions are a good way to get things to happen in a target area
__label__Attack	economic sanctions help end bad behaviors.

__label__Attack	economic sanctions are useful to stop bad actions.
__label__Attack	economic sanctions provide security and ensure that citizens are treated fairly.
__label__Position	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products
__label__Support	If all costs, including CO2 emissions of the production, the extraction of resources and its consequences for the region (environment and humans), ecosystem damage, recycling of the waste, and so on and so forth would be monetized and internalized in the costs of the products, many of our problems would be solved. It would simply make the more environmentally friendly products cheaper than the others and their production economically smarter.
__label__Support	In a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.
__label__Support	why should every country in the EU be sovereign in energy production? Within the countries also not every region is sovereign in this sense. We need to take advantage of the geographic potentials of the european continent for pragmatic solutions
__label__Position	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__Position	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Support	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.
__label__Support	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.
__label__Support	It is absolutely necessary that we have a system of accountability, both for member states and other countries. Human rights and liberties always come first!
__label__Attack	The European Union is not a country and we must respect other countries' electoral choices.
__label__Support	Mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.
__label__Support	Several member states have been turned into dictatorships a year ago, and there is no sign of a return to democracy. Freezing temporarily their EU membership status is to be considered to those where there is no more freedom in crossing borders (BE), even inside borders (DE, FR), no more press freedom (most), no more debate (most), no more press or individual liberty.
__label__Support	To have any credibility when addressing foreign countries regarding issues of human rights violations, curbs on the freedom of speech and press, democracy, and more, the EU must ensure that its Member States meet minimum standards on these fronts too.
__label__Support	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.
__label__Attack	The EU has no business 'promoting democracy' anywhere beyond its borders. Have we not seen sufficiently clearly in the past two decades where 'democracy export' leads?! Freedom bombs and human suffering everywhere. No, the EU must fully respect the sovereignty and national characters of all nations of this world. And that includes its own member states. The EU must immediately return to the letter of the EU treaties, and reaffirm in the strongest term the principles of conferral and subsidiarity.
__label__Support	The EU should do it in an impartial manner and act against all countries regardless of political ideology. The EU should stand out to help all minorities and not just the politically advantageous ones. The oppression of Catalonians and Hungarian minorities outside its border is a constant problem since WW2 and it is completely ignored. If the EU wants to convince the masses, then it can't just cherrypick issues.
__label__Position	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__Support	Without a change in the voting procedure, Europe will not be capable of doing much in this world.
__label__Support	The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.
__label__Position	Europe should change the world for the better for everyone.
__label__Attack	The EU should not get involved in trying to ”spread democracy” with threats and punishments, leave that to the US.
__label__Support	The integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about. Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development? They are as much Europeans as we are.
__label__Position	We should reintroduce nuclear power in Germany
__label__Attack	Do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately. The EU does not have an actual army - not because of bureaucrats but because our member states think they are better alone than united.
__label__Position	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Support	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener. In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.
__label__Support	The incentive to provide free public transport in European cities in the future would make it easier for people, especially in the cities, to accept and appreciate that there will be fewer and fewer cars. People who benefit from current examples are happy about it.
__label__Support	I think the EU should subsidies troubled cash-strapped cities to reduce ticket prices or completely remove any charges so that people are vivisected to hop on the bus rather than in the car. As I student, I would have been in the city center a lot more and spent money around the shops if I could afford the bus fair in the first place.
__label__Position	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__Support	Such a platform if it provides youngsters with free or at least affordable mental-health assistance, will help them finally able to overcome our society’s barriers to taking care of our mental health and emotional well-being.
__label__Attack	There is a reason why these states don't want to join the common currency: their economies are more flexible and doing far better without it. If we really want more countries to start using the euro, we need to make the euro better, not pressure or force others into our inefficient system.
__label__Position	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government.
__label__Attack	We certainly need levels of government at the global, regional, and local levels. Equally, we absolutely need democracy at the global, regional, and local levels. Neither the European nor the national and regional parliaments should be abolished because of the need for global governance for the planet.
__label__Position	We should have all workers working in private enterprises share equity in the company they work for
__label__Position	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	According to the United Nations Convention on the rights of people with disabilities, the European Union “shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities” on political decisions that concern them. Meanwhile the “European Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030” hardly mentioned people with intellectual and neurological disabilities. Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities. Ableism keeps getting perpetuated in the EU and it needs to stop. We want more representation! We want people with Down Syndrome to be fully included in the European Union institutions!
__label__Support	Aborting children with Down is not love, is not an inclusive society, it is discrimination against the most vulnerable.
__label__Support	People with trisomy 21 in Europe have much higher rates of unemployment, social exclusion, poverty, and discrimination. The European Union must make it a priority to change this situation.
__label__Support	Europe must lead the way when it comes to integrating people with Down syndrome
__label__Support	The United States is investing an average of more or less 25 million euros per year on health care research for people with Trisomy 21 while the European Union is lagging far behind with only 3 million per year. This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21.
__label__Support	A common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data. The data should be accessible for public research and used for monitoring public health e.g. by European institutions
__label__Position	We should subsidize space exploration
__label__Attack	there are more important things to spend public funds on such as health care, housing and education.
__label__Support	there is so much more to explore and learn about space that subsidising space exploration would bring us closer to learning and understanding what is beyond our planet.
__label__Attack	there are much more important things to spend money on; space exploration is a low priority and should not be subsidized
__label__Attack	space exploration is a waste of money that could be used to feed people
__label__Support	space exploration is the next frontier.
__label__Attack	we should not subsidize space exploration because there are far more important things to spend public money on closer to home such as healthcare, education and transport infrastructure
__label__Support	we need to subsidize space exploration in order to find an inhabitable planet we can live on when we finally destroy the one we live on now.
__label__Attack	space exploration doesn't have any immediate benefits for the general public
__label__Attack	Space travel has health dangers. Astronauts and space tourists face risks from radiation, which can cause illness and injure organs.
__label__Support	we should subsidize space exploration because someday we may have to leave earth behind once we deplete all our resources or because of a nuclear war.
__label__Attack	there is nothing that can come from space research that will help the country so why waste so much money?
__label__Support	space exploration has the ability to solve the problem of limited materials on earth
__label__Attack	subsidizing space exploration takes money away from more important issues.
__label__Support	we need to subsidize space exploration so we can find somewhere for the human race to go when we finally get done destroying our planet.
__label__Support	space exploration needs our support to help us understand the universe and our place in it.
__label__Attack	space exploration is a waste of taxpayers money and should be funded by private enterprises.
__label__Attack	humans shouldn't colonize space until we learn to care for earth
__label__Support	we need to explore space so we can find minerals that are getting depleted on our planet
__label__Support	subsidizing space exploration is a positive move to help advance our space program.
__label__Attack	we have too many problems here on our own planet to worry about putting money into searching space.
__label__Support	we should subsidize space exploration because it is beneficial for educational purposes
__label__Support	The natural resources on earth are dwindling, we have to subsidize space exploration in order to find an outlet for this horrifying situation.
__label__Support	space exploration is vital to the future of humanity, when we destroy this planet, we will need to have an alternative
__label__Support	space exploration is the last great frontier for scientific discovery and should be publicly funded.
__label__Support	space exploration gives insight into our world and other planets which could be invaluable.
__label__Support	space exploration advances the frontiers of mankind, and could well discover new resources that will be invaluable due to the depletion of those on earth.
__label__Support	the future of the human race will rely on moving to other planets in the future therefore we need to subsidize space exploration to speed up research.
__label__Attack	we should be concentrating on and spending money on making our world a better place then out exploring other worlds and space needlessly.
__label__Attack	space exploration is a drain on money which should be invested in looking after our own planet, therefore, we should not subsidize space explorations.
__label__Attack	in times of austerity, no government can afford the costly exercise of subsidising space exploration.
__label__Attack	space exploration is an extravagance in this era of poverty and injustice, we should concentrate government money on those areas instead.
__label__Support	the future of mankind may depend on the ability to travel in space
__label__Support	space exploratin gives us an advantage over other countries such as satellite usage to target enemy combatants and nuclear arsenals.
__label__Attack	we should not subsidize space exploration because that money could be spend on much more pressing matters like helping the homeless and research into cures for cancer.
__label__Attack	it costs too much money to explor space, it could be used elsewhere to benefit humans
__label__Attack	Space exploration is expensive and money should not be wasted on something that will probably never improve life on earth.
__label__Attack	space exploration is already being funded and if a private business is interested in it they've got to pay for it
__label__Attack	space exploration should be privatized and maybe we'd get somewhere.
__label__Attack	The government is already in debt and subsidizing space exploration is not necessary.
__label__Attack	there are already too many problems in the world that could use the resources more than space.
__label__Attack	We should not subsidize space exploration as there are far more important and urgent issues to deal with on earth at this time.
__label__Support	we need to find a new planet with resources before we use ours up, putting more into space exploration would help accomplish this.
__label__Support	space exploration is invaluable because it may help us to find solutions for global warming or even planets that can sustain human life.
__label__Support	by subsidizing space exploration we can work toward colonizing other planets and reduce over population on earth.
__label__Attack	space exploration is an expensive vanity project and subsidization could be abused by military and private interests.
__label__Support	space exploration is a good adventure. our planet is in a future risk of extinct and we should best prepare our refuge in space exploration
__label__Support	science is important and can be beneficial to society.
__label__Attack	there are many more practical realms of scientific inquiry that need our support more urgently.
__label__Support	Space exploration is important. We need a solution to the population, environment, energy and natural resources problems we face on Earth.
__label__Support	we should subsidize space exploration because we're running out of resources on earth. space is filled with infinite resources. if we're not first, other countries will benefit while we're left behind.
__label__Support	many of the technological advances brought about by space exploration have eventual benefits for society in general.
__label__Attack	space exploration is a waste of time and money and we should focus on sustaining earth
__label__Support	Space exploration should be subsidized because the information learned from it could provide useful to our planet.
__label__Support	space exploration is needed to further our nations scientific knowledge. it should be supported by government. there is no profit in it but is vital to our nation and should be undertaken with public dollars.
__label__Support	space exploration is needed to see how space can affect us here
__label__Attack	the space exploration can be private and get money from private funds, why should we keep it?
__label__Support	space exploration may be of tremendous benefit to mankind but isn't practical for private enterprise to fund because of the enormous costs involved
__label__Attack	we should not subsidize something like space exploration because it would put lives at risk.
__label__Support	space exploration should be subsidized as it will benefit us in the future with technology advancements.
__label__Attack	Subsidies are a zero sum game, by subsidizing space exploration we are neglecting more important fields such as education or affordable housing.
__label__Attack	space exploration should not be subsidized because it is not affordable. there is not enough money available in mostcountries to even support health care and security without space exploration too.
__label__Attack	we should not subsidize space exploration since that is a waste of money.
__label__Attack	space exploration is such a costly exercise that subsidising would put an enormous strain on any country's finances that can be ill afforded when there are so many more causes that need supporting on earth.
__label__Attack	space exploration is too costly and there aren't enough tangible benefits to justify subsidization
__label__Attack	space exploration costs too much money that could be spent on better thing such as helping the poor in society.
__label__Support	the country needs to be prepared against other countries that use space exploration to advance both offensive and defensive strategies
__label__Attack	space exploration need only be done by the private sector.
__label__Support	developments in science and technology have been accomplished through space exploration
__label__Support	the technology we get from space exploration alone is worth the cost of it
__label__Attack	the country only has a certain amount of money, and it would be used better to help people here on earth than to explore space.
__label__Support	from exploring other planets we can learn more about our own.
__label__Support	space exploration is important for the development and growth of human society and knowledge and should be invested in by the government.
__label__Attack	we shouldn't subsidize space exploration because it can be very costly
__label__Attack	Space exploration is a field which the private sector is fully capable to fulfill, as Elon Musk shows us.
__label__Support	space mining could help us find valuable minerals that are useful
__label__Support	we need to continue to explore space as it is part of our world.
__label__Attack	space exploration is a bottomless money pit that completely fails to justify the enornomous quantity of revenue pumped into it.
__label__Attack	we just don't have enough excess funds yo support this type of exploration.
__label__Support	The technology developed for space exploration has also had uses in regular life -- subsidizing space exploration would also have positive trickle down effects.
__label__Attack	subsidizing space exploration is extremely expensive and takes money away from projects that need it now.
__label__Support	space exploration provided scientific discoveries that were not thought of before
__label__Support	space exploration technology can lead to benefits here on earth. the ballpoint pen was invented by a space program and now people everywhere use them!
__label__Attack	there are more immediate needs here on earth, there's no reason to explore space. we have to care for what we have already.
__label__Attack	space exploration isn't necessary so the money could go to much more useful things such as education for children and providing health care for people.
__label__Attack	space exploration is not yielding anything useful to society and should not be subsidized.
__label__Support	we should subsidize space exploration to find what information is available in our solar system.
__label__Attack	the money spent on subsidizing space exploration could be better spent on other things that help all of society
__label__Attack	the money used on space exploration could be used on alternative initiatives such as an health and combating poverty.
__label__Support	we should because we can still learn so much about space.
__label__Position	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency
__label__Support	Maize biogas plants need more energy to operate than they supply. Should a free-area PV plant have a ten-fold higher efficiency on this arable land, the biogas plant should not be supported.
__label__Position	Every young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least
__label__Attack	If young Europeans are living abroad they will feel racism on their own in the country they are living in.
__label__Attack	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.
__label__Attack	If young Europeans are living abroad they will feel racism on their own in the country they are living in.
__label__Attack	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.
__label__Position	The EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation
__label__Attack	Ukraine will move forward on its European path when it allows Hungarian kids living on its territory to study in their native tongue, not a day sooner.
__label__Position	Kids' reality shows should be banned
__label__Attack	Reality shows give opportunity for children to bring out their hidden talents and to train their skills. It gives them a sense of purpose and direction from a very young age. The present education system doesn’t include other career options such as singing, acting, dancing, games, etc. Reality shows closes this loophole in the education system.
__label__Support	Reality shows put enormous pressure on participants to perform well every time. Children cannot handle this stress, and this may cause mental health issues. Almost all reality shows involve the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Facing defeat in front of everyone is not that easy for children. This may put an emotional toll on children.
__label__Support	These days, many songs and dances in movies are not supposed to be seen by children. Singing and dancing to these obscene songs will exploit children’s innocence and creates confusion in their minds.
__label__Position	Experimenting on Animals is fair
__label__Attack	We have no right to suffer animals, even though there are benefits for us.
__label__Attack	Tests can be done on human volunteers with their consent. But animals are forced to take tests with no choice.
__label__Position	We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology
__label__Position	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed
__label__Support	Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).
__label__Position	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__Support	Nothing illustrates to me more the fall of European ethics than pro-abortion arguments. Nobody can dispute that a baby in the womb is alive and human, and yet people call their killing a 'human right'. How could we fall so low?
__label__Support	Juridical protection of dignity, right to life, and integrity of every human being from conception are of fundamental importance for the future of Europe. The dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle vs Greenpeace case, which recalls the definition of the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit that presuppose the destruction of human embryos.
__label__Support	We are all here to fight the prohibition of eugenic practices such as abortion which organize and consequently encourage the preventive elimination of individuals who do not comply with the social, medical, and family criteria set by the ideal of man. What a perfect 21st century!
__label__Support	From the Association Christian in Democracy (Spain), we are clear that life is the greatest good of a society and as such must be protected from its conception to its natural end. For this reason, it should be part of the European Union's charter of fundamental rights and be protected from attacks against defenseless human beings, such as in the cases of abortion and euthanasia.
__label__Support	The defense of the equality of value and dignity of each and every single human life is decisive for the future of Europe.
__label__Attack	Direct democracy is too open to manipulation by populists and malefactors via social media. A transparent representative democracy with a solid lid on lobbyism is to be preferred.
__label__Position	Marital rape should be criminalized in India
__label__Attack	Consensual sex can also be termed as rape if the wife is willing to file a false case. There will be no proof to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men based on the mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.
__label__Attack	The most misused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to file a case on a husband and his family in case of dowry harassment. Many women are using this law to extort money and property from their in-laws. If the law on marital rape comes into effect, many innocent men will be at threat.
__label__Support	Sexual violence violates human rights, irrespective of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates against married women for using the section on their husbands. Though one can file a case under the domestic violence act for marital rape, not terming marital rape as a crime will deter the victims from filing cases. Every law on the planet is prone to be misused. That doesn’t mean that we should not have laws in order to avoid false cases.
__label__Attack	Article 15 of Indian constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender. But the proposed law on marital rape in the petitions recognizes only female victims. Hence it is discriminatory to male victims.
__label__Attack	Punishing men based on mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.
__label__Support	IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates married women from using the section on their husbands.
__label__Position	We should stop using cash
__label__Support	A cashless economy saves so much money for governments because printing money, and sending the money to banks requires money and human resources. The need to purchase or rent land for ATMs will also be eliminated. International payments will also be easier because there is no need to exchange currency.
__label__Support	Cashless transactions leave digital footprints of financial transactions. They can be used to trace illegal activities.
__label__Support	COVID Pandemic increased the number of cashless transactions. They can prevent the spread of contagious diseases.
__label__Attack	Cashless transactions are recorded by banks. So, the data will reveal the critical data of people regarding where they spend money. The government can easily access the data of anyone. It may result in mass surveillance programs. This goes against the right to privacy. Cash gives us anonymity.
__label__Attack	A cashless economy will increase the number of cybercrimes.
__label__Attack	Technical issues in banking can halt access to our money. This can interfere with our daily lives.
__label__Position	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__Attack	No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget. And until the democratic deficit and other systemic problems in the EU are fixed, it's good that the budget is kept at 1-2% of the total EU GDP.

__label__Position	We should restrict immigration.
__label__Attack	First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.
__label__Support	Take as example airplanes - how so, that it is so common to be able to search for tickets using one of many webpages or apps, but we actually cannot do the same for trains? Trains are more ecological.

__label__Position	Triple Talaq should be abolished
__label__Support	Triple Talaq is a provision in Islamic personal law that allows men to divorce their wives by saying Talaq three times. Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination, and the right to live with dignity because this provision is available only for men and not women. Women are subjected to live in fear of being unilaterally divorced by their husbands. This violates their right to live with dignity.
__label__Attack	Triple talaq should happen in three stages with time gaps. This allows time for reconciliation and arbitration. As instant divorce is a misuse of triple talaq, banning the provision itself is not the solution.
__label__Support	Triple Talaq does not follow Quranic guidelines of discussion, arbitration to settle disputes, witnesses to divorce, the specified time period to reconcile, or even a genuine attempt to resolve differences.
__label__Attack	It is part of their faith and personal laws can’t be challenged. Article 25 (i) of Indian constitution provides freedom of religion.
__label__Position	We should stop immigration.
__label__Position	The European Union should visible on the facades of the embassies and consulates of European countries.
__label__Support	The European flag should be systematically displayed, in addition to the national flag, on any facade of an embassy or consulate of a European country. This would enhance the image of the European Union in addition to synergies like the pooling of support services. This approach could accompany the construction of common structures and policies in the field of foreign affairs.
__label__Position	We should use available solutions to make flying more sustainable right now
__label__Position	The EU should establish a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
__label__Support	CBAM is a central element towards a global approach to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and to mitigate global warming
__label__Position	The current differing legal cultures of the Member States need to be developed into a common legal culture in Europe
__label__Attack	Legal traditions are different for a reason. They are the result of centuries of organic legal evolution. They cannot be overwritten with a stroke of a pen.
__label__Attack	It's not a good idea to pursue further enlargement. The greater the territory, the harder it is to control and keep problems from appearing. Every large empire in history fell because it grew to such size that it couldn't be properly managed and ruled over. Examples from history don't become suddenly invalid because we're living in the 21st century.
__label__Position	The Commission should remove any mention of gender and other ideology from its research funds and calls.
__label__Support	'Gender' is a far-left concept that has nothing to do with biology, the physical universe, and reality.
__label__Position	Adultery should be criminalized
__label__Support	The language barrier and a weak influence on local thinking, allow local propaganda to pass on distorted and untrue information about what is happening in the EU to their citizens. Local governments have easy work to appropriate the positive things that the EU has achieved and, conversely, seduce its own failure on 'European bureaucracy'.
__label__Position	We should deal with gender inequality
__label__Position	We should create a pan-European train company
__label__Position	We should ban algorithmic trading
__label__Support	algorithms may not be 100% accurate and reflect the situation in the real market
__label__Support	algorithmic trading should be banned as it manipulates the economy to benefit stockholders.
__label__Support	algorithmic trading should be banned because it gives some people an unfair advantage.

__label__Attack	algorithmic trading provides people with more opportunities when it comes to trading.

__label__Attack	algorithmic trading allows for greater numbers of trades to happen, getting more people involved in the economy
__label__Attack	algorithmic trading is cost effective because it is timely and accurate.
__label__Attack	algorithmic trading is faster and more accurate than human guesswork and so provides greater value to shareholders.
__label__Attack	programmes will always evolve to make better use of trading practices, so holding people back from using algorithmic trading will only serve to slow down progress.
__label__Support	we should ban algorithmic trading because most people have no idea how it works and if it is good for them or not

__label__Attack	algorithmic trading allows for more timely, accurate, and efficient trading.
__label__Support	algorithmic trading can cause unnatural market movements.
__label__Support	algorithmic trading gives people an unfair advantage because they can trade so much more quickly and therefore it should be banned.
__label__Attack	Algorithmic trading can operate 24 hours a day. While you sleep, your algorithms are making you money.
__label__Support	algorithmic trading is unfair and doesn't allow for the individual to make money that doesn't have the algorithim.
__label__Support	Algorithmic trading allows computers to buy and sell assets suddenly and in massive quantities, creating shifts in the market and making human trading difficult.
__label__Support	algorithmic trading can be manipulated and used for nefarious reasons
__label__Attack	algorithmic trading can do a job that humans are not able to do
__label__Attack	this helps traders make more informed decisions

__label__Attack	trading using an algorithm is more accurate, quicker, and easier.
__label__Attack	algorithmic trading merely enables better decisions in investments utilising technology and intelligence
__label__Attack	algorithmic trading enables a more level playing field in the trading of shares.
__label__Support	algorithmic trading can cause rapid fluctuations in the stock market that are far beyond human control and no safeguards are implemented to stop them as well as giving unfair advantage to large-scale traders.
__label__Support	we should ban algorithmic trading because theres is scientic advance
__label__Attack	if the technology exists then it should be okay to use it
__label__Support	algorithmic trading gives an unfair advantage to those who have access to such technology and results in losses for the "little guy".
__label__Support	algorithmic trading should be banned as the software can be hacked by criminals.
__label__Support	Algorithmic trading causes substantial job loss for employees in the economic sector with few benefits to the market overall.
__label__Support	algorithmic trading may be an artificial manipulation of the market.
__label__Attack	algorithmic trading allows computers to make predictions based on far more data than a human could handle. this means that more money is likely to be made for share holders.

__label__Position	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming
__label__Attack	Achieving excellence in anything takes time. Through graduation, students gain so much knowledge in the relevant field. So, it’s easier for employers to train these students for the industrial requirements.
__label__Support	Any skill can be learned and mastered even if we do not have a degree in that. And programming is no exception.
__label__Support	Even if someone has a degree in IT, they have to learn so many things to get into the IT job, because there is a gap between the industrial standards and the skills that are taught in Engineering colleges. Moreover, as technology is constantly evolving, even if someone has prepared themselves for the industrial standards in their graduation, they have to learn new technologies continuously to stay relevant in the job market. So, as the learning curve will be there even for IT students, students from non-IT backgrounds can also learn these things and can get into IT jobs.
__label__Support	The number of IT jobs is increasing at a rapid rate due to the tech revolution. So, there will be more jobs in the IT field. And if the recruiters are very strict about the degree, they may miss a large pool of talent, who are of a non-IT background.
__label__Support	Now, we have so many online course platforms through which we can learn almost any skill from experts. We can also get certificates if we pass the tests. So, as Tim Cook said a 4-year degree seems old and traditional.
__label__Support	In many of India’s engineering colleges, we can easily pass the subjects even if do not have much knowledge in those subjects. That is the reason many companies are not able to find suitable talent even if there are so many eligible graduates. So, the willingness to become an expert in the field is more important than a degree.
__label__Attack	If a student from non-IT background chose to start a career in the IT field, the efforts they put into graduation will go in vain.
__label__Attack	Even though the new programming languages are replacing the old ones, the basic concepts are the same for almost all the programming languages. So, the one who has a degree in coding will have an advantage over the student from a non-IT background.
__label__Support	People switch careers even after working in one field for several years because our interests do change. So, when someone can do this while having so many personal responsibilities, it is much easier for youngsters to learn a new skill.

__label__Support	prayer should be not done in school, children are in school to learn

__label__Attack	The administration of justice is a member state competence. Shadowy attempts by federalist institutions to enhance their influence at the expense of the sovereign member states are contrary to the letter of the EU Treaties, counter-productive, and have contributed greatly to the crisis of the EU by alienating national institutions. This is especially the case for courts. Several member states' high courts have declared the ECJ ultra vires (acting beyond its powers). This lawlessness on the part of federalist institutions must stop with immediate effect, and we must reaffirm the principles of subsidiarity and conferral.
__label__Support	it would help to further unite the nations.
__label__Support	During the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states. Gathering the strength of the 27 member states in research and health could be a real asset for the EU and its citizens, but also for its influence overseas and its independence.
__label__Support	I think the problem in the EU is the incompetence to establish inventions in the market. There are lots of inventions that are made and funded by public EU research facilities brought into the market by small startups. In the end, they are picked like ripe fruits by the US or Chinese companies where the big money is made.

__label__Attack	we should not cancel pride parades because it is a right in this country to express yourself and they are doing nothing wrong.
__label__Support	pride parades are often have displays of almost naked people and sexual imagery.
__label__Attack	We should not cancel pride parades simply due to freedom of expression, any group can express themselves.
__label__Support	pride parades are too costly to the cities that hold them in terms of police protection and permitting
__label__Attack	cancelling pride parades would make people less aware of the lgbt movement.
__label__Attack	pride parades are a way for people to express their individualities and rights.
__label__Attack	pride parades should be allowed to continue as it allows people to celebrate diversity among human beings.
__label__Support	pride parades are a legacy of a by-gone time when equal rights for gay men and women was not on the horizon.
__label__Support	we should cancel pride parades as we need to stop support single groups of people as it only causes more strife.
__label__Support	pride parades can be flash points for trouble and a magnet for extremist groups, and consume thousands of police hours to ensure safety.
__label__Attack	we live in a country of freedom of speech and this is embodied in the celebration of diversity such as pride parades.
__label__Attack	pride parades are a support mechanism to allow gay people to feel that they are not alone and can be proud of who they are.
__label__Attack	all are made to feel welcome and included in pride parades
__label__Attack	pride parades are a form of expression and should be given the same consideration as any other type of parade.
__label__Attack	we should not cancel pride parades because they have the right to celebrate too.
__label__Position	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__Attack	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.
__label__Support	Real democracy cannot do without economic democracy. If the major decisions about our future life (investments, inventions, production) are made outside social control, then there is no real democracy. Without proper social consultation, there is no prospect for a fair Europe.
__label__Support	We need to strengthen citizens' trust in the European project! This requires more transparency and accountability, in particular when it comes to access to documents and democratic decision-making. The 'Better Regulation' approach of the Commission which focuses on cutting costs and burdens prioritizes business interests over general interests and should be abandoned. The European project needs to benefit the many and not the few!
__label__Support	Decision-making is today made unilaterally minding short-term economic interests and employers' demands. We need a social, progressive policy in the EU.
__label__Support	It is also very important that the EU does not destroy national progressive labor laws and social protection provisions in third-party countries via Agreements as it tried with Switzerland and the Institutional Framework Agreement.
__label__Support	Europe needs a proper parliament including a right to initiative combined with strong involvement of social partners, e.g. through European Social Dialogue or the partnership principle in regional funds.
__label__Support	We all want to see transparent, democratic, and value-based policy-making. The right to good administration is embedded in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and should guide the EU's actions.
__label__Attack	Just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?
__label__Attack	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!

__label__Position	We should protect the European border.
__label__Position	EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen”
__label__Support	Stop woke ideology introducing Orwellian newspeak!
__label__Position	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__Support	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate. The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country. There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes. Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.
__label__Position	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
__label__Position	E-voting brings more harm than good
__label__Position	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU
__label__Attack	It's the same with citizens of the USA using Americans to describe themselves. Yes, technically it isn't correct, but who cares...
__label__Support	The only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans. This must change.
__label__Support	The political composition of the European Council - and therefore the EU’s political center of gravity - continuously changes during the EU political cycle, thus preventing clearer government majorities to emerge within these two European Councils.
__label__Support	National elections synchronization would finally make it possible to strengthen the effectiveness of the Council of the EU, by eliminating the blockages caused by the constant renewal of Ministers, which considerably slows down decision-making.
__label__Support	Synchronizing national elections would allow European citizens to engage in major pan-European campaigns.
__label__Position	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__Support	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.
__label__Position	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Support	Less disruption to public life, less road traffic, and less loss to our economy. As all the government staff can be used at a single time, we can also increase vigilance, and factors like black money, booth capturing, etc. can be reduced.
__label__Attack	Holding both elections together will also mean mixing up the national issues with those of the state. The national issues would overpower the state which in turn would get less priority from the politicians.
__label__Attack	When state elections are conducted along with the center the regional parties may get marginalized because the same party getting majority in the center may get votes in the state as well.
__label__Attack	Frequent elections in the country will bring politicians back to the public frequently whereas cutting down on elections would mean making them lazy for the rest of the term and suddenly becoming overactive during the election year.
__label__Position	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__Support	The cohesion funds have become a mechanism for local oligarchs and political elites to maintain their power and influence within national contexts, thus resulting in utilizing EU funds for their own personal or political gains and withholding the benefits from the people in cities and regions.
__label__Support	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.
__label__Position	We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging
__label__Position	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__Support	it is essential that environmental concerns and sustainability are the foundation of any treaty with our European Union!
__label__Attack	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.
__label__Attack	Migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?

__label__Attack	Migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?
__label__Position	We should invest in nuclear energy
__label__Support	The EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life. To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.
__label__Position	EU needs an action plan against digital addiction
__label__Attack	Technology brings people together when they are distant, accelerates bureaucratic procedures, it allows us to work from home or from any country in the EU or outside. It allows for an immense flow of information to be easily accessible to us. As long as people do not want to do illegal online activities, it is each person’s individual decision what to do with their own online time or how much time they might want to be online.
__label__Attack	Forty years of UK membership in the European Union have clearly proven that it is not a good idea to conclude agreements with England.
__label__Support	Both, a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism are overdue.
__label__Position	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__Support	In fact, political NGOs advocating for any cause whatsoever should be banned from schools and kindergartens.
__label__Support	As Europe bears the burden of the XXth century authoritarian regimes (right and left) and saw their children ideologically possessed by fascist and communist governmental propaganda (Hitlerjugend (right) and Pioneer (left) movements), we need to limit the access of the children - as one of the most vulnerable groups of our community - to every political ideology and propagating associations.
__label__Attack	This bill gave exclusive powers to the ‘National Investigation Agency’ (NIA). NIA can take any person into their custody under UAPA without taking prior permission from the state government. This is against the federalism, which is guaranteed by the constitution of India.
__label__Attack	Labelling organisations as terror organisations and labelling individuals as terrorists are quite different. If a person is named as a terrorist, he/she will face social exclusion and will be devoid of livelihood opportunities even if he/she proved otherwise. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone 67% of the cases ended in acquittal, which means they are probably innocent.
__label__Attack	If someone is booked under UAPA, the burden of proving their innocence is on them. This new amendment is enabling the government to seize their properties. Then how will they pay for legal expenses to prove their innocence, if they are falsely accused?
__label__Attack	This will provide more police powers to the central government. The provision of naming individuals as terrorists can be misused. For example, recently several civil activists are termed as Urban Naxals. If anyone opposes the government, they will be vulnerable to be framed as terrorists. Because this amendment made it easier to label anyone as a terrorist.
__label__Support	There is a growing threat of lone-wolf terrorism. Lone wolf terrorists do not have any association with terrorist organizations, but they commit terror attacks alone by themselves. This new amendment to UAPA has the potential to curb lone-wolf terrorism.
__label__Support	To prevent the violation of human rights, four-stage scrutiny is added. Designating individuals as terrorists is not started by India. The US, European Union, and China also have this provision.
__label__Support	Till now, only organizations were designated as terrorist organizations, but not individuals. The loophole in this is the individuals of the banned organizations are forming new organizations and carrying out terror activities. This amendment bill for the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists, thereby terror attacks can be prevented.
__label__Support	There is a need to act tough on terrorism amid growing threats from terrorists. So, strengthening UAPA is necessary.
__label__Position	We should make pushbacks legal
__label__Position	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__Support	Refugees are forcibly displaced. They flee their country for several reasons such as violence, human rights violations, war, persecution of minorities, etc. Often they face threats to life in their home countries. They leave their homes and everything else in search of a safer place to live.
__label__Support	At present, many countries are refusing refugees stating that they pose an economic or security threat. Only a few countries including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Liberia are accepting most of the refugees. Some host countries are forcibly sending refugees back to their home countries stating that such as the situation in their home countries is safe. Many refugees who were sent like this went through brutal violence and some people even disappeared.
__label__Support	All countries should share the responsibility for refugees. Resettlement of the refugees should be done without much delay. They should be provided with skill development courses and employment opportunities to help them in living a dignified life.
__label__Support	A weak global response is worsening the situation of refugees. The international community should help in rebuilding the war-torn countries, where refugees are coming from, so that safe and dignified returns are possible for refugees. Refugees should not be forcibly sent to their home countries.
__label__Support	Many developed countries are spending so much money to protect their borders, but are not spending any money for protecting the lives of refugees. More funding is required to protect refugees.
__label__Position	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Support	This is especially true when we know how much alcohol is damaging the brain, in particular in the developing brain of teenagers. Also unlike cannabis, over-consumption of alcohol leads to death so I would say that this product is much more dangerous. Yet unlike cannabis, alcohol is legal.
__label__Support	In France, political repression fueled by rightwing ideology and ignorance led cities like Marseille to develop rampant crime that fed on the lucrative market of cannabis. Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing.
__label__Support	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.
__label__Support	Today, cannabis repression is simply a political posture aimed to target rightwing voters, not a rational policy.
__label__Support	Whenever you find yourself in crisis, and the EU is in crisis, it is a good idea to return to core business. And in the case of the EU, the core business is economy, trade, and security. That's where the focus should be.
__label__Support	The more dynamic the economy, the stronger the innovation and worldwide influence the EU will have, including soft power.
__label__Support	The Covid-19 pandemic showed us that the European Union is not able to come up with technological innovations that could strengthen our economic position.
__label__Position	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing
__label__Attack	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU. The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU. Almost all people are without a useful education. There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.

__label__Attack	Horrible idea. Next, you will limit water or air?! This is not the way to move on climate change. You can do much more via mass politics and not focus on individuals or limit their freedoms. If you want to stop eating meat, do so, I won't.
__label__Attack	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced. When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.
__label__Attack	No, this is a horrible idea to force people to go vegan. While I agree that we, as a society, are eating too much meat, which is bad for both the environment and our health, this will only create tension and anger towards the EU.
__label__Attack	I have no illusions that rich and influential people will find a way to get as much meat as they want and then distribute it on the black market.
__label__Attack	The government does not have any right to use the taxpayer's money to propagandize the people to encourage what to eat and not to eat. It is not the responsibility of the government.
__label__Attack	I think forcing people to eat a limited amount of meat is totally the wrong way because of the following reasons: 1. It would cause so much more bureaucracy 2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat? 3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.
__label__Position	We need a better EU migration policy.
__label__Support	It is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.

__label__Support	The EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off.
__label__Position	Food whose production has been subsidized with EU funds should not be allowed to be exported to developing countries.
__label__Support	The subsidies were originally intended to ensure the security of supply for the European population. But when you export subsidized food, it's at the expense of European taxpayers. Export yes, but then no more subsidies for these products.
__label__Support	These products come mainly from large enterprises, which do not necessarily focus on environmental protection.
__label__Support	Subsidies often make farmers in recipient countries uncompetitive, hampering local production and increasing migratory pressure.
__label__Support	This will add to the transparency and fair competition. Insincere employers shouldn't have an advantage, and in essence, it would be beneficial for all EU members, not just the workers.
__label__Support	Protection of the rights of those who actually produce the services and products that constitutes the European market is nothing but self-evident. With a more and more integrated EU, ignoring those rights will create fragmentation and conflicts.
__label__Attack	There is no guarantee that illegal gambling activities will stop.

__label__Position	We need see nuclear energy as green energy

__label__Position	There should be a stronger EU on the world scene
__label__Support	Too many times so-called leaders around the world like Trump and Boris Johnson have made a mockery of Europe and Europeans with zero response from EU leaders. These things affect people's pride and give out a sense of weakness.
__label__Support	We have already done great damage to EU credibility by pointless posturing.
__label__Support	EU should show more strength when dealing with foreign powers. In addition, there should be a vision about where we want to go in the long term with the EU, and this is in an increasingly complex (and sometimes hostile) world.
__label__Position	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
__label__Position	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.

__label__Attack	Reality shows give opportunity for children to bring out their hidden talents and to finess their skills.
__label__Attack	Reality shows act like a launchpad for children into the film industry. Some of the present singers, choreographers are made into the movies through reality shows for children.
__label__Support	Almost all reality shows involves the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Facing defeat infront of everyone is not that easy for children. This may put an emotional toll on children.
__label__Position	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU
__label__Position	The EU must be confederal and not federal
__label__Attack	We need a real and effective European democracy, therefore, a European Federation.

__label__Support	too many people fight and cause wars through religion so it should be banned in favor of atheism
__label__Attack	people have the freedom to religion and forcing them to chose a non religious entity is unconstitutional.
__label__Attack	All beliefs should be recognized not just the one YOU want.
__label__Attack	we should not because everyone needs something to believe in and if there was no religion then people may not follow laws because there is no consequences of bad actions (hell)
__label__Support	atheism is a legitimate belief system that allows a person to think for himself and figure life out in his own way. it should be adopted the same as other belief systems are adopted.
__label__Support	atheism should be the defacto stance as it is the only provable observance of reality, in that there is absolutely no evidence to prove the contrary.
__label__Support	we should adopt atheism because science can explain how we got here without needing a god to explain it.
__label__Attack	this country was founded on christian principles; we cannot abandon these customs.
__label__Support	fewer wars will arise since there will be no fighting over holy lands or differing religions.
__label__Support	atheism could be of great benefit because it would foster more scientific ideas which could prevent our demise from global warming and other looming challenges
__label__Attack	the most basic right we have is freedom of religion, and it is very strong personal belief. atheism strips that away and should not be encouraged.
__label__Support	Atheism should be the norm for a society who wants to live according to their own rules and ideals.
__label__Attack	we should not adopt atheism because it is not a religion
__label__Attack	anyone is entitled to believe in whatever they want, god or no god
__label__Attack	atheism will destroy the world by unleashing godless people running the government with no morals or ethics and should not be adopted.

__label__Support	atheism would take away religious hatred and wars which have caused a huge amount of damage throughout history.
__label__Support	there is no actual proof that god exists. it is all stories passed down no matter which religion. atheism would stop the fighting over which religion is superior.
__label__Attack	the right to practice religion is a personal freedom that cannot be taken away as it is a source of comfort to many.
__label__Attack	we shouldn't adopt atheism because it will lead to most hostile arguments against the religious trying to shove their belief down your throat
__label__Support	there are a lot of religions that take advantage of people. atheism eliminates that from happening.
__label__Attack	people should have the freedom to believe in a way of their choice. atheism forces people to believe in one way and this is not the principle of freedom the usa was founded upon.

__label__Attack	we shouldn't adopt atheism because everyone needs something to believe in, and without no rules (10 commandments) or no promise of a better afterlife, society would collapse

__label__Support	people are so afraid of an imaginary punishment that they do not live their lives to the fullest - with atheism, it will be more convincing to live in the present.
__label__Support	Atheism allows one to really examine why we believe what we do and are you truly a good person or do you just want to go to heaven
__label__Attack	Atheism tends to be literal and negative when people need faith
__label__Attack	atheism should not be adopted as it would be offensive to various religious groups.
__label__Attack	everyone has a right to follow the religion they truly believe, therefore we cannot impose atheism
__label__Support	atheism allows for an even playing field, removes the fighting over which religion is superior over another.
__label__Attack	we are a nation founded on christianity so atheism goes against our natural beginnings.
__label__Attack	no belief or religion should be instituted in a blanket form. people are completely different with very different beliefs. no one way is good for everyone. there should be freedom to believe whatever one wants.
__label__Support	no one has ever been able to prove that god exists. religions convince people of a higher power to get them into church for their own profit,
__label__Support	atheism is simply the end result of rational thinking, refusing to blindly believe in things that are unproven - this is healthier attitude, since religious adherence leads to all mannor of intolerance.
__label__Attack	everyone has a right to believe in anything and follow the religion they think it's most suited for them, so we cannot impose atheism
__label__Support	atheism should be the defacto standard for all people. If individuals choose to believe in unprovable, invisible super beings from space, it should be kept private and out of official/public spaces.
__label__Support	religion has been responsible for some much war and suffering since the dawn of human history, it is time to abandon it completely.
__label__Support	religion has been the root cause of more pain and bloodshed throughout history than anything else - an atheist approach is a healthier way of life than rigid, deathly adherence to a divisive doctrine.

__label__Attack	people are guided by religion on how to conduct their live and its been around for thousands of years
__label__Attack	religion gives people a belief if a better life
__label__Support	religion has been used as justification for many terrible things in the past. we should base our judgements only on what we know s true, and not what might be true.

__label__Support	adopting atheism would eliminate the bickering between religious groups
__label__Attack	People should be allowed to choose how to believe freely and not forced to accept the beliefs of atheism. Each person has a mind and can make their own decision and should be allowed the freedom of choice.
__label__Position	There should be a small council of people from all over the world, and identify the problems of every country and solve them.
__label__Attack	Europe should represent its own interests.
__label__Position	Toilet paper should be made of recycled paper only
__label__Support	In order to improve the protection of the environment, the use of fresh pulp should no longer be allowed for toilet paper.
__label__Position	We should promote a culture of exchange and sharing of goods and services
__label__Position	Companies should fight moonlighting
__label__Attack	Some people moonlight to pursue their passion when the earnings from their passion cannot replace the salary from their main job. Several entrepreneurs take this route and leave their jobs once they earn enough from their new ventures.
__label__Attack	As per a study published by the Academy of Management Journal in 2021, moonlighting can provide a sense of control and motivation, which can improve the productivity of employees.
__label__Attack	The sudden layoffs by several companies especially during the pandemic caused fear in many employees. And hence several people took up side gigs or a second job as a safety net in case they are laid off.
__label__Attack	Moonlighting can help in upskilling. A few people want to learn new skills apart from what they are working on in their primary job. This can help them in developing expertise in their field. Some might get bored with monotonous jobs and hence take up second jobs to learn new skills and thereby make their days exciting.
__label__Support	Companies fear information and sensitive data theft and the possibility of sharing it with their rival companies.
__label__Support	Some managers are worrying that the employees who moonlight may not be productive in their primary job due to fatigue and increased stress. There are also concerns about working for other companies during the office hours of my primary job.
__label__Support	In general, companies provide several benefits to employees such as provident fund, health insurance, etc. So, they feel it is unfair when their employees focus their energy and time on a second job, which doesn’t provide any of those benefits.
__label__Position	Europe should protect bees
__label__Support	We must protect our Planet, and without bees, wasps, or other arthropods, we go to our own extinction!
__label__Support	Without bees, which are dying en masse, Europe’s existence is impossible. The problem is complex and it is about the influence of poisonous pesticides and other agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as the influence of GSM technologies, which lead to overheating of the bee’s body, which falls under the negative impact of microwaves. Therefore, Europe must create a series of policies to help bees survive in the name of the surplus of European nations.
__label__Position	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__Support	If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia. In order to support them we need a European army and a common foreign policy.
__label__Position	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state
__label__Support	The EU should support democracies rather than dictatorships and value the support of democracy over economic gains.
__label__Support	China is acting against European values and violating intellectual property rights.
__label__Support	Recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state coordinated act of the EU, USA, Japan, and Australia. That will make any retaliation from China much more difficult.
__label__Position	Pay-as-you-go public health insurance funds should only be used for the most serious illnesses
__label__Attack	This only works if you're young and healthy, otherwise, you're a bad risk for private health insurance and it will become even more expensive
__label__Support	They are good time managers. As most of the women today manage work and home, they can prioritize their time well.
__label__Support	In general, they've coherent minds, are punctual and are dedicated to their work. These inbuilt qualities do make them better managers than men.
__label__Support	It is important to see immigrants as people who have a culture, a religious perspective, and a very different but respectable idea of sociality compared to the European one. That's why we must act in a coordinated and careful manner between institutions and organizations.
__label__Support	Such a hub could also have a bridging role between local necessities and opportunities at the EU level, such as project funding.
__label__Support	The hub could also organize events to spread awareness in the local population on topics related to migration, in order to boost social inclusion processes and fight the spreading of fake news and ostracism of migrant people.
__label__Position	Bullet for Bullet is a right policy
__label__Support	These days, every man is considered as a potential rapist. If a woman makes a false molestation complaint against a man out of revenge or any other motive, society is more likely to believe the woman's words. Society and media exposes the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in genuine cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However the same is not true with the complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt about the genuinity of the case. What if the sexual harassment case against the man is a false case? Some people think like men can take anything. False molestation cases will result in the irreversible loss of reputation and causes mental agony to the accused and his family.
__label__Support	Many false domestic violence cases are being reported in India. Girl can drag their in-laws to court, but the same is not true with a boy. In many domestic violence cases, in-laws didn't even stay with couple, but are booked for 'influencing' the boy. Do girl's parents not 'influence' her? And the saddest thing is that girl can complain against her sister-in-law and sister-in-law's husband too under domestic violence, even if they are not staying at her place. Women can be as cruel as men in harassing their life partner.
__label__Support	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration.

__label__Position	We should take polyester and other toxic substances out of clothing and place them with natural materials
__label__Position	We should subsidize print media
__label__Attack	There will be no sense of security. We cannot sleep peacefully because the cryptocurrency’s value keeps on fluctuating. Standard currencies fluctuate too, but not as high as cryptocurrencies. If the value of standard currency falls, we can still afford to live in our country, because the fall of currency value impacts all fields. For example, if the prices of groceries rise, so do our salaries. But if the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin falls, we will lose our hard-earned money.
__label__Support	The future belongs to technology. Cryptocurrencies make peer-to-peer financial transactions a lot easier. This currency can be sent from any part of the world to any part of the world. Hence there will be no struggle of exchanging currencies like Dollars for the Rupee etc. While traveling the world, there will no hurdle of exchanging our currencies with local currencies.
__label__Position	We need a better distribution of refugees.
__label__Attack	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.
__label__Attack	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.
__label__Position	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
__label__Position	Europe must help Ukraine
__label__Attack	Ukraine is infamous for its black market for weapons. Helping Ukraine by dumping weapons into such a country is folly.
__label__Position	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__Support	The EU needs to establish a legal means of preventing illegal migration that is encouraged by the Turkish government and by privately funded NGOs, which are acting against the interest of the EU.

__label__Position	India is safe for women
__label__Attack	being against solar energy, in my opinion, is simply irrational. Insects also die by windmills sometimes, but much more often from hunger, birds or herbicides, insecticides, etc.
__label__Attack	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece.
__label__Attack	What does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate. So people actually have to come to the EU and enter the EU if they want to ask for asylum in the EU. This has caused inhumane and dangerous circumstances as we see in the Mediterranean Sea.

__label__Attack	I don't really agree with that. Europe is not China and is not the USA. We don't need a strong army because Europeans don't plan to make war, our strength is to find common ground and bring peace to the world with diplomacy and intelligence.
__label__Position	We should abolish capital punishment
__label__Attack	capital punishment is sometimes the only option to keep criminals from committing more crimes.

__label__Position	There is a lack of unity in European migration policies.
__label__Attack	For a better migration policy, a European mission could be created to welcome migrants from the coasts of Libya and Tunisia. People welcomed in the centers in North Africa will be re-distributed to the countries of the Union. Are you insane?
__label__Attack	Hydrogen is flammable and can cause fires or explosions. So, it is not completely safe yet.
__label__Attack	If the production of hydrogen fuel uses fossil fuels, that can be counterproductive. So, using renewable energy to produce hydrogen fuel is important.
__label__Support	Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles do not emit greenhouse gases. This helps to fight climate change. As many countries are opting for energy transition, clean hydrogen fuel vehicles along with other alternative fuel vehicles can pave the way to sustainable transportation. Also, as these vehicles do not emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, they can cut air pollution to a great extent.
__label__Support	The prices of fossil fuels are increasing continuously. So, if more hydrogen vehicles come into the market, the price of fossil fuels may reduce.
__label__Support	Hydrogen vehicles are much quieter than fossil fuel-based vehicles. So, they can reduce noise pollution too.
__label__Attack	If the hydrogen fuel escapes into the air, it can increase global warming.
__label__Support	Turkey is encroaching on EU territory, Russia is sending its army to the Ukrainian border, and what can we do? Nothing, because nobody is taking us seriously. Our threats are empty and get ignored, and our diplomacy is weak. It's time for the EU to be recognized as a strong force that can and will protect its people and its interests.
__label__Support	A European army is not only needed to attack and defend but to give weight to European words.
__label__Position	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare for EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__Support	Ukraine is a part of Europe—geographically, diplomatically, and culturally. If Ukraine wants to join the EU, we should grant our brothers and sisters full membership in our Union.
__label__Support	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!
__label__Support	Such competitions and beauty pageant have a very wrong influence on society as we all quickly follow the media trends. All this is basically sending the wrong message to our younger generation girls where they are made to understand that being perfect and pretty is extremely necessary. This affects their self-esteem and may even cause depression.
__label__Support	They promote cosmetic surgeries. Women these days, are ready to spend thousands of dollars on getting hair extensions, fake teeth, botox injections, body implants, spray tans, branded outfits and makeup products. This could be extremely expensive to afford and such expenses are never-ending. Cindy Jackson, a known television star. has a world record of 52 plastic surgeries done by her. Some women can even get addicted to such practices and then theirs no look back. This is the direct influence of society's importance to beauty.
__label__Support	Beauty pageant can increase the objectification of women.

__label__Attack	we should support collectivism because it helps people find common goals.
__label__Support	people should be able to work hard and reap the benefits of their labor. with collectivism you will always have some people doing most of the work and the lazy ones will benefit from it.
__label__Support	collectivism and the impingement of the the government results in people blaming others for their problems rather than looking for solutions themselves
__label__Support	collectivism takes the focus off the individual as well as the ways in which each of us is unique. supporting collectivism means wanting the individual to remain subordinate to society.

__label__Attack	collectivism provides a common goal for everyone to work towards.

__label__Support	we should oppose collectivism because it creates echo chambers in societies that makes it harder for individuals to give their thoughts and opinions on things
__label__Attack	collectivism means that everyone has equal access to facilities.
__label__Support	this practice does not allow an individual their own thoughts and actions.
__label__Attack	we shouldn't oppose collectivism because sometimes you have to look out for what is best for society as a whole and not how it would benefit a specific individual.
__label__Support	collectivism provides no incentive for people to work hard because they have no opportunity to become wealthy.
__label__Support	no two people are entirely alike. ignoring individual differences and needs does not best serve the whole
__label__Attack	In a collectivist society, everyone is considerate of each another and provides support to one another.
__label__Support	collectivism will ultimately fail because it is at odds with basic, self-preservation.
__label__Attack	No one individuals life is any more intrinsically important or valuable than any other person's life, and therefore we should build societies that value the collective and general public over the individual.
__label__Support	collectivism goes directly against the rights of individuals. individual freedom is what this country was founded on. it is rights violative to put the majority above individuals.

__label__Attack	sometimes it's easier to get one's voice across if the voice is heard as a group
__label__Support	collectivism does not allow one person to stand out from the others, which can be negative
__label__Attack	collectivism is necessary for people to help one another and endure.

__label__Support	collectivism encourages herd mentality
__label__Attack	collectivism takes care of everyone and not just those at the top
__label__Support	We should oppose collectivism because while it can be used to help everyone, it gives too much power to the collective to hurt individuals.

__label__Support	collectvism is unfair to the world and is irrational
__label__Support	collectivism focuses on the group as a whole and diminishes the rights of the individual.
__label__Support	collectivism necessarily means that individual freedoms will be reduced, so it does not make sense to adopt it.
__label__Support	While society and the collective may be long lasting, individuals are only afforded a single life, and therefore should prioritize that over the lives of others.
__label__Attack	we should support collectivism, as everyone in the group benefits from this practice.

__label__Position	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work
__label__Support	It seems like a no-brainer to say something like this, but actually the way, we handle soil, must change massively to halt the climate crisis and mitigate its consequences. Thus we need to recultivate and restore abandoned and contaminated places and shift agriculture to regenerative agriculture or restoration agriculture. We need to stabilize family farms and make them ecologically, financially, and socially sustainable. We need between big and medium-sized farms and also highly productive smallholder farms and wildlife reservoirs. This all depends on a lot of labor, engaged people, and legal and conceptual infrastructure. Having all this in place will foster urban areas as well.
__label__Support	If rural areas are to become more attractive to live in and work, it is essential to bet on innovation and the creation of quality jobs
__label__Position	Social media is making us less social
__label__Attack	During the covid pandemic time, social media helped people in maintaining their social life.Social media made it possible to stay connected with friends and loved ones all the time. We can easily know what is happening in their lives. It allowed us to communicate with multiple people at the same time by sharing posts.
__label__Attack	Due to social media, now we have the opportunity to connect with many people, even if they do not live in our area. Before social media, we could interact with people from either our locality or the places we go.
__label__Support	By following friends on social media and not communicating with them privately, we can only know the things they post on their accounts. We may not know much about what is really happening in their lives. That means we will have no meaningful connections with friends. The convenience of contacting people online made us prefer it over meeting them outside.
__label__Support	A few people now have social anxiety due to not having enough face-to-face interactions. When we avoid talking to people for a long time, automatically we develop a fear to involve in small talk.
__label__Support	Trolling on social media is a big menace. It is affecting the self-esteem of many people and is also making them avoid forming social connections.
__label__Support	In the book “iGen”, it was mentioned that in the next decade we may see more young people who know just the right emoji for a situation — but not the right facial expression. This can become true if we prefer virtual life over real life.
__label__Attack	Through close-knit communities or micro-communities based on shared interests on social media along with private messaging, social media gave us an opportunity to build real connections with people we can really relate to.
__label__Position	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
__label__Attack	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity. It would turn Europe into a polarized entity much like the American system and would firmly divide the European community on every issue.
__label__Attack	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will only serve larger nations in the union and small member states would lose all their power and slowly turn into puppets of the larger nations instead of equal partners
__label__Attack	Changing the EU foreign policy voting procedure will cause serious problems.
__label__Support	Giving small countries 'veto rights' is a recipe for disaster that will keep the European Union separated and weak instead of united and reliable in policy making.
__label__Position	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__Position	Alternative medicine should be more accepted
__label__Support	Traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine is a safe and efficient way to improve well-being, and happiness and prevent illness. Also, an innumerable amount of people have got significant palliation or even total cure in cases, which the official health care system, unfortunately, couldn't help. This is clearly an area, where countries, civilizations, and schools of thought could learn a lot from each other.
__label__Attack	A direct election of a European president is a travesty of democracy. It would be only a mediatic competition among 'plastic' leaders. Something very similar to The Simulacra (Dick's 1964 science fiction novel). We are not a 'nation', we are a confederation of nations.
__label__Attack	I don't think the EU needs the same problem as France where the elections are just about which guy people should select and which candidate looks the best to handle the position.
__label__Attack	What will the Europeans think if the candidates are always, for each election, either French, German, or maybe Spanish, and neither coming from small countries?
__label__Attack	To have a chance that one candidate (with a good chance to win) comes from your own country, I think people from little countries can wait 40 years. This will definitely destroy the European belonging feeling you want to promote with this idea.
__label__Position	We need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto.
__label__Attack	If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, e.g. in France where English is being thought in French. language.
__label__Attack	We have already English as a language of exchange.
__label__Attack	English is ideal as it is spoken internationally as the language of commerce, travel, and political exchange. Esperanto isn't.

__label__Support	we need to stop all the shootings that are happening and abolishing the right to keep and bear arms is a good start
__label__Support	guns are much too dangerous and often get in the wrong hands
__label__Support	weapons are very tentative to commit a crime or create a vendetta against another person, that is why it is important to abolish the possession and carrying of arms.
__label__Support	Arms are very bad for the whole of society when they are in the hands of bad persons. giving anyone the right to keep and bear arms puts society in danger
__label__Support	america far and away has the highest gun related homicides of any developed nation, to say nothing of the multiple mass shootings per year.

__label__Attack	We should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms as this is our fundamental right and should not be something for debate.
__label__Support	Guns are designed to kill people, we should be doing everything possible to destroy them and stop their production to save lives, allowing people to keep and bear arms does the absolute opposite of this.

__label__Attack	Accommodating refugees will cause resettling of some Indians. The Indian government tried to give shelter to Rohingyas by resettling some in the Jammu region. This may not be the right step and will cause distress to the resettled Indians.
__label__Support	Rohingyas have their own set of ethnicity and culture. By accepting them, we will just be adding more culture to the already-vast culture of India.
__label__Support	Letting the Rohingya go back to the place where they do not get recognition means more loss of human lives, and to a greater extent. The population of the Rohingya is 1.1 million, and if the violence and torture continues on them, then there will be no person left in the community.

__label__Support	It would be smarter and cheaper to develop and encourage limited speed, low consumption shared thermal cars, and abandon the myth of owning a car.
__label__Support	most of the electric power is produced by thermal power plants that burn oil derivatives and by the nuclear industry. So, until the electric power generation won't be mostly by renewable energies, is basically irrelevant which kind of cars are we using.
__label__Attack	It's by no means irrelevant what kind of cars people use; 25% renewable + 25% nuclear + 50% combustible is better than 100% combustible gasoline.
__label__Attack	non-gasoline cars improve local air quality on city streets.
__label__Position	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU
__label__Support	Agreed. Only if we show that criminals don't have a place in the EU, we can convince our citizens that refugees aren't that much of a threat. Making the checking process that each refugee has to go through public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can just come here and we need to close our borders.
__label__Support	Not only for committing, but also planning. Especially if an immigrant gets caught planning a terrorist act, he/she must be removed from EU permanently.
__label__Support	I agree, no one should migrate to a country if they're going to commit a crime.

__label__Attack	US treaties with Mexico won't let them build anything on the Rio Grande River and the areas around it. Furthermore, most of the areas along the border in Texas are privately owned which leaves a large part of the border uncovered. So, building the wall is not going to bring any change.
__label__Attack	There is a fairly good chance that the wall is never going to make it up. Projects like these take a large amount of time to complete and if in the next Presidential elections, any other person gets elected, there will be more chances of him/her stopping the construction of the wall.
__label__Attack	According to the reports, illegal crossing of the borders has actually decreased from the year 2014 to 2015 which renders no use in building the wall.
__label__Attack	we should not do this because other countries like china already did and it caused an epidemic where there is a huge imbalance of males to females which disrupts the population
__label__Attack	gender selection is essentially playing god.

__label__Attack	sex selection should not be legalized as it is unethical
__label__Attack	sex selection is unnatural and will have long term negative consequences on society. we will become overpopulated with male children and females will become targets of sexual crimes.

__label__Attack	sex selection promotes abortion and gender inequality
__label__Attack	We should not legalize sex selection as this is playing god and can open the door to a raft of other genetic selection that is not thoroughly tested.

__label__Attack	sex is determined at birth and not something a person should be allowed to change or decide for themselves.
__label__Attack	we shouldn't legalize sex selection because some people can't have children at all, they should be happy that they have blessed with a miracle. if you want to choose a sex then foster or adopt a certain sex
__label__Attack	sex selection is playing god, will create gender imbalances and create negative stereotypes concerning male/female preferences.
__label__Attack	we should not legalize sex selection because when we do, we are messing with god's will.

__label__Attack	it will result in more elective abortions and cause a gender imbalance
__label__Support	sex selection should be a choice for parents to make and therefore should be legalized.
__label__Attack	we should not legalize sex selection because this goes against the natural laws of nature.
__label__Support	sex selection is a choice between parents and their doctor; if the parents insist on having a boy to, say, balance out a family full of girls, then what's the problem with that?
__label__Support	there are valid medical reasons for using sex selection to combat certain diseases
__label__Attack	we shouldn't legalize sex selection because is moral action in society
__label__Attack	legalizing the selection of sex goes against the moral and natural principles of society

__label__Attack	sex selection could lead to gender inbalance in some societies.
__label__Attack	sex selection is a slippery slope that may lead to parents picking other traits to screen for, from innocent ones like hair color, to larger ones like iq.
__label__Attack	sex selection can possibly destroy the natural selection and over balance the society.
__label__Attack	sex selection could lead to an imbalance of genders
__label__Attack	every child has a right to be born regardless of their gender so sex selection should not be legalized.
__label__Attack	sex selection could lead to genetic abnormalities and start society on a slippery slope of genetic editing at a time when it is an imperfect, untested procedure that could lead to horrific outcomes.
__label__Attack	sex selection is unethical and morally wrong - no child should be discarded because of their gender.
__label__Attack	Choosing your baby's gender interferes with what nature intended. People should not "play God".
__label__Attack	it should not be legal, it is costly and morally wrong
__label__Attack	sex selection will have troublesome effects on gender disparity.
__label__Attack	not enough girls will be selected by sexist cultures which will result in social strain in future years.

__label__Support	we should legalize sex selection as it is a parents right to choose and many families may want a girl after many boys and so sex selection will help ensure a wanted pregnancy.

__label__Attack	sex selection goes against laws of nature and religion

__label__Support	legalizing medical sex selection can prevent the abortion of unwanted gendered babies
__label__Attack	the existence of the human being on the earth and its adaptation, and ecological domination are only the result of their natural destiny, for which the selection of sex should not be legalized
__label__Attack	if we gave people the right to choose the sex we will have very few females in our world. they most likely would choose a boy. let god be the creator of the child and we should never intervene.
__label__Attack	this could cause imbalance in population, if a generation is selected as mainly male or female
__label__Support	if that's what makes people happy then they should be allowed to do it
__label__Attack	with the $20,000 price tag on something that is not 100% accurate, sex selection is only made available to the wealthy.
__label__Support	sex selection would allow the ability to balance the gender gap, allowing for an even capability to increase the population reproductively.

__label__Position	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
__label__Position	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__Attack	The EU needs its own, united Army but not to fight in a war in Ukraine against a country whose leader is unpredictable and can use nuclear weapons against us.

If you insist on a set of shared EU principles and values that go beyond a mere symbolic declaration, these principles and values must include our real heritage: the Judeo-Christian values that have made Europe great. Traditional family values are first and foremost. All these values must be clearly defined in a legal sense.

__label__Support	Why everything is seen in a sexual nature? Brahmacharya doesn't mean women cannot worship god. Brahmacharya means observing celibacy. It doesn't mean that there shouldn't be female devotees of reproductive age. Narrow-minded people do not understand the difference between devotion and sexual attraction.
__label__Support	Some other temples also ban women, and some temples ban men. If it is the same situation with Sabarimala, people wouldn't have bothered about it. But treating menstruation as impure and banning women of reproductive age is regressive and need to address. Menstruation is just a biological process. Not allowing menstruating women in temples sends a wrong message to people and future generations.
__label__Support	Sabarimala temple is taking funds from government and hence state government has the right to make changes in law for the temple.
__label__Position	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__Support	Transparency is the first key to real democracy. Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings. Or think about all the meetings between diplomats (Coreper) and civil servants (working groups and committees), where ±90% of decisions are made, for the Council to be rubberstamped. Meetings that most citizens don't even know about.
__label__Support	In order to strengthen democracy in the EU, Council meetings should be open to the public and the press. Only in open Council meetings are the Ministers of the Member States forced to clearly state the national interests they can vouch for in relation to their national partners and Voters. Together with the European Parliament, it focuses on an open political debate and decision-making process.
__label__Attack	It would render the meetings useless since they would only be able to express official statements and instead negotiate new ideas without pressure.
__label__Position	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__Position	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy
__label__Support	It shouldn't be the European families who pay for the damage caused by multinational corporations.
__label__Support	Raising prices in the energy sector cannot be the solution in the fight against climate change. The European Commission allows international firms to increase their prices, and as a result, household costs are rising at an incredible rate. The EU should definitely revoke these decisions, and instead of placing the burden on its own citizens, it should instead support them to lead a more sustainable way of life. The green transition should not be a heavy burden borne on the average citizen’s shoulders
__label__Position	Holocaust denial should be a criminal offence
__label__Position	The world does not need religion anymore
__label__Support	As Yuval Noah Harari says “What we need now are morality and spirituality. Morality is about reducing suffering in the world. And spirituality is about questioning and looking for answers. Religions provide us just with answers and no scope of questions.”
__label__Support	Religion has served its purpose of uniting people, setting up structures in society, and developing trust and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are thriving towards objective realities, and religion is an inter-subjective reality and now the only thing it does is create differences in the world, brainwash people, develop animosity for other beliefs, and provide rituals that are just shortcuts to becoming a good person. (A Muslim may pray 5 times a day; a Hindu may pray daily for hours in temples; a Christian may go to church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities).
__label__Support	In the past, every unknown thing dealt with religious beliefs. But now Science & Technology has taken over everything. We know the reasons for drought, earthquakes, windstorms, etc. they are scientific phenomena and not the wrath of gods anymore.
__label__Attack	Due to their technological nature, neo-banks do not need any physical bank branches, which helps them save on overhead costs (the cost of running the business). Thus, neo-banks are able to offer lower fees and higher interest rates on checking and savings accounts to customers.
__label__Support	People don’t trust neo-banks as much because they don’t have a physical presence, which makes them a risk for customers in case of any issues or challenges. In-person customer service may appear more trustworthy to customers.
__label__Support	Tech literacy is still very low in India. Traditional banks can meet the banking requirements of less tech-savvy customers or people in rural areas of the country who prefer face-to-face interaction with the manager.
__label__Support	Commercial banks help to create credit, which leads to increased production, employment, and consumer spending, all of which help to grow the economy.
__label__Attack	Since neo-banks are completely digital, they operate 24 hours a day and their services can be accessed at any time. They are easy to access from anywhere through a smartphone.
__label__Attack	Fintech companies can open specialized neo-banks that target a specific type of customer’s needs. For example, LXME aims to become India’s first Neo bank for women, which will offer product solutions that address women-specific financial needs and emotional preferences.
__label__Position	We should preserve European culture
__label__Position	Organ donation should be made compulsory
__label__Support	Many people are being kidnapped for organs. Illegal human organ trafficking is in almost every country. Some poor people are selling organs. All these things are consequences of organs shortage.
__label__Attack	Not all organ transplantation surgeries are successful. The body of recipient may reject the organ of the donor.
__label__Support	Many people are in need of organ replacement surgeries to survive. There is a shortage of organ donors. Hence compulsory organ donation after death can ensure that no one will die due to the non-availability of healthy organs.
__label__Position	Human Gene editing is a good thing
__label__Position	We should develop Web 3.0.
__label__Position	The EU should also guarantee territorial integrity against threats from Turkey and other Middle Eastern regional powers.
__label__Support	I wholeheartedly agree. Securing our neighbors and allies has to be a priority. The only thing that causes me some dismay is Turkey being a part of NATO. It was a good idea in 1951 but clearly, Turkey must be out off the map now.
__label__Position	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society
__label__Attack	Europe is full and cannot accept more illegal migrants. Those persons must be sent back and have to ask for approval from their state of origin.
__label__Support	Complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.

__label__Support	private military companies are only in the business for profit and not for the "best" for our country in it's interests and private military companies should be banned.
__label__Attack	private military companies offer a unique way of dealing with a problem, one that keeps our actual government out of it.
__label__Support	pmcs should be banned, as they are profiting from war and destruction. it is their interest to cause and prolong discord in the world.
__label__Support	the military should be wholly the domain of governments, because they provide for national defense. a private military company is 100-percent for profit, making them less favorable to true national defense.
__label__Support	private military companies do not operate under the normal rules of engagement and are sometimes linked to civilian deaths
__label__Support	private military companies are in it for the financial gain and does not adhere to the morals of civilian casualties.

__label__Support	private military companies are operated for profit rather than for the defence of nations.
__label__Support	they may sell weapons to countries that would use them inappropriately
__label__Support	we should ban private military companies as they are difficult to legislate and it is difficult to monitor the operations and ensure they are legal and ethical.
__label__Support	we should ban private military companies because they have an unfair monopoly on money and weapons.
__label__Attack	private military companies are needed to provide security when the military can not do the job
__label__Attack	i think that we shouldn't ban private military companies for national security
__label__Attack	private military companies can be useful to countries who do not have their own military.
__label__Support	the do not abide by the same rules and regulations of a government run military and need to be banned.
__label__Support	private military companies only exist to continue and profit from warfare. their operations are immoral and unlawful.

__label__Support	private militaries are a threat to security if they decide to overthrow the government
__label__Attack	private military companies protect assests and officials in war torn areas. they're needed. they don't take money from the tax payers to accomplish their missions and act only defensively.
__label__Support	private military companies allow people with money to hire their own armies to force others to do what they want. military forces should only be allowed at national level.

__label__Attack	we should not ban private military companies because they can provide great protection in many areas of our country
__label__Attack	a lot of private resources are needed for military campaigns, such as weapon manufacture. using a private military company is no different.
__label__Support	only the federal government should be allowed to handle any military training.
__label__Support	military contractors take work away from our own troops, which the government already spends a great deal on.
__label__Support	private military companies only purpose is to make money and as a result they don't focus on protection as much as they should be.
__label__Support	private military companies are largely unregulated, and providing muscle for financial gain fosters corruption and undemocratic process - it is the survival of the powerful over the poor, oppressed.

__label__Position	The EU should strengthen development cooperation.
__label__Support	Europe as a whole is the world’s leading donor. The European Union should strengthen the development cooperation action, focusing on inclusive development
__label__Position	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language
__label__Position	We should subsidize higher education institutions
__label__Support	Indians as a whole consider educational institutions as job machines, we expect to enter unemployed and come out with employment. We don’t realize that we will have to upgrade our skills to become worthy of employment. This is the reason that more than 80% of engineers are unemployable and the figures are even worse for the non-engineers.
__label__Support	Though we have been establishing national-level institutes for the past 40 years, we haven’t been investing to maintain their standards. Funds are needed for quality education. Even the top Indian institutes lack proper infrastructure, labs, resources, etc. And even whatever is available is just for the sake of passing the students in the examination and sitting idle the rest of the time.
__label__Support	Today no problem has a single solution and no new technology is related to a single discipline. We need multiple inputs from multiple disciplines and our institutes have failed in doing so.
__label__Support	Indian students perform brilliantly when they go to different countries in the field of research. It means that we don’t lack talent, we lack infrastructure and a healthy environment for our sharp minds.
__label__Support	We haven’t been paying our teachers on the scale of what their counterparts earn in other countries. As a result, people are reluctant to the idea of teaching as a career. We have also failed to lure successful foreign faculties to our institutes.
__label__Support	The majority of driverless cars are going to be Electric Vehicles (EV's) which will help in decreasing the pollution level in the country, which is also one of the major issues the country is facing.
__label__Attack	Even though driverless cars reduce vehicular accidents caused by human error, there are cases of driverless cars causing accidents.
__label__Support	If driverless cars are allowed in India, they can be used for a variety of other purposes also such as delivery or pickup service, which will also save time and human resources.
__label__Position	Nepotism exists in Bollywood
__label__Support	The standards of Indian cinemas fall at times because of nepotism. Producers and directors are pushing star kids to launch in their movies, failing to judge their acting skills and screen presence. This leads to flop movies and a loss of quality and standards of the Indian cinemas.
__label__Attack	Star kids also have an upbringing which is surrounded by the Bollywood industry. This gives them an advantage of getting adjusted and having a clearer overview of the industry. This might help them learn faster and do better which an outsider might not be able to.
__label__Support	Movie stars of Bollywood often launch their children with much ease in the industry. Such acts serve as the roots of the debate for nepotism. This kind of act has been going on since ages. Hence, nepotism evidently exists in Bollywood.
__label__Position	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy
__label__Support	climate change can only be successfully addressed on a global scale, especially in emerging countries that will be responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions in a few decades otherwise. But to convince them to grow green we have to acknowledge that we are denying them the way to build their economy as we did in the past 200 years. So we must support emerging countries in their transition to a green economy.
__label__Position	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Position	NGO boats should have an government representative on board to make sure they aren't people trafficking
__label__Attack	NGO boats should be forbidden, only Frontex should intervene to bring them home
__label__Position	India should transition to electric vehicles
__label__Support	Maybe while helping economic integration in Africa to happen, we will discover that we could go further in our own EU development. We could foster transnational companies which operate on both continents but not primarily the very big ones. I think of companies that supply solar power solutions to rural areas or microcredit banks. Create platforms where best choice and best practice solutions can evolve. This way, we can establish a single common market.
__label__Support	With highly subsidized agricultural products the EU destroys local markets in African countries. This procedure should be stopped as soon as possible. EU agricultural subsidies should be replaced with incentives and support for a sustainable transition. The earlier we abandon these unfair and highly unsustainable subsidies the better for our own future health, social development, and climate future. Also, this will lead to a better relationship with African Union and enable better livelihoods for African farmers and citizens,
__label__Support	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas. If these young people create for example remote learning opportunities for African students, we should not only sponsor such projects but make exchange possible for young people in Europe to create similar items for example to foster MINT skills throughout Europe. Give more opportunities for young people from both sides to meet, exchange, and ventilate new ideas.
__label__Support	Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.
__label__Support	Discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.

__label__Support	Discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.
__label__Position	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries
__label__Support	taxation seems to be the only real way to incentivize other countries less worried about climate change to work on it
__label__Position	We should end illegal pushbacks!
__label__Position	We should promote mental health
__label__Position	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration
__label__Position	We should tax heavily or refuse to import products not manufactured in the European Union that do not comply with our climate standards
__label__Position	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__Support	Expansion by many dissimilar members and in particular the implementation of the EURO has made the EU unmanageable. The EURO is too strong for the less competitive members and is therefore unsustainable.
__label__Support	Without change, the EU will be following the route of the USSR and other communist countries, who after 70 years of trying to build a social paradise ended in poverty and suppression.
__label__Position	We need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy.
__label__Attack	The intention of helping a country with democratization can easily be used to justify violent actions.
__label__Position	The EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it
__label__Attack	'We most definitely do not need a wider definition of 'gender-based' anything. 'Gender' is a politicized left-wing concept. I certainly encourage wider protection from violence against women and girls. That should most definitely include protection from the violence and coercion young women face from 'trans' activists. We also want nothing to do with 'intersectionality' which is a neo-Marxist concept of overlapping oppressions. No one is being oppressed in Europe.

__label__Support	zoos keep wild animals locked up in areas smaller than they are used to in the wild and it is not natural for them.
__label__Attack	zoos are an excellent way to provide entertainment and togetherness for families. they provide activities that no other venue can provide. they should not be abolished.
__label__Support	zoos constrict wild animals to enclosures not suitable for them purely for enjoyment

__label__Support	zoos are bad for wild animals that need to live free
__label__Attack	zoos are the only places many people will be able to get close and observe exotic animals - anything that serves to enhance humans' empathy and understanding of animals is worthy of support.
__label__Support	zoos should be abolished because it is cruel and inhumane to cage animals.
__label__Support	Animals should not be kept in cages. They should be able to run free.
__label__Attack	Zoos work as educational centers and are not the cause of the extinction of animals, rather they help that this does not happen, that's why we should not abolish zoos
__label__Attack	Zoos offer an easy and cheap way for people to see and learn about animals from all over the world.
__label__Support	Zoos are too often a place of mistreatment and death for wild animals. We should abolish them and move onto other conservation efforts.

__label__Attack	High voter turnout is usually desirable, but it's a symptom, not the root cause. Forcing people to go to the polls doesn't mean they will make more informed choices. Besides, voter turnout is a good metric that tells us where the potential problems of voter disenfranchisement are which is the first step to addressing them.
__label__Position	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__Position	The use of public defenders should be mandatory
__label__Position	We should prohibit women in combat
__label__Position	Germany should start paying reparations share for any damaged countries of Europe up to 100 years after its attack on international society
__label__Attack	Will Russia also pay their share? Will Austria pay for starting WW1 or will it be Serbia? Will Poland and Hungary pay for occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia in 1938/1939? Will France pay for starting napoleonic wars? It is time to forget what happened almost 100 years ago and focus on the future and I say that as a Czech citizen whose country was occupied by Austria, Germany/Poland/Hungary and then by SSSR and all eastern satelite states.

__label__Position	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech
__label__Attack	I have advice on how you can defend against anything on the Internet. Turn it OFF. And one more piece of advice, try to study something about freedom and responsibility, they are not just mere words. Plato, Socrates, Hayek, Borovský, Auberon Herbert, Herbert Spencer, Roger Scruton, Ronald Reagan (speeches), Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson ... There are texts thousands of years old and also recent books ... you can start anywhere you wish ...
__label__Support	Yes, the European Union needs effective policies to combat online hate speech and these need to be regularly updated as technology evolves and to take into account worldwide learning on how to effectively combat online hate speech.
__label__Support	The internet has provided unprecedented opportunities to express and comment on almost anything. But this also brings with it responsibility. Where is the boundary between freedom of expression and speech hate speech, which is no longer tolerated by the law? How can we oppose such acts – such as insults, vulgarism, or threats on social networks? Or can everyone say anything on the internet?
__label__Attack	People's feelings arent all that important. If you have had enough of the Internet, you can always find yourself a hobby.
__label__Position	We should fight racism in the EU
__label__Position	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country.

__label__Position	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world
__label__Support	The European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides. And as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are doing constantly dividing work between member states. As all successes start in your head, perhaps some attention should be allocated to the media. The EU has a clear chance to become one of the major poles of this multipolar world order.
__label__Position	We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.

__label__Position	We should stop mass migration.
__label__Attack	What we are now seeing are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over years the population will have grown to 2,0 billion. That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today. At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear. Not much of a future for the young Europeans.
__label__Support	We do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices. Innovation is failing and the best we can do is defend the status quo and the old people in power.
__label__Support	But also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...
__label__Attack	Nonsense. Mass migration is a crime against humanity. Endorse this idea: No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Attack	The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter. The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality.

__label__Position	We should change corporate accounting rules to include climate change and biodiversity loss
__label__Position	The EU must use its weight as a united global player in trade policy and put an end to foreclosure
__label__Support	For Europe to act outwardly as a unit, we must first look inward. At the psychological level, how can we create a European home market? What does it take, for example, for a resident of Spain to think of Czech printers as a local product? Will it be possible to reach an agreement on Europe's historical events and interpret them to everyone's satisfaction? This process will take some time.

__label__Position	We should invest in integrated photovoltaic (e.g., over agriculturally used land)
__label__Position	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Position	We should make living wages a human right
