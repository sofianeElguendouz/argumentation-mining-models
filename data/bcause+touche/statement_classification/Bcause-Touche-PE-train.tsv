__label__Position	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__Evidence	The EU has some rules on how social security systems are coordinated (Regulation 883/2004/EC). EU rules ensure that the pension rights accrued in each country are added together and paid out by the pension insurance institution of the Member State of affiliation. But the bureaucratic nightmare is probably just as guaranteed. A better solution would be a transparent and digital platform that collects pension entitlements from all EU member states. That way, every citizen would have an overview of his or her pension entitlements at all times, not just until when they are due.
__label__Evidence	I find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice. Just as I can move myself, my family, furniture, car, and bank accounts freely within the EU, I should have the same right to move and merge my pensions into a single unit.

__label__Evidence	judges by definition are supposed to be impartial. having activist judges defeats the purpose
__label__Evidence	the judicial system requires independence, judicial activists undermine this independence and the practice should be limited.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism lets judges give the final verdict based on feelings so they will have the power to let things slide and give people less sentences than they deserve
__label__Evidence	our laws need to evolve with the times we are living in
__label__Evidence	some laws may not be the best, and opinions are needed.
__label__Evidence	we should limit judicial activism since that leads to civil unrest do to the nature of activists.
__label__Evidence	it is helpful for the judiciary to take public action should they wish to do so as it demonstrates that they are human.
__label__Evidence	every judge is trusted to give their own interpretation of the constitution; there is no way to prevent implicit biases from coming up in their decisions.
__label__Evidence	there should be no limits. how are we to move forward in society if we limit the thought process of judges?
__label__Evidence	many laws need to change with the times and a judge is in a better position than our elected officials to accurately and fairly review those laws.
__label__Evidence	we should limit it, laws should not be changed for special circumstances
__label__Evidence	judicial activism provides a limited view of procedure
__label__Evidence	Judicial activism should be limited as there should be enough statutes of law to allow for most situations and fixed punishments are more acceptable than an individuals response to a case.
__label__Evidence	sometimes politics becomes so corrupt and untenable, that the only way to make change in the country is through judicial activism.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism is dangerous in that it allows for personal opinion to possibly get in the way of true justice. personal opinion clouding what is law should not be allowed.
__label__Evidence	judges are to base decisions on the laws of the country not on their personal beliefs. when a judge puts his bias to a case it can change laws and not support the rights of the individual.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism should be limited as judges should stick to their job and not try to grandstand on issues to gain popularity.

__label__Position	There should be a federal Constitution for a European Federation
__label__Evidence	The EU is established on treaties, but treaties have no soul. Only a constitution has a soul, provided it is well designed: from, by, and for the people.
__label__Evidence	People are willing to volunteer change in relation to involuntary inflicted changes, such as technology, economy, and climate. With this in mind, I hope a European Constitution will be long-lasting and help the people. We have to react to the circumstances and start fast.
__label__Position	We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering
__label__Position	We should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools
__label__Evidence	zero telerance policied do not address underlying causes for the behaviour that is causing the issue
__label__Evidence	children need to learn boundaries and consequences for their actions. they learn faster if there is immediate repercussions than if you let them do it over and over again.
__label__Evidence	a zero tolerance policy at school is a good idea because children need to be disciplined as it might cut crime in the future.
__label__Evidence	bullies should not be given second chances. being victim to school bullying is a major risk factor for developing mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.
__label__Evidence	a zero tolerance policy will scare the children into behaving and following the rules.
__label__Evidence	the zero-tolerance policy is not a good thing at all , kids getting punished for their actions and humiliated in front of a audience is really not the great thing to do.
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policies keep schools safer by immediately removing the problem
__label__Evidence	students should be able to state their opinions and by so learn to mature. by punishing at first sign of disobedience we are just have conformity not learning.
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policies are helpful as they stop children misbehaving
__label__Evidence	it is unfair on those being bullied to punish them the same as you punish the bully
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance leaves no room for individual cases where it may do more harm than good
__label__Evidence	as americans we are granted the right of due process. sometimes there are extenuating circumstances that must be taken into account.
__label__Evidence	all schools should adopt a zero-tolerance policy as kids need to know they can not act inappropriately at any given moment when in school.
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance sets a clear and specific guideline for all to adhere to
__label__Evidence	schools already have systems and hierarchies, there is no need to employ further policies.
__label__Evidence	Some violent and extreme behaviours in schools deserve a fierce and sharp reaction.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools because a misunderstanding can cause innocent students to be suspended or expelled
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance must be mandatory in school and is only way to stop negative stuff which happens so often in schools.
__label__Evidence	however these policies can impede the advancement of children from troubled backgrounds or with additional needs. they need a safe place to learn in a positive behaviours in a supportive environment.
__label__Evidence	it makes a school a safe place for children to learn
__label__Evidence	Zero-tolerance policies may seem unfair to the individual but bad and risky behavior at schools spreads faster than wildfire. Sometimes we must make an example of an individual for the greater good.
__label__Evidence	i agree that a zero-tolerance policy in schools is a good idea since it would mean that our children are safer when they go to school.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy gives administrators no leeway if a student commits a less than serious crime.
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt zero tolerance policies because they have not improved school discipline in other districts, only introduced more punishments for students.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy in schools shows children that the schools are not playing around when it comes to punishment
__label__Evidence	we need to keep other kids safe in schools by enforcing a zero-tolerance policy in schools. we can't have drugs or weapons in our schools and give those kids a pass.
__label__Evidence	teaching children to think for themselves and learn based on their own actions is important to their growth. stunting them with zero-tolerance does no one any favors.
__label__Evidence	the brain of a child isn't fully developed and it isn't fair to have such harsh penalties on them
__label__Evidence	i think it is a very appropriate method given the physical and psychological violence that exists in schools today.
__label__Evidence	children will make mistakes, because they are not mature. we have to allow some discretion in the hands of the administrators
__label__Evidence	students are not yet adults, and circumstances are unique for each child.
__label__Evidence	people make mistakes and should be given a second chance. a zero-tolerance policy in school would not teach the student a lesson, it would just rid the school of the problem.
__label__Evidence	each case needs to be reviewed independently and punishments then established.
__label__Evidence	by adopting a zero-tolerance policy in schools we can cut bullying out since those who do it will be removed from the school.
__label__Evidence	we don't need a zero-tolerance policy that punishes students harshly for small things
__label__Evidence	A zero tolerance policy in schools is a very old fashioned theory, and it has failed over and over again.
__label__Evidence	the school is designed to educate not to accept student abuse
__label__Evidence	a zero tolerance policy is unfair for minimal infractions.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools because it could cause kids to be wrongfully punished due to misunderstandings for example protecting themselves against a bully
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy in schools provides a structured and safe environment for children to learn.
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance results in an overly disciplinarian approach, and is unable to distinguish between all the subtle gradations of rule-breaking.
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policies are the only effective system to keep schools safe from the threats of drugs and school shootings
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a zero tolerance because it will keep the children in check.
__label__Evidence	We should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools as children of school age are in a formative state and will learn good lessons for life including what is and isn't allowed in a good society.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy gives no leeway for administrators in cases where the crime may not be so serious.
__label__Evidence	there are always exceptions to everything so zero-tolerance policies are not good because it doesn't allow for any exceptions.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerence is too harsh, children get reprimanded for even the most innocent act.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy within schools will help support a healthy environment where students do not feel threatened due to the differences (or perceived differences).
__label__Evidence	adopting a zero tolerance rule in schools is good for safety.
__label__Evidence	this would show that schools are serious about stamping out bullying and bad behavior. too many people get away with bad things because schools are scared to punish them.
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policies provide a safe space
__label__Evidence	in many cases punishment does not match crime
__label__Evidence	Zero-tolerance policy works- Think of schools three decades ago, when the policy was prevalent. As a result children were obedient and disciplined, as opposed to students' behaviour today, using moderd soft approaches in schools.
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policies ensures pupils know exactly where they are in terms of rules and regulations leaving no room for ambiguity, thus ensuring better behaviour.
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools- children need more tolerance in their lives in order to flourish, and creating a zero-tolerance policy will cause harm and suffering.
__label__Evidence	a zero tolerance policy will lead to safer schools by removing troublemakers immediately
__label__Evidence	we need to remember we are talking about children not criminals, this policy is far too harsh and unnecessary. let children be children.
__label__Evidence	adopting a zero tolerance in schools will help reduce the amount of bullying that happens.
__label__Evidence	the security of child and teachers is esential for all
__label__Evidence	Zero-tolerance policies leave no room for explaining mitigating circumstances, which is both unfair to the individual being punished and also sends a negative message to the school community as a whole.
__label__Evidence	this is the only way to maintain order
__label__Evidence	it is a good measure, since our youth currently lack responsibility and discipline, and with this we favor more that ability
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a zero-tolerance policy to protect all of our children.
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance in schools to avoid further shootings and also to avoid cases of bullying
__label__Evidence	this would ensure everyone got punished if they broke a rule
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance policies remove troublemakers from schools before they become an even larger problem, which improves the learning environment for other students.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools then all the children will more likely behave
__label__Evidence	an effective measure to avoid bullying is to adopt zero tolerance and more severe punishments
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policies have been shown to be disproportionately applied to minority students.
__label__Evidence	there should be some leeway for pupils otherwise they will have no grounding for future life if all they know is what they can't do and cannot question it.
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policies in schools allow for a safer, bully-free environment.
__label__Evidence	We should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools since the current system clearly isn't working and needs a drastic, non tolerant change.
__label__Evidence	children are still growing and forming their own personalities - a zero-tolerance policy allows no room for mistakes, at a time when children are testing boundaries and they need some flexibility to develop
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools because it will scare kids into behaving
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance will improve educational standards and behaviour leading to better learning outcomes.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy in schools is the wrong way to go as it would too often cause innocent students being punished for being pushed too far.
__label__Evidence	a zero tolerance policy in schools would cut down on bullying and fighting.
__label__Evidence	Zero tolerance parties have the appearance of fairness, which increases buy-in to the disciplinary system from otherwise skeptical parents and community leaders.
__label__Evidence	adopting zero-tolerance in school will solve the big issues which schools all around country face it today.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy in school would improve behaviour and thus improve results.
__label__Evidence	being permissive of disruptive behavior is unfair to well-behaved students.
__label__Evidence	students who are suspended will loose out on classes and might fail exams or even drop out of school as a result.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a zero-tolerance policy because it will keep kids disciplined and the schools will be safer
__label__Evidence	we need to have the safest possible learning environment, as this enables students to perform at their best.
__label__Evidence	teachers and children should feel safe in schools and a zero-tolerance policy will be beneficial for all.
__label__Evidence	there is an increase in anti-social behaviour and lack of respect among schoolchildren these days so a zero-tolerance policy will quickly teach them to respect the rule and people in general
__label__Evidence	kids needs their freedom and to learn from mistakes
__label__Evidence	kids in schools are not always mature enough to understand the consequences of their actions. a zero-tolerance policy would just be punishing students that need the most guidance.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy in schools shouldn't be adopted because the smallest little unimportant things could lead to a student being suspended.
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance can punish children unreasonably due to the lack of flexibility where a child could for instance be suspended just for bringing a rubber band into school which could be classed as a weapon.
__label__Evidence	dangerous items should not be allowed in schools because it is endangers the students and faculty and a strict punishment would help prevent these items from being brought.
__label__Evidence	Zero tolerance policies send a strong signal to students, parents, and the community that violence and bullying will not be tolerated.
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policy is too harsh not letting a way for even a minor fault. students are terrorized and are no more comfortable for studying
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt a zero-tolerance policy because it is too restricting and suppressing.
__label__Evidence	it has been shown that children are at a higher risk of dropping out of school if there is a zero-tolerance policy in place
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance policies lead to better outcomes in schools
__label__Evidence	being too harsh creates a negative environment which is bad for children so there should be some flexibility to avoid a zero-tolerance policy in schools.
__label__Evidence	if a zero tolerance policy in schools is adopted, this will impinge on the rights of the pupils to challenge decisions they may deem unfair or unfit.
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance policies don't allow for adminstrators to use their judgement to administer punishment
__label__Evidence	Zero tolerance policies provide a consistent framework for discipline, to ensure that issues are treated with the gravity they deserve.
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policy should be adopted to teach children disciplined and to help prepare them for a life where rules apply.
__label__Evidence	students from schools with active zero tolerance policy have occasionally blurted about how the policy infringes on their rights and how teachers use the policy as an excuse to deal with them.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools because some of the teachers would misuse the policy
__label__Evidence	adopting a zero-tolerance policy helps to combat violence and drug abuse in schools
__label__Position	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people
__label__Evidence	The situation of young people is difficult. Temporary jobs, precarious contracts, civic contracts replacing regular employment, forced self-employment, lack of basic social protection, and even age-discriminatory practices (also on the basis of age) are still the norm for millions of young people who are trying to make their way in the labor market. They need urgent help!
__label__Evidence	I agree. Young people should have a voice in policymaking. Regulation needs to reduce forms of precarious work. It is time to expand collective bargaining coverage to all forms of work. It is essential to introduce a right to decent housing and policies capping rents and limiting property market speculation. we urgently need investment to achieve this. Youth is the future, we have to take care of it.
__label__Evidence	A lot of programs nowadays sound really good on paper, but there always is someone bending the rules. There needs to be outside monitoring in every youth program of that sort
__label__Evidence	We see this problem in many countries and the situation is getting worse - the pandemic, also, took its toll. Stable quality jobs and adequate social protection are necessary if we don't want to see a great strain on social systems in the long term.
__label__Evidence	To prevent precarious conditions, we must put in place quality standards, they must be binding for all jobs created under EU and National recovery plans. Better monitoring and trade union involvement are needed to assess and report youth unemployment and NEET rates. At the moment these numbers hide forced mobility, involuntary part-time employment, and work in a grey and informal economy. Urgent measures are needed to fight youth unemployment and precarious working conditions in sectors where young people are overrepresented (tourism; gig economy...).
__label__Evidence	I agree. Stable, quality jobs and adequate social protection for everyone are necessary. Trade unions have many proposals to achieve more equal and inclusive labor markets. This goes hand in hand with policies to promote more equal, sustainable, and inclusive societies.
__label__Evidence	We cannot afford a lost generation, so we need to invest in quality jobs and young people for our future!
__label__Evidence	The problem of youth employment has been there for a long time but was underlined again during the pandemic. Many young people are forced to move to a different country in order to find work.
__label__Evidence	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.
__label__Evidence	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people. It is embedded in the core principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but those high and lofty principles must become a reality for all workers, old and young!
__label__Position	The European Union should hold a referendum to decide on immigration
__label__Evidence	Absolutely right! If the eurocrats cared about what the people want, they'd ask them.
__label__Position	We do not want illegal migration.
__label__Evidence	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.

__label__Position	Censorship of movies is an outdated concept
__label__Evidence	Through censorship, money power will rule society. It's a fact that rich people influence politics.
__label__Evidence	Filmmakers spend lot of money and time to make movies. If parts of the movie is cut in the name of censorship, they will be discouraged to make more movies.
__label__Evidence	Censorship causes imposition of majoritarian ideals on others.
__label__Position	There should be no illegal migration
__label__Evidence	Entering the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right to receive asylum.
__label__Evidence	We must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.
__label__Evidence	This is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.

__label__Evidence	An EU army independent from NATO and its US commanders is critical to strategic autonomy and avoiding being dragged into destructive US wars in the Middle East like in the past.
__label__Position	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__Position	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities
__label__Evidence	Esperanto is politically neutral: it is not used by any European nation. Although there is some culture connected to the language, there is no political or economic power imposing it. Also, where English is connected to the US, Canada, Australia, and other countries, Esperanto would be a truly European language.
__label__Evidence	To build a common European understanding and to create a European identity, we need our own common language.
__label__Evidence	Esperanto is linguistically neutral: The language was created with the principle of internationality in a European context. It’s democratic: There are no native speakers of Esperanto, or better yet not any monolingual speakers of Esperanto. Everyone has to learn it as a second language. As a result of this nobody will have an advantage over others and nobody can feel like a 'stranger' since nobody can feel like a 'native'. Everyone is respected regardless of their origin and not discouraged from learning the language.
__label__Position	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__Evidence	Norway and Iceland can provide their external point of view toward EU policy at the conference. But why only Norway and Iceland? Why not Switzerland? Why not the recognized candidates? And maybe even UK! I'm sure there are many lessons to learn from their experience in the EU and from the Brexit
__label__Position	We should build a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network
__label__Position	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Evidence	Almost 3 lakh people were employed in the firecracker industry in these places, and 5 lakh people in packaging, transporting, distributing, and selling these crackers. Thus, the ban would also mean huge unemployment in these states.
__label__Evidence	Bursting crackers on Diwali has always been on the to-do list in every family. A Deepavali without firecrackers will definitely be a cut-down in entertainment and recreation for the kids, as well as the elders.
__label__Evidence	Banning firecrackers in some places currently having pollution at its peak like Delhi-NCR will obviously bring down the poisonous emission of gases which has deadly effects on the entire balanced ecosystem. The highest level of particulate matter recorded in Delhi was 2.5 in the year 2016, which indeed made Delhi the most polluted city in the world in terms of air pollution. The “Central Pollution Control Board” also stated that the level of sulfur dioxide in the air gets tremendously high between 9 p.m. till midnight during Deepavali.
__label__Evidence	The crackers regulated in the market comprise chemical components like saltpeter, carbon, and sulfur. When these are ignited altogether, hazardous oxides of gases are emitted which cause suffocation, reduce visibility, and other health hazards. Medical experts state that the air gets contaminated with toxic gases and remains for days after Diwali. The toxic elements that reach the lungs, cannot be removed thereafter and can cause grave health issues. This will cause long-term effects on children.
__label__Evidence	With the ban, religious sentiments get triggered too. In 2017, the Hindu community raised questions about the ban on Christmas trees on Christmas, or slaughter of lamb on Eid, or colors on Holi, etc., thinking it to be against their communal practices.
__label__Evidence	As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.
__label__Position	We should be realistic wrt. migration.
__label__Position	We need to develop a partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__Evidence	Agreed, BUT only on one condition: that every euro be spent under the joint control of local and European officers. There's so much corruption in Africa that otherwise of every 100 euros sent there, at least 80 would end up in the pockets of corrupt officers. And in that case, it's better to not send anything.
__label__Position	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain
__label__Position	We should support agroforestry
__label__Position	We should adopt a single migration policy.

__label__Position	Doctors should be paid based on how many people they successfully treated
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately, in our society, a healthy person is not profitable. Pharma is a big business, doctors are being paid for prescribing drugs. Modern healthcare should be preventive.

__label__Evidence	I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.

__label__Position	We should abolish covid digital pass
__label__Evidence	More illegal and legal migration will lead to more unemployment, lower wages, more insecurity, and less sustainable social systems.
__label__Evidence	Respect for human rights and effort sharing, and solidarity should be common sense in EU member states. Unfortunately, they're not yet.
__label__Evidence	I disagree, each country must be sovereign to establish its migration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.
__label__Evidence	Across the EU, young people are continuing to face a number of significant challenges to enter and get a stable position in the labor market. They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are particularly affected. So we need a fairer migration policy but also consider migrant needs (and challenges) in other policy areas.
__label__Evidence	The shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens. And it is not in line with the fundamental rights the EU is supposed to put into practice.
__label__Evidence	In the EU labor market we will need more workers from outside Europe to continue the level of economic activities we are planning.
__label__Evidence	There is a need for a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not moved an inch since 2019. There have been attempts of making progress in adopting a common European asylum system and forming an EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while also stressing its aim to closely monitor migration routes and maintain situational awareness. This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.
__label__Evidence	The EU should treat economic migrants with more vigilance. They cannot be the solution to the aging European population. We need more focus on border control to curb illegal migration.
__label__Evidence	The human rights-based approach should be the core principle. Legal channels for entry and fostering an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as key tools to address the social impact of migration flows are necessary.
__label__Evidence	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.
__label__Evidence	Although there is an immense increase in the number of TCN migrant workers, there is no adequate policy in protecting their rights. Anyone in Europe should be entitled to the same worker’s rights, no matter where they come from. As migration is an issue that is dealt with by all countries, we must find a common answer at the EU level.
__label__Evidence	The Dublin Agreement leaves EU member states with an external border completely alone to deal with the challenge of immigration. This must stop! Not only because solidarity in the EU is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overburdening of states left alone with this challenge creates intolerable situations for the refugees.
__label__Evidence	Before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have nice conditions in the EU, we should first focus on ensuring that our own people can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.
__label__Evidence	Each country must have the right to choose based on a democratic vote, how many immigrants they want to accept. The question of immigrants depends on each country's reality and culture: this must be managed at the local level.
__label__Evidence	We should not bring the problem to Europe, but we should rather help where it is needed in their region!
__label__Evidence	Giving immigrants more rights will lead to the forced displacement and eventual erasure of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what's happening to the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China is genocide then so is this. This idea proposal is not grassroots, it's astroturfed lies to hide the fact that our migration policies are totally undemocratic and forced onto native Europeans.
__label__Evidence	A fair, sustainable, and open Europe benefits everyone. Our common future demands actions to put human rights, solidarity, and social justice on top of the agenda.
__label__Evidence	The nations must have the final say regarding whom they want to allow to live on their sovereign territories.
__label__Position	We should implement a climate score for products
__label__Position	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens
__label__Position	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__Evidence	And not just the batteries. The EU should have an overall policy with a clear goal to restrict and reduce planned obsolescence.
__label__Evidence	Having to replace an entire mobile phone (or tablet, camera, notebook, etc.) because a battery reached the end of its useful life is infuriating. It is not just a strain on consumers' wallets, it is also devastating for the environment, as the energy and resources going into manufacture of electronics is artificially increased through the short lifespans these devices have.

__label__Evidence	since intellectual property is such covers such a broad spectrum, it is difficult to prove that rights have been infringed leading to lengthy legal cases and should, therefore be abolished.
__label__Evidence	without intellection property rights there is no incentive to research and develop new products
__label__Evidence	we should abolish intellectual property rights because we never can truly know that someone came up with something.
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights are expensive to maintain and hold back the spread of new ideas
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights mean that the people who come up with ideas or products get the financial gains from said product and so makes people more likely to innovate
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights should be abolished as they stifle innovation and allows the creation of monopolies and giant corporations
__label__Evidence	also called intellectual plagiarism none of this makes sense there may be people who think the same and that is not a crime
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights create a monopoly position for a company which enables them to charge whatever they like for a product without fear of competition. it prices the poor out of markets

__label__Evidence	ip rights should be abolished as their original use has long since been abandoned in favor of large organisations abusing their legal powers with them.

__label__Evidence	it gives more people an opportunity to improve a product already on that market without worrying about copyright infringement.

__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights shouldn't be abolished because it helps to ensure the originator is reimbursed accurately for their ideas.

__label__Evidence	Due to the inactive lifestyle and stressful lives, many people are getting lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. Fit India Movement can encourage people to consume healthy food and maintain physical and mental fitness.
__label__Evidence	With high-quality advertisements and marketing practices, junk food manufacturers are manipulating children to buy their foods. This Fit India Movement will make children think about the negative consequences of junk food. As a result, this movement will encourage children to consume healthy food.
__label__Evidence	Some parents put too much stress on children to study. They send their children to tuition after school or just make them sit to do homework forgetting the importance of free time to play.

__label__Evidence	This movement has the potential to make more people embrace traditional Indian martial art forms like Kathi Samu, Musti Yudha, etc, and traditional dance forms and also healthy Indian snacks. And as a byproduct, this may result in creating some jobs.
__label__Evidence	The motivation to maintain fitness should start from childhood. But in India, many schools lack playgrounds. Lack of playgrounds may push children to turn to inactive lifestyles.
__label__Evidence	‘Fit India Movement’ may not reach the people of below poverty line. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, both physical activity and nutritious food are necessary. But in India, still many people are malnourished and some people do not have access to safe drinking water. So, without solving the issue of poverty and lack of access to affordable nutritious food, a section of people in India will not be able to take advantage of this movement.
__label__Evidence	Some people are already focusing on fitness. We can observe this with the increasing number of fitness startups. But that is a small proportion of people. Generally, many people want to maintain an active lifestyle, but all they need is some encouragement. So, this movement constantly reminds people to focus on fitness goals just like Swachh Bharat reminds us of the importance of keeping our surroundings clean.
__label__Evidence	We haven't got enough jobs and money for everyone in Europe! Stop immigration! However, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia have it! These countries can therefore welcome migrants instead of funding hundreds of mosques in Europe!
__label__Evidence	Why do we even let in migrants who do not speak the language of the country where they wish to reside? Migration is bad for the nations and degrading for the migrants. We must work to end mass migration.
__label__Evidence	Indigenous Europeans have no obligation to take in any more migrants, and neither do they want to. This is being forced on us.
__label__Evidence	It's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).
__label__Evidence	Each migrant in the European Union must be given the possibility to integrate even if the refugee status is not clear. Integration programs could support this development in all cases.
__label__Evidence	No, Europe is not a colony. Immigration has been devastating. Public EU officials who support immigration should be named and the European people must be given a democratic opportunity to remove them from positions of power and influence.
__label__Evidence	We have millions of poor true Europeans that we can help, why help migrant who have nothing in common with us?
__label__Evidence	Most of the time migrants have trouble fitting into society because of the language barrier and hate. Providing them with language lessons could reduce the tensions around migration, and improve the migrants' integration.
__label__Evidence	Knowledge of the host country's language is essential for integration. When migrants understand the local language, studies show that their values tend towards those of the host countries over time.
__label__Evidence	It is essential that European principles and values are taught to migrants, including an explanation of the reasoning behind these principles and values. It would be best that this is provided both in the person's mother tongue and in the language of the host country.
__label__Evidence	For more than 50 years immigration has been going on uncontrolled and unchecked. No changes need to be made before we have an agreement that people ignoring our immigration laws should be detained in repatriation facilities with no chance of re-entering the EU. Once we agree on that we can start talking about funds and resources for those who do deserve help.
__label__Evidence	Working in sectors in ample need of workers, such as the agricultural fields, will help to integrate immigrants once their situation has been legalized. And above all, education is needed, an intensive integration education both in the language (of course) and also culture: history, philosophy, literature, etc.
__label__Evidence	Europe needs more women to have children and raise them in a good manner, which helps transmit our culture: our culture is a praise to the world and must be saved from globalization invasion and destruction.
__label__Position	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good
__label__Evidence	The huge data we produce every day is analyzed and fed into our devices through algorithms that we end up giving more and more control of our lives to the gadgets. We may feel that we receive all these services for free, but they come at the cost of our precious time and attention.
__label__Evidence	With all the data and algorithms our apps and gadgets, without our conscious knowledge, are making decisions for us. Decision-making is (was) one of the qualities that made humans different from others
__label__Evidence	After a daily 10-hour shift from Monday to Friday most of us prefer to stay at home on the holidays. We surround ourselves with laptops, TV, and mobile and use them in cycles for Netflix, sports, social media, etc. (thinking that we are relaxing) rather than going out. We prefer and are more comfortable with online chatting instead of talking to people for real. There are fewer meaningful relationships nowadays because of all the above factors. We have started preferring isolation.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear technology is a very efficient alternative to non-renewable energy resources. But still, we chose to move ahead with more and more types of nuclear warheads. The same is the case with almost every other invention. Similarly, though initially, AI promised better lives for us, because of AI, we have started losing our basic human qualities.
__label__Evidence	We have started losing our basic human habits and instincts, and are actually governed by devices and apps.

__label__Evidence	too many students have defaulted on loans or are paying them for many years. by subsidizing these students we can assist in stopping this.

__label__Evidence	Students are and will always be the backbone of the society. It's compulsory to support these growing students in becoming true, well educated citizens to support the economy.
__label__Evidence	students that work hard to get a degree should not start out their journey into the real world, in debt
__label__Evidence	it isn't the obligation of any tax payer to give money to help someone else get an education. that is a personal choice, and if they want to go to college they need to pay for it on their own.
__label__Evidence	student loans is a type of aid that is given to them in order to help lower their expenses and debts
__label__Evidence	student loans should be subsidized so that more kids can go to school, get a better education and contribute to the advancement of society.
__label__Evidence	we should invest in the young generations and support them in their education, especially when higher education is so expensive.
__label__Evidence	subsidised student loans would encourage everyone to go to university if they thought they wouldn't have any debt at the end of the studies.
__label__Evidence	there are more important ways we should be using public money, such as housing and healthcare.
__label__Evidence	students loans should not be subsidized as it is a students choosing to continue to go to school on their own accord and whim, not a requirement to be the burden of others.
__label__Evidence	we should not pay for other peoples life style choices
__label__Evidence	in the interests of raising the education level of our population we should subsidize student loans.
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize student loans because students should have worked to pay for college instead of going into debt.
__label__Evidence	student loans should not be subsidized as the enhanced education they receive will allow the students to go on to better paying jobs.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing student loans will enable many more people the opportunity to attend college
__label__Evidence	there are better things the government can do with that money.
__label__Evidence	providing help in paying student loans will lift a financial burden off of students and allow them to become more indepedent.
__label__Evidence	Student loans are necessary to be able to afford the cost of college. Subsidizing the loans allows more people to gt a degree and not have to leave to earn an income before they finish.
__label__Evidence	Able students are afraid to continue education due to the prohibitive cost of loans, these students could be the answer to curing cancer etc. We need to ensure no one misses out because of cost.
__label__Evidence	tax payers, many of which have not been to school themselves, should not have to pay for any elses student loans.
__label__Evidence	education is important to ensure the continued progress of humanity and to move humanity forwards; for this reason we should subsidise loans for students.
__label__Evidence	It is difficult to get a job without a degree these days, so students need help paying to obtain one.
__label__Evidence	we should help students pay to be educated. it is costly, and loans hamper their future.
__label__Evidence	student loans is a help for those who do not have resources
__label__Evidence	the tax payers would have to pay for the subsidization of student loans in the end, it would be better to reform the entire university system instead.
__label__Evidence	we need an educated workforce so the loan rate students take should be low and subsidised to get this workforce.
__label__Evidence	by subsidizing student loans we can remove one of the stressors from continuing education.
__label__Evidence	Student loan costs are becoming outrageous putting people in debt for life.
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize student loans because people need to work hard to get their education
__label__Evidence	if we subsidize student loans we could create parasites that never get a degree just to maintain the state subsidy
__label__Evidence	it is important that student loans are granted, because it helps you increase your quality of life and your economic potential
__label__Evidence	the cost of an education is unaffordable for those who might most benefit from it
__label__Evidence	higher education should be a right; subsidized student loans provides all who want to learn with access to an education
__label__Evidence	subsidizing student loans would allow those who previously could not afford to go to university, the opportunity to better themselves with good qualifications.
__label__Evidence	Student loans are fundamentally a commercial transaction and have no place being subsidized.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing student loans lets the students work in their classes not at jobs to pay for their education
__label__Evidence	students should pay for their own education; it isn't fair that everyone has to pay for education through tax regardless of whether they use it.
__label__Evidence	student loans can be expensive and put young people in debt
__label__Evidence	the new generations need the opportunity to advance in their preparation, that is why if they do not have the means and the state does not provide free education then it should promote means such as loans.
__label__Evidence	student loans take many years to pay off and if we don't subsidize there will be less students willing to go to college.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize students loans so that more kids can get a better education, they are the future after all and we will need doctors, engineers, scientists, etc.
__label__Evidence	student loan debt is an enormous pressure on working people, and should be subsidized.
__label__Evidence	graduates earn more over a lifetime than their peers, this gives them plenty of opportunity to repay their debts.
__label__Evidence	for some students taking a student loan is the only way to afford studying
__label__Evidence	students need help with the burden of college costs and shouldn't have to go into crippling debt to get an education.
__label__Evidence	the public should not pay for other peoples lifestyle choices
__label__Evidence	people choose to go to college. those that do should pay the bills for that schooling. we should not be taxed to give money to those that choose to borrow it.
__label__Evidence	it isn't the obligation of anyone to assist students with the costs of their education. if a student wants to get an education they have to realize it comes at a cost and won't be given for free.
__label__Evidence	All young people whether rich or poor should have the opportunity to better their lives by going to into higher education, the more student loans are subsidized the closer this will become a reality.
__label__Evidence	subsidized student loans allow for those from pooer backgrounds to achieve a good standard of education and progress in their lives
__label__Evidence	most people can't afford to go to college, and we don't want them to graduate with massive debts
__label__Evidence	if people want to go to college, they need to work hard and earn enough to go
__label__Evidence	we need to make it more accessible for the public to acquire education, as opposed to adding more barriers such as extreme student debt.
__label__Evidence	graduates should not have to start their career with a massive debt to pay off
__label__Evidence	helping younger generations is obligatory for us and helping them we helping our future.
__label__Evidence	student loans are a massive burden for people getting the degrees necessary to qualify for a job to become a productive member of society.
__label__Evidence	the national debt is out of control and we cannot afford to add to it further.
__label__Evidence	student loans should be subsidized because no human being should start their adult life off with thousands of dollars in debt, it's not fair
__label__Evidence	a student does not have the resources to pay for the high cost of college
__label__Evidence	wider availability of student loans creates a glut of over-educated, under-employed individuals contributing less to society - money would be better investing in vocational education.
__label__Evidence	we should not because it would cost the country millions of pounds and raise everyone's taxes, so the cost of living would go up.
__label__Evidence	student loans shouldn't be subsidized because you're limited in the amount that you can borrow
__label__Evidence	student loans should be subsidized to allow thos students from poorer backgrounds to get a good education and improve themselves
__label__Evidence	students are graduating with huge college loans that make it difficult for them to get started when they leave school.
__label__Evidence	people knew when they took out the loan that they'd have to pay it back. they should be responsible, just as other people are for mortgages and car loans.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing student loans would encourage those with less money to stay on in education rather than leaving for lower paying jobs.
__label__Evidence	student loans are a good deal for students, student loans allow for some students go to school that may have not been able to go to school before
__label__Evidence	better education is good for the nation
__label__Evidence	student loan debt is crippling our young people's ability to fully participate in the economy
__label__Evidence	student loans are so unreasonibly expensive we need to help students with them.
__label__Evidence	college is not affordable anymore. an education can cost more than a home. paying money to some student loan bills allow graduates to prosper, buying homes and cars and supporting the economy.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize student loans because it can help them manage future finances
__label__Evidence	student loans should not be subsidized just because people chose to go to colleges that we beyond their means.
__label__Evidence	no need to subsidize student loans, people can access education by using their own money and time
__label__Evidence	due to the obligations of the students it is sometimes difficult to get a job, we must help them pay their loans so that they do not leave school
__label__Evidence	higher education is not an inherent right. if someone wants to go to college, they should pay for it. the burden shouldn't simply be put on taxpayers instead.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing student loans would allow access to funds above the means of the student and the financial consequences in the future, including higher interest rates would be financially detrimental.
__label__Evidence	There has to be better funding for research, but it should not be administered top-down. Let researchers decide rather than politicians. Do not stifle research by bureaucracy. At the time being, with large consortia getting multi-million euro grants, the application process has become too complicated for most researchers. Rather invest in reproducible, transparent, open research.
__label__Position	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Position	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council
__label__Evidence	The idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy.
__label__Evidence	It should be the common goal of EU diplomacy to change the workings of the UN as it is. The security council is a relict of the emerging post-WW2 order and the influence of the Cold War.
__label__Position	Homeschooling should be banned
__label__Position	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.
__label__Position	We should have psychological counseling in educational institutions
__label__Evidence	In general, a few teachers punish students, who are not scoring well in exams but they do not even try to understand whether they have any learning disabilities. This causes self-esteem issues in students. Psychologists can detect these learning disabilities and can detect these issues and can collaborate with teachers to draft teaching strategies that are suitable for students with learning disabilities.
__label__Evidence	Many students struggle with several issues such as anxiety, self-esteem issues, trouble forming friendships, etc. Guidance and support are very important to help them overcome these problems. So, educational institutions should have mental health professionals to help students.
__label__Evidence	In 2020, on average 34 students committed suicide every day due to several reasons such as exam pressure, and relationship issues. So, it is very important to provide support for them in educational institutions. Counselors can help them to cope with the pressures and can help in improving their mental health. If the student suffers from mental health issues such as severe depression, counselors will take steps to get them treated by psychiatrists.
__label__Evidence	The covid pandemic affected the mental health of many people. As schools and colleges were shut down for a long time, many students felt isolated and that caused an even more negative impact on mental health. As schools and colleges have reopened, students need help to adapt to the new normal.
__label__Evidence	Some students do not even understand what they are going through, they may not even know how to ask for help. Having a counselor at their educational institution will help them a lot in understanding their issues. Moreover, they will learn how to ask for advice and help.
__label__Position	There should be a better post-Brexit European Alliance
__label__Evidence	The EU and its member states have already various partnership or neighborhood programs for Non-EU states.
__label__Position	The EU should be involved in the creation of a media-funding framework
__label__Evidence	In other words, EU (taxpayer)-sponsored propaganda.
__label__Position	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__Position	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection
__label__Position	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__Evidence	The British voted to leave the EU therefore all British have the same obligations as immigrants from non-EU countries.
__label__Evidence	The British people voted for Brexit, so now naturally they have to live with their choice. It turns out you can't actually have your cake and eat it too.
__label__Evidence	I think this is a good idea, but unfortunately it's framed as a British/brexit issue. However, the wider concept of a common EU visa / migration system is a compelling one. Harmonising the system to a common visa regime offers many advantages.
__label__Evidence	British people are not better than anyone else and do not deserve special treatment from the EU. The British people will face the consequences of their decision to leave the EU and it is not the EU's responsibility to make Brexit painless. The benefits of membership cannot be bestowed upon citizens of countries outside the EU/EEA, like the UK.
__label__Evidence	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.
__label__Position	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme
__label__Evidence	Variable pay definitely increases the productivity of employees. High-performing individuals feel well-compensated and rewarded for their efforts, while the under-performing ones also feel motivated to improve.
__label__Evidence	In variable pay schemes, the employees feel content and motivated with their work. They feel that they are an active part of the organization, the organization recognizes them as a part of its growth and values their efforts.
__label__Evidence	Variable pay helps in retaining valuable employees. This helps in retaining good talent for long periods of time and thereby, less spending on hiring new talents. This provides stability to the organization.
__label__Evidence	It has been seen that it is difficult to retain employees in lean times when they are on variable pay schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when business is good, but they do poorly when business is bad. In times of slow business, even top salespeople might have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent living. If the market is slow and commissioned workers can’t earn enough, they may look for other employment opportunities. In lean times, fixed wages can be more effective at keeping employees from leaving for other opportunities.
__label__Evidence	Variable pay can lead to unhealthy competition between employees. They become less willing to help each other. Team co-operation may get affected negatively. In the long run, relations among colleagues may turn bitter. Whereas, in fixed pay schemes, the employees are able to maintain cordial relationships in the office.
__label__Evidence	Mostly, sales jobs have a variable component. This might negatively impact the employee’s attitude towards customers. They may force the customers irrationally just to make profits for themselves. They might overstate the price to the customers just to make more profit. Whereas, an employee with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relations with the customers, striking the right balance in their approach.

__label__Evidence	factory farming is a great way to get more food for everyone
__label__Evidence	Factory farming should be banned as it is an unhealthy and uncaring atmosphere in which to raise animals and doesn't result in a good quality product at the end.
__label__Evidence	for many, eating factory farmed food, is the only way they can afford to eat meat so to ban it would limit the food types poorer people could eat.
__label__Evidence	let the free market decide whether or not we should allow factory farming
__label__Evidence	factory farming is a way of producing cheap meat. without it poorer people may not be able to afford it and may become malnourished.

__label__Evidence	factory farming is cruel to the animals that are forced into a much smaller space than they would have in nature. therefore it should be banned.
__label__Evidence	Raising animals take a lot of land and resources while demand for meat on the market is still steady and important. This is the best way to raise animals by reducing space used and better taking care of animals
__label__Evidence	industrial farms are harmful for the fertilizers they use and create artificial foods dangerous to our health
__label__Evidence	factory farming provides us with all the food we take for granted
__label__Evidence	factory farming is the only way to meet the high demand for meat.
__label__Evidence	it's unethical on the animals and just down right cruel

__label__Evidence	we should ban factory farming as its cruel and inhumane to animals
__label__Evidence	factory farming allows for increased food production for the increasing human population.
__label__Evidence	Factory farming allows us to fill a high demand.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is one way to ensure we have enough food for our citizen and it should not be banned.
__label__Evidence	factory farming should be banned because meat quality goes down when animals aren't living in optimal conditions and therefore people are having to eat inferior meat.
__label__Evidence	factory farming treats live animals as a disposable item
__label__Evidence	we should ban factory farming as animals are kept in cramped conditions.
__label__Evidence	factory farming conditions are usually horrible, with animals treated badly and disease running rampant
__label__Evidence	factory farming takes away jobs from people who know no other work.
__label__Evidence	we should ban factory farming because it is cruel to animals and the quality is questionable at best.
__label__Evidence	Factory farming is unethical and produces meat that is not healthy for anyone to eat.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is an efficient way to produce cheap food for the masses.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is a cost effective method of food production which allows everyone to access expensive foods at a better price
__label__Evidence	we cannot ban things just because you don't like them. factory farms help get the most food per acre.
__label__Evidence	factory farming provides a faster mass production of food and gives us a way to feed more people than we would if we banned it. there will be less hunger in the world so we shouldn't ban it.
__label__Evidence	we should ban factory farming as it poses a huge health risk by passing on diseases and bacteria to people.
__label__Evidence	factory farming provides negative outcomes across several areas, the most important of which is personal livelihood, so it should be banned.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is necessary to sustain the current population level and is needed in order to make farming profitable at this time in history.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is necessary and cannot be abandoned, because it's the way we will always produce things in agricolture
__label__Evidence	factory farms produce a lot of pollution
__label__Evidence	The population is growing ever larger and we need efficient ways to produce enough meat for it.
__label__Evidence	many factory farm workers have contracted diseases due to the conditions in which they work.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban this because it is a way to get cheap, affordable food for people that may not of otherwise been able to afford it and feed their family.
__label__Evidence	factory agriculture lowers the costs of the products and ensures its production throughout the year
__label__Evidence	factory farming should be banned because it increases the risk of animal cruelty
__label__Evidence	factory farming is needed in our times in order to provide ample food for everyone
__label__Evidence	we should not ban factory farming because it gives us another source of food.
__label__Evidence	this is a horrible way to treat animals. they should not be caged in tiny areas, unable to move. this is cruel.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is an efficient way of providing affordable for for people. without it the price of meat will escalate and will be beyond the pocket of many people.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is a cruel, inhumane practice that is tainting our food sources.

__label__Evidence	factory farming concentrates animals in a constricted area, allowing diseases to run rampant through the livestock
__label__Evidence	Factory agriculture can cause disasters in the economy and cause unfair competition with farmers
__label__Evidence	the end does not justify the means, the factory farming is cruel, inhuman and immoral, you. you can argue what you want, but that does not erase the facts.
__label__Evidence	humans need food and this is simply another way to cultivate it. at the end of the day these animals are going to be food no matter what, so the way they get there is of little interest.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban factory farming as it is the most efficient method of farming to produce enough food for the population.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is much more efficient and takes up much less space. should we switch, large amounts of habitat would have to be destroyed to accommodate. this would also increase the prices of meat.

__label__Position	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__Position	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__Position	We should ban NFTs
__label__Position	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__Evidence	Yes, and it should be payed out to every citizen of the EU. Those people with a lower CO2 footprint - typically lower income family - would greatly benefit from it and be incentivized to invest in cleaner energy, heating etc.
__label__Evidence	Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.
__label__Evidence	Most experts agree that an EU-wide carbon tax would be an efficient way to curb our CO2 emissions.
__label__Evidence	In my point of view it will be essential to impose some compensatory levies on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage.
__label__Evidence	Eventually, the best solution would be a world wide agreement (as within OECD and like minded) such as the global minimum tax rate.
__label__Position	United in diversity should be a concept for reconciliation in the Western Balkans.
__label__Evidence	I believe the EU should expedite the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans, to help them evolve and facilitate the reconciliation problems. As you say, Montenegro for instance is a peaceful country that has made efforts to overcome past troubles, and that too should be acknowledged.
__label__Evidence	If we want to uphold to our standards and what the EU represents, we shall help those immigrants and give them the tools to help us make our homes better and multicultural so when the chance is presented they can then have a way to help their countries. Simply blocking them out of our region and neglecting them won't solve anything. We will only make unnecessary enemies.
__label__Position	We should not have illegal immigrants!
__label__Position	We should ban domestic air traffic
__label__Position	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will take away the jobs of thousands of people around the world by removing the function of drivers.
__label__Evidence	the use of autonomous cars should result in a substantial reduction in road traffic accidents which currently are largely a result of human error.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are prohibitively expensive
__label__Evidence	they can cause accidents if the equipment fails.
__label__Evidence	the number of fatalities that can be prevented with autonomous cars makes the development a moral imperative.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars offer the opportunity for people to spend more time on the things they enjoy doing during their commute rather than having to concentrate.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can make trips more relaxing and help the traveler arrive refreshed and happy. it can also eliminate road rage.
__label__Evidence	they can be more dangerous than human drivers
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars would help people who are disabled be able to have their own transportation.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will reduce the human margin of error to near zero and make for a safer commute.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will allow people to do more instead of wasting time in traffic
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can be hacked and become a dangerous weapon for evil persons
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars leave both passengers and pedestrians vulnerable to malicious hacking which could cause wide scale destruction.
__label__Evidence	we should not stop the development of autonomous cars because it will help the people more easily on driving and will provide more safety.
__label__Evidence	stop the development of autonomous cars because it can cause accidents due to the laws in different countries being different
__label__Evidence	it is just another way for lazy people to do as little as possible.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars reduce the risk of human error, thus leading to safer roads.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can help transport those unable to drive themselves
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars could help people make better use of their time
__label__Evidence	The development of autonomous cars should be halted until we have dealt with the moral question of who would be liable in the case of an accident, hacking or malfunction.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can give many people the freedom to drive without actually driving, so we should not stop making them.
__label__Evidence	development of autonomous car will make traffic and parking easier
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars have already caused multiple fatalities and are being used on public roads right now without being adequately tested. the makers are literally using human lives to beta test their products.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars could prevent traffic jams and accidents.
__label__Evidence	developing autonomous cars is a necessity. it would make roads and travel much safer as car accidents account for an incredible amount of deaths. there would be no more drunk and distracted driving accidents.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will provide a way for people who are blind or handicapped a way to travel
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are our future and provide many benefits
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can assist the disabled, or those with limited abilities to get about
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are a danger to everyone on the roads they can not react the way a human driver can.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars strip drivers of the ability to drive as they please
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are so valuable for the future in an ever more congested world so we need to invest more in them.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars allow those with disabilities that hinder driving to be able to travel to appointments, shopping and social events, and not to live isolated from others.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars would help the elderly.
__label__Evidence	Autonomous cars have caused deadly accidents and they will never be safe enough for widespread public use.
__label__Evidence	we should stop the development of autonomous cars because they are too dangerous and unreliable until further safety measures and advancements have been made.
__label__Evidence	the cars can be dangerous and cause accidents if the equipment fails.
__label__Evidence	people that can not drive will be able to go wherever they want.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are the future and some cities already have them.
__label__Evidence	we should not because it will cause much less accidents on the road.
__label__Evidence	Autonomous car development should be continued to help find safe, renewable energy sourced transportation for the masses.
__label__Evidence	they are environmentally friendly and can help minimize traffic congestion.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can have benefits such as allowing anyone to travel inside a car such as disabled and vulnerable people who others would not be able to get to other places.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will never become reality. we need to stop wasting money on this and instead work towards better safety and technology in regular cars.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can be dangerous and promote reckless behavior, so they should discontinue making them.
__label__Evidence	it is a waste of resources. we should develop more environmental friendly cars instead.
__label__Evidence	we should stop the development of autonomous cars because autonomous cars are bad idea, very dangerous
__label__Evidence	they will lead to more deaths on the roads
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are a step too far in automation. to rely on automation on the roads with so many unpredictable events that could take place is taking it too far.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are simply the next logical step in transportation. years ago people would have said all cars are dangerous and we should all stick to horse and buggy instead.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars lack moral judgement.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars could increase accidents
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are dangerous because they are operated by a computer which can malfunction or be hacked.
__label__Evidence	taxis are already available for people that want to be driven so autonomous cars aren't necessary.
__label__Evidence	no autonomous car will every be able to make complex judgement calls the way a human can.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can help those without the capability of driving be able to have consistent transportation when they don't otherwise.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars could easily cause an accident or result in death if there is a system malfunction.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will destroy millions of jobs of truck and taxi drivers.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars should not be produced as they are dangerous and risky.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are not road worthy will cause more accidents due to the cars programing unable to anticipate human decisions
__label__Evidence	these cars are too unpredictable and unsafe
__label__Evidence	globally, over 1 million people die a year in car crashes. to be able to have self driving safe cars that save that many lives a year would be outstanding. robots and self driving cars are the future.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars rely on computer software, so like any computer controlled device, they are susceptible to being hacked
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are computerized and are open to hacking. at that point they can become a dangerous weapon to not only the driver but everyone around him.
__label__Evidence	people need the freedom to drive where they want by themselves.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can make driving more dangerous since their programming can not cover every conceivable instance.

__label__Position	The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees
__label__Evidence	The EU should attract the world's most talented and most entrepreneurial.

__label__Position	NEET exam should be banned
__label__Evidence	NEET exam standardizes the entrance criterion for medical education across the country. As a high score is required to get into government medical colleges, the exam ensures meritocracy.
__label__Evidence	But every year, less than 20% of the students are passing the exam. By this, it is evident that the quality of medical education in other countries where Indian students are studying is not at par with the medical education in India. So, it is very important to take steps to provide affordable and high-quality medical education in India.
__label__Evidence	As the exam requires additional study, coaching centers are taking advantage of the situation and are charging lakhs of rupees for the coaching for the NEET exam. So, due to this, students who cannot afford the coaching are at a disadvantage.
__label__Evidence	Students work hard to score well in class 12 exams, but all that hard work is not recognized. And only the NEET score is considered for entry into medical college, which is very unfair. Moreover, the NEET exam is mainly based on the CBSE curriculum. So, state board students have to study additional things to get a good score on the exam.
__label__Evidence	A high score in the NEET exam is required to get admission to government medical colleges in India. It costs approximately Rs.1.25 crores to study in private medical colleges in India. So, many students are forced to go to other countries such as China, Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, etc. to pursue medical education. In those countries, medical education costs around Rs.35 lakhs. Moreover, they allow students with low NEET scores, but above cut-off marks.

__label__Position	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.
__label__Evidence	The standardized retirement age would not only be fairer in an open market, but it would also (and even more so in the future) prevent any complexities with being paid their retirement for those who have made their contributions in different Member States throughout their lives. Even though there is to be at least a central system for this (a step in the right direction), one will only receive a share of one's retirement from a particular Member State once one reaches the retirement age of that Member State.
__label__Evidence	Retirement is often funded by taxes and taxes are decided by each member state. So each member state should also be the one who decides how those taxes are spent. For some countries, a retirement age of 65 may be unaffordable or undesirable, while for others it may not.

__label__Evidence	The EU needs a humane, civilized, and legal way to manage migration, whether it is for economic reasons or to seek international protection.
__label__Position	European citizens want quality of life and are not interested in world supremacy
__label__Evidence	I have never heard anyone talking in Europe about world supremacy. So it seems kind of pointless that this is a goal of EU policy.
__label__Evidence	Ensure equal opportunities for girls and women, provide them sufficient maternity leave, and institute guarantees that will protect women's careers who choose to have children. Those are the steps we need, and most EU countries already have them (not that they cannot be improved). There's absolutely no need for quotas.
__label__Evidence	All wrong. Let everyone decide for himself (or herself). Forcing women into specific positions is bad ... and sexist I guess.
__label__Evidence	Quotas are always disgusting examples of oppression and evil. I don't want anything of that, I want freedom and free choice.
__label__Evidence	If you want something like 'increasing the percentage of women in all sectors', you need to create more women or reduce the number of men. I will better not ask questions in this direction.
__label__Evidence	Every harpy screams 'more (black) women in power' until Candace Owens appears. Clever, charming black woman, but she is too clever, pro-freedom, and conservative, and that is the problem. So it isn't about women, it's mere greed and desire for power and influence.

__label__Evidence	sustainable and animal-friendly farms grow their own feed and create an ecological cycle.
__label__Evidence	The current subsidies with a modular system of incentives should be replaced, as that empowers farmers to choose environmentally, socially, and financially responsible and sustainable solutions that are already available - like natural sequence farming, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, etc.
__label__Evidence	In Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal feed. In determining how much subsidy a holding receives, the area of the holding is decisive. In other words, a lot of land, a large amount of subsidy. This results in cheap animal feed and, ultimately, intensive livestock farming. Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.

__label__Evidence	an austerity regime would be good for the economy

__label__Evidence	an austerity regime would be harmful
__label__Evidence	The free market knows best how to get out of a recession. Any government involvment would worsen the economic situation.
__label__Evidence	we should not allow an austerity regime because it will completely destroy the country by causing worse economic demise.
__label__Evidence	it's about getting the deficit down and engaging in austerity regime, the overall impact on the economy is positive in the short term
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime has never been shown to work because there is always someone who insists that his project must be funded

__label__Evidence	The European Parliament has developed avenues for a common foreign and defense policy and should exercise its role this way. Also, there are prerogatives of a parliament to guide and control the external policies of the EU.
__label__Position	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Position	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.
__label__Position	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Evidence	I am all for the creation of a European army, but for that, the question of the command of this army must also be resolved. And this is where the idea of a European Security Council is very interesting and deserves to be pushed.
__label__Evidence	I am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction. So NGOs and development cooperation must be involved. An army that can fight must also be able to build. We therefore also need a civilian army in Europe. I would also like an army consisting of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army. Please also take into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objection, also as in the German army.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely right. Europe needs an army for continental defense. Conscription must be introduced at the European level. The army must have the most modern weapons to deter Russia, Turkey, and China.
__label__Evidence	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.
__label__Evidence	I agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.
__label__Evidence	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.
__label__Evidence	On the one hand, we have Russia killing countless Ukrainians and committing sabotage in Britain and the Czech Republic, and on the other hand, we have reluctant United States that is switching between isolationist and interventionist policies every 4-8 years. I stand convinced, that in order for the European Union to move forward, it must begin to introduce measures for the security of both, the current member states as well as the future member states that are endangered due to foreign aggression and bring the responsibility of continental safety firmly in our own hands. If Europe is to find the peace it must have the means to create peace by being able to protect itself against hostile foreign influences.
__label__Evidence	The EU cannot endlessly lean on America or NATO. America has proven to be fickle and NATO has its own problems, such as Turkey, which is outside the EU and has threatened Greece. The EU needs its own independent solution.
__label__Position	We should limit executive compensation
__label__Evidence	executives deserve the money as they do a stressful and demanding job leading large organizations that hire large number of people.

__label__Evidence	executive compensation should be limited because it is not fair that a ceo should not make that much more than the regular workers in a company.
__label__Evidence	without executive compensation talent will be lost to other countries
__label__Evidence	executives that award their own salaries have shown they can not show restraint
__label__Evidence	the executives already earn enough money to give more incentives, those incentives have to go to steps below where they are necessary
__label__Evidence	workers would be more motivated to do a good job if they were compensated more instead of giving the executives so much

__label__Evidence	executives who run huge profitable companies that employ many people should be highly compensated for doing so
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't limit executive compensation. the whole point of becoming an executive is working up the ladder for years in order to receive the six figure salary and lucrative bonuses.

__label__Evidence	by providing a high compensation to the executives of a company you can get a higher quality employee and the business will make more money. therefore we should not limit their pay.
__label__Evidence	there should not be a limit to executive compensation, they deserve to be compensated based on the profits of the company.

Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick. Instead, they have willfully created panic. Just like your ad would.

__label__Evidence	wikipedia is a helpful source of information for research and educational purposes
__label__Evidence	we should not show preference to one website
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is useful in helping people of all ages learn about various topics..
__label__Evidence	other places can provide information for free so why should wikipedia get money for doing the same thing?
__label__Evidence	wikipedia has been supported by voluntary donations for too long. subsidizing it would give it more credibility, and would allow the volunteers to continue to update it with the most accurate information.
__label__Evidence	subsidization may allow those providing the finances to have influence on entries that are in their interest
__label__Evidence	to keep it as a source of information and because it does not receive funding it ought to be subsidized

__label__Evidence	wikipedia has the potential to be the greatest source of freely accessible information, a subsidy could help to reach this goal whereas currently the funding is becoming a bigger threat to its existence
__label__Evidence	it is a valuable resource so a subsidy would help by allowing the website to produce and edit more quality articles

In addition, there could be a discussion in which only verified users (real people) could have access to the press's online chat/discussion under the reported topic.
__label__Evidence	We are increasingly witnessing malicious journalism, corrupted by feelings and disinformation. The purpose of the press services must, as soon as possible, be to bring the news back to the public in the most detailed and detailed manner possible, without inciting malicious and incorrect drawing of attention.
__label__Evidence	The EU deciding who is a journalist amounts to the EU deciding what is true.
__label__Position	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__Position	Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond
__label__Evidence	The range of primary care services should be available to all patients universally, with special emphasis on those at the margins, often in most need.
__label__Evidence	Mass migration is an evil that hurts the nations as well as the migrants themselves, who suffer indignities and risk their lives. We must end mass migration. This requires that migrants be helped as close to the origin of migration as possible.
__label__Position	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Evidence	The undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.
__label__Evidence	Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.
__label__Evidence	Directly electing the president of the commission makes the most susceptible to political sway, which would kill the commission as a body of technical experts.
__label__Evidence	How would the candidates be selected? One per country? That just makes it a tight race between the two countries with the largest population (assuming one vote per person). Why would e.g. a Greek person vote for a Swedish candidate? How would even a Swedish candidate campaign in such a way as to appeal to Greek voters?
__label__Evidence	In Germany, the President of the Executive is not elected by the people directly either. The reason for this is the horrible experience during the Third Reich. The Parliament - as the only constitutional institution being directly elected - has a stronger stand if the President is not elected directly. However I definitely support, that the Parliament becomes stronger and more influential.
__label__Evidence	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.
__label__Evidence	The European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else. An elected head of the Commission would make nonsense of the principle of independence that is vital to the trust in the Commission's job. He or she would be beholden to the group that elected him or her and make the job impossible.
__label__Evidence	European political parties should be independent of national parties. There should be primaries open for the citizens to choose the candidate, it would increase citizen participation and involvement in EU politics.
__label__Position	We should stop integration.
__label__Evidence	All refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left.
__label__Evidence	All refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left.
__label__Position	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__Evidence	The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.
__label__Evidence	Public services of good quality and universal access are key to ensuring fairer, more inclusive, and equal societies. They have a clear redistributive effect and help steer development in a more sustainable direction. The Covid-19 crisis if anything helped to prove the crucial role that the public sector and public services play and must continue playing!
__label__Position	There should be a president for the EU elected by the people.
__label__Evidence	We need one single president of the Commission that will chair the Commission and the Council. I wonder though how the president of the EU Parliament would be involved in this structure.
__label__Evidence	We should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.
__label__Evidence	The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 Frenchman would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own above people whose countries the Americans have bombed to shreds.
__label__Evidence	It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.
__label__Evidence	Our Europe continent is in debt and doesn't have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to disregard our laws! We have enough poor people in Europe already and we need to take care of them!
__label__Evidence	What are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money? The religion? The food? Their political system? And then reevaluate each year? This comment is plain ignorant.

__label__Position	Donald Trump's Presidency was a good thing
__label__Evidence	Trump has been prioritizing some noticeable issues like the Muslim immigration clampdown, challenging the independence of the Fed, bizarre and ill-qualified cabinet selections, antagonizing China and other trading partners for no reason or embracing Russia and its rogue regime. This is not acceptable beyond limits and can turn people and communities against him.
__label__Evidence	Racism &amp; white supremacy has increased in Trump's term.
__label__Position	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Position	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Evidence	At present, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure the security of data. On the other hand, developed countries already have an efficient infrastructure. So, rushing toward data localization may not be a wise step. Because without efficient infrastructure, the data is prone to cyber-attacks. And the risk is severe here because it is financial data. But as the laws are made, it is a big challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.
__label__Evidence	Storing data in India means higher operational costs for payment system operators. Because in other countries they have cheaper alternatives. And also for cross-border transactions, they have to store the data in two places, which increases costs. There is a probability that these extra costs may pass on to the consumers.
__label__Evidence	Data localization laws result in the setting up of multiple data centers locally. This will create many jobs and will help the country’s economy immensely. It will also drive innovation in the field resulting in low-cost solutions.
__label__Evidence	While investigating crimes, there will be a need to access the payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to take permission from that country for access to the data. This causes delays in solving crimes. If the data is stored here within our country, this problem will be avoided.
__label__Evidence	India is a big consumer market for many foreign companies. So, India and other developing countries are realizing the economic value of the data and the importance of data localization. With data localization, domestic companies and the country’s economy will be benefited. And we can also ensure the security of the data.
__label__Evidence	Data is considered a ‘new form of wealth’. Generally, companies use data to understand the requirements of consumers and also to influence their behavior. New products can be developed by analyzing the data to meet the needs of consumers. So the data has an economic value. In general, developed countries are utilizing this opportunity with their well-developed infrastructure.
__label__Evidence	We are in a globalized world. At present, the world is running on the free flow of people, goods, services, and data. Data localization laws seem to be a part of protectionist policies, which is a threat to the free flow of data.
__label__Evidence	The US is against data localization laws. Recently at the G20 summit, Donald Trump, the president of the US spoke against data localization. Its stance is natural because it increases the operational costs of US companies. India-US bilateral relations are important for both countries because we are intertwined in the export and import of IT services, professionals and goods, etc. So, imposing data localization laws without threatening Indo-US relations is another challenge.
__label__Evidence	We can ensure data privacy by localizing the data.
__label__Evidence	Data localization may result in government surveillance of its citizens.
__label__Evidence	Data localization is important for data sovereignty, which means the data of the citizens should be owned by the respective governments and not by other countries.
__label__Position	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Evidence	Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd world countries. This includes fighting for climate justice and decreasing unequal wealth distribution between countries.
__label__Evidence	Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden's Stockholm has become the Rape Capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has skyrocketed as well in that country. France is bordering on civil war, whole territories are not under state control anymore. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We need to put our European peoples first, much like the entire world is doing while our civilization is committing suicide based on values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists.
__label__Evidence	There's nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and putting your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as self-evident. We need to negotiate Remigration deals with the 3rd countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push back any migrants coming to our borders.
__label__Evidence	We are Europeans; this is not racism but we don't support growth. If we accept many immigrants then we make a huge stop in the growth of the migrant countries, because I am 100% sure that they will never ever go back to their country.
__label__Evidence	I have no trouble with, non-western, immigrants. I have trouble with 'mass immigration'. What happens is when they come in large numbers they do not integrate anymore. They stick to themselves and become a new tribe that tries to change their host country.'
__label__Evidence	Europe should look at the European people first. It is not fair for the working classes to have to live within the ruins of multiculturalism while the middle class supports immigration from within their gated communities.
__label__Evidence	Immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration.

__label__Position	Climate neutrality can be achieved only by nuclear energy
__label__Evidence	if we want stable, reliable energy grid we need a nuclear energy source. Solar energy and wind are not reliable, need a lot of batteries, and can not be a sole solution for the energy grid.
__label__Evidence	We need to ensure fair redistribution of refugees across Europe and ensure better integration of refugees and applicants for international protection into the workplace. More concrete and fairer European policy on economic migration, to establish legal channels for entry and to foster an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as a key tool to address the social impact of migration flows.
__label__Position	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
__label__Position	There should be an EU citizenship
__label__Evidence	If we do have an EU citizenship we will have an EU country and EU already proved to be no good dealing with problems and is extremely undemocratic and not listening to the people.
__label__Evidence	Bad governance, unreasonable spending, and corruption are damaging and unsustainable which means, we can't afford to leave them alone if we want to have a future.
__label__Evidence	The EU needs to focus on simplifying and standardizing European processes and procedures associated with public management and creating efficient and effective anti-corruption mechanisms. This will reduce the financial resources to be made available to the most relevant areas of intervention at the EU, country, and regional Levels.
__label__Evidence	The law is very clear that RTI is not just concerned with government bodies alone. It is also for Non-Government Organisations which are substantially financed and controlled by the Government. There are numerous subsidies (including Tax exemptions) that the Political parties enjoy, thereby, they are substantially financed by the Government.
__label__Evidence	Political parties are independent bodies, they need not be accountable to the public. They were not established by the constitution or an act of parliament.
__label__Evidence	The RTI Act states that wherever there is Public Interest, those organizations need to be transparent and come under the ambit of the law. There are numbers of Private organizations today, whether partially funded or fully; schools, hospitals, etc. that are under the RTI Act and not just Government organizations.
__label__Evidence	There are adequate provisions in the Income Tax law and with the Election Commission so that people can have whatever information they want.
__label__Evidence	The RTI Act has provisions under section 8 which mention the concept of Competitive Interest. Certain exemptions are provided in cases where it can be proved that divulging information can hurt the Competitive Advantage of the party. This is not just a problem with Political Parties but a lot of Government and Private bodies too.
__label__Evidence	Political funding is believed to be the fountainhead of corruption. The citizens have the right to know where the political parties are raising these funds from, how they spend these funds, and the basis of their decisions. Crony capitalism will be hugely curbed if political parties are brought under RTI Act.
__label__Evidence	Under the IT Act, political parties do not need to disclose donations that they get below INR 20,000. An informal study done in 2010 on 6 key political parties shows that they raised Rs 700 crore. 95% of the amount was raised by amounts below Rs 20,000. There is a high possibility that the political parties use this loophole to their advantage.
__label__Evidence	Political parties declare certain promises in their manifestos. After getting elected, the citizens have a right to know why the promises made by the political parties were not fulfilled.
__label__Evidence	Political parties are central to the functioning of Democracy. Political Parties go on to form the government. The government policies are then governed by the party’s ideology. Thereby, it becomes essential for political parties to come under the ambit of RTI.
__label__Evidence	If political parties come under the RTI, it will affect their smooth internal functioning. Rivals may use RTI to malign each other. Also, since the political parties are not connected to the public directly, an RTI would be invalid.
__label__Position	We should adopt a multi-party system
__label__Evidence	it would give people more of a choice and provides someone for every culture to vote for
__label__Evidence	We should adopt a multi-party system as the current two party system does not fit the diverse society that it is supposed to represent.
__label__Evidence	the two-party system is cheaper and easier to operate that any multi-party system
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems offer voters more choices and more representation.
__label__Evidence	adopting a multi-party system leads to the formation weak and unstable coalition governments
__label__Evidence	In multi-party systems, there are many types of ideologies - as opposed to two-party systems, where the nation is not divided into two rival groups.
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems slow down what gets done because we have too many different sides trying to come to an agreement
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows for more options and candidates that are more in line with certain populations as not everyone has the same political views.
__label__Evidence	amulti-party system can lead to unstable coalitions in order to get into power
__label__Evidence	too many choices in political parties separates people in a country instead of helping them to unite.
__label__Evidence	A multi-party system allows for greater choice in whom to vote for. It allows each citizen to vote for the party that best fits their beliefs and represents their ideology.
__label__Evidence	a multiparty system blurs the citizenship of a vision and model of country. we should not adopt a multiparty system because it would waste valuable time to agree
__label__Evidence	tywo party systems no longer reflect the growing diversity of political views, only a multi party system can do this.
__label__Evidence	it makes a mockery of voting for your political party of choice if the end result is a multi-party system which will lead to people not voting if they feel they do not have a say.
__label__Evidence	A multi-party system would bring in a lot more choice of representation for the people living in the country.
__label__Evidence	introducing a multi-party system would be detrimental to stability and consistency of our political system
__label__Evidence	we must have more options to choose and leave this bipartisan dictatorship
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems help decentralize power and better represent the various interests of different socio-economic strata within a nation.
__label__Evidence	multiple parties make choosing a leader harder
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems provide many new sources of views on relevant topics
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system will help to ensure that more political agendas will be given the chance to represent the people
__label__Evidence	a two-party system has served us well for years; why change what has worked?
__label__Evidence	the multi-party system works and ensures that everybody has their say
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system leads to too much division and there may never be an overall consensus
__label__Evidence	a multi-party ensures that all people and voices are heard and represented.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system will lack real leadership and will mean that policies often end up being diluted or not passed at all as a majority can not be reached.
__label__Evidence	multiple parties will just confuse people and cause more divisiveness in society
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system weakens speed of decision making and ensures no progress is made so we should not adopt it.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system would be too confusing
__label__Evidence	In a multi-party system, minority needs are better catered to.
__label__Evidence	a multi party system is too volatile, there's no stability and no consistency
__label__Evidence	too much parties are dangerous for cohesion.
__label__Evidence	in a multi party system the general population have more of a choice in who their leaders are
__label__Evidence	a multi party system will lead to the rise of fringe groups that do not represent the will of the people.
__label__Evidence	we should no adopt a multi-party system because nothing would ever get done with varying points of view.
__label__Evidence	the interests of a two party system are very limited and we need to expand with more parties to cater to more views
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems bring diversity to politics, and giving more voices to the population
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems encourage the formation of weak and unstable coalitions that achieve little beyond their own day to day survival
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system spreads votes out to thin,so as one leader can be victorious even though they did not receive the majority of the peoples' votes.
__label__Evidence	could open up congress and create new opportunities for bargaining and coalition building on unusual lines.
__label__Evidence	if it ain't broke, don't fix it. it is working and has for a long time.
__label__Evidence	A multi-party system prevents the leadership of a single party from setting policy without challenge.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows a greater freedom of choice for voters to express their democratic right to vote for policies they would like to implimented.
__label__Evidence	currently 2 parties can't agree enough to accomplish anything, it would only get worse to get multiple parties to all agree on anything.
__label__Evidence	consensus can become difficult in multi party systems
__label__Evidence	this would result in inaccurate representation in government. if there where numerous parties, votes would be split all over and the party people least wanted would win resulting in inaccurate representation.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system makes it much more difficult to collaborate on ideas.
__label__Evidence	they can lead to too much indecision
__label__Evidence	a poll shows that more than 90% of the people are in support of a multi-party system in the usa.
__label__Evidence	this would possibly eliminate the war between democrats and republicans.
__label__Evidence	more parties will create a more convoluted political system
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems lead to more corruption and wasted campaign dollars.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows for the airing of more viewpoints and would require politicians to build coalitions and compromise in order to get things accomplished.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system could add more complexity and create situations where issues become impossible to resolve.
__label__Evidence	a key advantage of a multi-party system is that voters have a choice of which political party they can choose to elect.
__label__Evidence	more political parties give people more of a choice to support what they believe in.
__label__Evidence	the multi-party system offers voters more choices that may get more people involved in politics
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system would help create more options for voters.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows for more unqualified people to get into the race
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system is the fairest representation of all political viewpoints, and would increase the electorate's engagement with politics in general.
__label__Evidence	the current system is broken and doesn't work. neither side can work together so having more options would force politicians to come together and do what's best for the people because no side would be majority
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system could lead to more situations where a majority is not reached. this means that it could be harder to push policies through.
__label__Evidence	the two-party system is outdated and has proven, lately, that it does not always result in the best possible candidates.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a multi-party system because it makes it so that there is naturally more of a choice
__label__Evidence	this would provide more choices and let us see more points of view
__label__Evidence	a multi party system creates chaos by giving too many choices to the people
__label__Evidence	a multi party system would bring many new & fresh ideas into the forefront
__label__Evidence	a multiparty system would be too decentralized
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system offers too many options and decreases the election voting for one candidate, spreading out the votes over too many options.
__label__Evidence	Multiple-party systems often have candidates with radical views whereas two-party systems tend to be more moderate.
__label__Evidence	Minority parties have too much power. A winning party often has to offer concessions to small, minority parties in order to form a government.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows for a broad range of ideas to be heard and implemented.
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems are proven around the world to work better
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems fragments power so much that nothing ever gets done and government is rendered ineffectual.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows for more ideas, more candidates, more voters turning out.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party is essential to allow for democracy and prevent autocratic regimes coming to power.
__label__Evidence	we need better representation of all people. the two party system is broken and only represents a select few.
__label__Evidence	In a multi-party system, parties are more easily manipulated by the political agendas of different groups.
__label__Evidence	there are too many diverse political philosophies to be crammed into 2 parties
__label__Evidence	It is less likely for two party systems to have cooperation or coalitions based on extremist ideology.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system would bring more choices for people to speak up and vote.
__label__Evidence	we absolutely need a multi party system. the two party system is a failure. the entire country can't be split in to only two categories. we need better representation of the people.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a multi-party system because we need more than one opinion to round out solutions.
__label__Evidence	by having a multi-party system people would be able to support parties with their values and the a larger party may adopt polices from the smaller one for support
__label__Evidence	The winner can be someone voted in to office by a very small percentage of voters.
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems should not be allowed as it only causes a no win-win situation when the other parties can not agree upon a situation.
__label__Evidence	it can become confusing when voting on a multi-party system
__label__Evidence	it would allow more voices to be heard and more choice.
__label__Evidence	a multi party system allows far better choices for the diverse population, meaning they can find someone to vote for that they truly believe in and participate in a democracy better
__label__Evidence	it will give a stronger representation of the electorate.
__label__Evidence	as many people's views don't fall in line with the two large parties, we can't say the current system is truly representative.
__label__Position	We need an integrated migration and border policy.
__label__Evidence	The EU member states need to lift together instead of trying to push the burdens onto each other or external nations.
__label__Evidence	The EU member states need to lift together instead of trying to push the burdens onto each other or external nations.
__label__Position	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__Position	Serbia should join the EU.
__label__Evidence	The EU should continue its enlargement to the Western Balkans to further its own interests, and to bring stability and prosperity to the region. Serbia should have joined long ago.
__label__Position	The EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states
__label__Evidence	Hungary’s and Poland’s governments have ruthlessly corrupted their judgments to get a free card on abstract EU funds. Enough! If even Romania can be carried out to join the enhanced cooperation, those last two must be forced.
__label__Evidence	The EU must take a strong position against corruption and be in favor of an independent, supranational proscecutor that is the EPPO.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely unacceptable because it would lead to the politicization of the justice system.
__label__Evidence	It is unacceptable. Every nation has the right to organize its own prosecution system and no foreign prosecutor should be allowed to operate in independent states, it is a threat to the sovereignty of the member states.
__label__Position	The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world
__label__Evidence	Democracy and civilization are the essences of Europe and the EU must uphold those values. For me, the word civilization is also to be civil, which in some way is the opposite of being militarized. The EU should not be a superpower. Nuclear detergence should be enough.
__label__Evidence	There is enough environmental task to handle and Europe have had its wars. But to streamline our powers and therefore try to save huge amounts of money is a no-brainer.
__label__Position	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__Position	We should legalize organ trade
__label__Evidence	We should legalize the organ trade because currently people are punished for obeying the law and not purchasing organs, in the form of longer wait times.
__label__Evidence	we need more organs than people donate so legalizing it would be a good thing
__label__Evidence	if we legalize the organ trade we will save lives, by ensuring that more people who need an organ transplant actually get one.
__label__Evidence	Organ sales increase the likelihood that people with rare blood types or conditions can find an organ.
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize organ trade because then people would be selling their organs just for money
__label__Evidence	legalizing organ trade would being about more healthy organs and tissue for transplanting then currently is available.
__label__Evidence	people should be allowed to get organs from other countries by buying them if the wait list for their transplant is too long and they are at risk of dying.
__label__Evidence	Selling organs is dangerous, leading to many deaths on the operating table.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize organ trade because many people who are in need of organs have trouble getting good organs.
__label__Evidence	we would end up in bidding wars where only the rich could be helped
__label__Evidence	legal organ trade would help prevent wait lists
__label__Evidence	legalizing the organ trade would lead to people forcing or coercing other into giving their organs. this would increase death and suffering.
__label__Evidence	organ trade between consenting parties should be an option as it can reduce wait times.
__label__Evidence	people are more likely to share their organs if there is financial benefit to them, increasing supply.
__label__Evidence	organs are expensive, and a legal trade can allow for someone in desperate need to get an organ without money or wait times.
__label__Evidence	people would sell organs because to them money is more important than health, putting them at risk.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing the organ trade would allow more patients to receive the organ transplant they need.
__label__Evidence	everyone should have a choice about what they want to do with their bodies, and if selling an organ is one of them, they should be free to decide.
__label__Evidence	people should be able to do what they want with their bodies.
__label__Evidence	legalising organ trade would put an end to the black market trading.
__label__Evidence	organ trade must remain illegal. there is far too much potential for corruption and human trafficking/murder if organs can be sold.
__label__Evidence	the sale of organs may lead to a black market of such, where people may give birth and raise children just for their organs.
__label__Evidence	there is never going to be enough voluntary donation to meet demand, opening up an organ trade could remedy this drastic gap in supply to help save lives
__label__Evidence	a human being at death can help others to live and through organ trade help their families live
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't legalize organ trade because is horror for familiys

__label__Evidence	The three-strikes law is a deterrent against crime.

__label__Evidence	We should abolish the three-strikes laws because a crime is a crime and the criminal need to be punished for what type of crime they are committing and not base on how many times they committed the crime
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law is a powerful deterrent that acts as a fixed punishment for people not to develop a life of crime as they are always aware of the power of the law and the fixed penalty.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes laws can keep some people from having a chance to get out and reform themselves.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law is unfair to those criminals who are trying to reform themselves.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the three strikes law. it doesn't deter crime and it is expensive to implement because it means more people will be prison for life. taxpayers don't deserve to pay for that.
__label__Evidence	three-strikes laws makes criminals less likely to reoffend.
__label__Evidence	the three strikes law teaches criminals you will no longer be able to keep committing crimes and getting away with it.
__label__Evidence	three-strike laws give a clear message to offenders who may be in danger of re-offending, that doing so would be met with more severity than their first offense. that way it works as a clear deterent.
__label__Evidence	three strikes is too many in some cases. if people know they have three chances, they will not be deterred from using that to their advantage.
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws are expensive because they increase how long people are incarcerated which must be paid for by tax payers.
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws lead to more people being put in jail which ends up being a burden on tax-payers and federal funding.
__label__Evidence	there are individuals that have received strikes against them for minor crimes or things done as teens. there is no magic number in three. sentences should depend on the type and severity of crimes.

__label__Evidence	three strikes laws lack nuance and fail to evaluate circumstances around crimes committed.
__label__Evidence	criminals are bound to repeat themselves, and with increasing risk. the three strikes law would punish those criminals accordingly.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law is unfair to those whose crimes are minimal verses those whose crimes are very bad.
__label__Evidence	repeat offenders need to be punished severely.
__label__Evidence	We should abolish the three-strikes laws because they introduce arbitrary punishment for some crimes over others, when the action was the same.
__label__Evidence	The three-strikes law gives victims peace of mind that the person who perpetuated a crime against them won't one day return and harm them again.
__label__Evidence	they laws don't stop crime, they just punish people harder.
__label__Evidence	criminals should have a chance to go straight, even if they've committed the same crime multiple times.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law is good at keeping criminals off of the streets
__label__Evidence	if there are 3 minor offenses there is no need to overly punish someone.
__label__Evidence	As people age they tend to commit less crimes, keeping individuals in jail for life only because of three-strikes laws is a waste of money and doesn't protect society.
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish the three-strikes laws because they are popular with voters and it would be undemocratic to remove them.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law shouldn't be abolished because by having the law it keeps repeat offenders in prisons and gets them off of the streets.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the three-strikes laws because they can put people away for minor crimes
__label__Evidence	if people are habitually re-offending then they need a punishment that will stop them. a mandatory prison sentence is the minimum they should have as a punishment.
__label__Evidence	Three strike laws take habitual offenders off the street, reducing overall crime.
__label__Evidence	three-strike offenders are habitual criminals and should be treated as such
__label__Evidence	if a person has been arrested for three crimes they have not learned from their mistakes but see being a criminal as a lifestyle. let's put those people behind bars and prevent more crimes.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the three strikes laws because the punishment is just enough for their convictions and no need to add more another years.
__label__Evidence	The three-strikes law makes judicial discretion - one of the hallmarks of our justice system - superfluous.
__label__Evidence	criminals shouldn't get extra chances when committing crimes anyway, so the three-strikes law is not necessary.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the three-strikes laws because they result in reduced crime rates
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws increase violence against law enforcement since an accused criminal facing the potential for a life sentence is more likely to fight back against law enforcement to escape.
__label__Evidence	three-strikes laws can act as a deterrent for serial criminal behavior.
__label__Evidence	three strikes allows someone to make a genuine mistake and not be punished as harshly right away.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the three-strikes law because the definition of a previous violent offense could be arbitrary and prisons need to be places for rehabilitation, not excessive punishment.
__label__Evidence	Three-strike laws lead to expensive trials. Three-strike offenders will demand a court trial rather than accept a plea bargain (which costs a fraction of the price of a full-blown trial).
__label__Evidence	it causes people to receive disproportionately high sentences for petty crimes
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish the three-strikes laws in all cases, but it should be up to judicial discretion, so that the worst criminal are off the streets.
__label__Evidence	three-strikes laws are a major reason for overcrowding in our prison system.
__label__Evidence	if we got rid of three-strikes laws, there would be little deterrent for career criminals.
__label__Evidence	if people do not learn from their mistakes and corrections then they are unfit to live among society.
__label__Evidence	three-strike laws should be abolished as it negatively impact minorities and people of color who are more likely to commit crime due to poverty issues.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the three-strikes laws because i don't think people should be given more than one chance, they are grown adults and know right from wrong
__label__Evidence	the three strikes law is an old concept. it doesn't really prevent people from committing violence, especially because many acts of violence are not premeditated.
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws are difficult to understand or conceptualize, so they are ineffective at preventing crime.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes laws prevent rehabilitation for those who have committed minor offensives such as substance abuse treatment that can prevent future criminal acts.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't abolish the three-strikes law because it does give criminals a fair warning which is two chances of bad behavior and then if you do it again, you're no longer in society. violent crime is reduced
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws are perfectly constitutional since the punishment isn't unusual and they are proportional to frequency of crime if not intensity of criminal action.
__label__Evidence	we need to take control of criminals and hold them responsible for their actions.
__label__Evidence	it is unjust and discriminates against minorities
__label__Evidence	if someone is habitually offending, they deserve to be punished on the harshest level.
__label__Evidence	this law keeps communities safe from career criminals
__label__Evidence	not everyone can be reformed. some people are a danger to society, and two failed attempts at reform is far more than they deserve.
__label__Evidence	this law is unfair to those who's third crime is minor and thought should be given to changing the criteria of the third crime.
__label__Evidence	three-strikes laws often lead to harsh punishments that do not fit their crimes
__label__Evidence	the three strikes law punishes people to harshly for minor crimes. they shouldn't have to spend the rest of their lives in prison unless they are crimes that harm another person.
__label__Evidence	The three-strikes law gives no room for mitigating factors to be considered, making our justice system a rigid one that does not allow for true justice.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the three-strikes laws but we could improve them so that people who have committed only a minor offence are not jailed for life.

__label__Evidence	the three strikes law make it hard for those criminals who are trying to reform.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law serves as an effective deterrent and should not be abolished.

__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the three-strikes laws because the criminal deserves what they did and justice must be done unto them
__label__Evidence	many people could pay long sentences for nonviolent crimes
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law should be abolished. each convicted crime should be punished individually. it isn't right to judge a person solely on their criminal history.
__label__Evidence	The three-strikes law should be abolished and the punishment should always fit the crime so if the third crime is petty then they should have a minimal sentence or fine rather than prison terms.
__label__Evidence	Since prison's radicalize more than they rehabilitate, three strikes laws end up creating more re-offenders by putting people away for longer in an environment that radicalizes them.
__label__Evidence	I am happy to see that the ide of haling all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is still going strong. This message needs to be communicated to Brussels very clearly.
__label__Evidence	European citizens are the future of Europe!
__label__Evidence	Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Regressive outdated ideologies and values should have no place in Europe.
__label__Evidence	The migrants that are already (legally) here should be taught western values so they and their families can integrate/assimilate, as the age-old saying goes 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'.
__label__Evidence	In Conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we are making business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '
__label__Evidence	Europe must stay Europe and people must not be imposed a cultural and religious change they do not want and which is insane. Look at what the Arabic or north African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islam.
__label__Evidence	We need to stop all funding to NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. Then can we talk about how to help the people already here and how to help real people in need.
__label__Evidence	We need to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in centers for repatriation.
__label__Evidence	Marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists!

__label__Position	Technology is rising Unemployment rates
__label__Evidence	Several kinds of jobs are increasingly getting replaced by technology. As per the reports, there is a significant drop in the typists, weavers, construction workers etc.
__label__Evidence	If any business depends heavily on human labour, it tends to fail as it cannot cope up with the competition from the technologically advanced competitors.
__label__Evidence	Esperanto should be promoted as an international lingua franca. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of cross-cultural communication, allowing high degrees of inclusion.
__label__Position	We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage
__label__Evidence	Every child is different. Homeschooling allows to design the curriculum based on the student's capabilities and interests.
__label__Evidence	Children can better explore themselves when they do not have constraints.
__label__Position	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Evidence	In order to promote European peace, prosperity, and precious diversity, a different administration system is needed: a federal Europe, based on a democratic federal constitution instead of anarchy-provoking EU treaties.
__label__Evidence	Catalonia must become independent from the Spanish dictatorial repression that tries to end the Catalan language and culture.
__label__Evidence	Europe was composed of 13 countries in 1870 and 23 in 1914. Maybe it's time to change borders without bloodshed.
__label__Evidence	We live in the XXI century. We do not want any repression of peripheries by their state center. Within the European Union, we should welcome the blessing of decentralism and localism, including the self-determination of stateless peoples and stronger autonomies within confederal agreements. If not in Europe, where? If not now, when?
__label__Evidence	According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR), ‘[a]ll peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The right to self-determination also has its economic content which gives the people the right to freely ‘dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law.'
__label__Evidence	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.
__label__Evidence	Self-determination is a basic collective human right. Catalans practiced this right in 2017. Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence. Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start. If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially. This crucial step will enforce European democracy, the Democracy of Citizens that feel free and respected within European borders.
__label__Evidence	Every nation with its own language and culture, which demands the same status as a sovereign nation within Europe, must have the right to be recognized and respected by people and other member nations/states.
__label__Evidence	There are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.
__label__Evidence	The right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.
__label__Evidence	In a democracy, people have the right to decide on any issue that affects their lives. If more than half of the inhabitants of a region want to form an independent state, they have the right to do so. Going against it is going against the will of the majority of citizens, and therefore, against the very essence of democracy.
__label__Evidence	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.
__label__Evidence	France should offer its seat on the UN Security Council, so European interests are represented.
__label__Position	We need to invest in nuclear energy
__label__Evidence	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable. According to the researchers at RethinkX, we will see a clean energy disruption in the next ten years which will leave investments in oil, coal and nuclear stranded.
__label__Evidence	Promoting, organizing, and directing mass migration is a crime against humanity. Lukashenko is currently committing exactly this heinous crime. But so are George Soros and his NGOs who are engaged in the very same hybrid warfare against Europe when they bring those migrants to our shores.
__label__Evidence	Either the EU will be a fortress against illegal migration or it will not exist anymore in the future.
__label__Evidence	Europe is more than rich enough to welcome many immigrants and if they are permitted to work, they will even generate their own income and benefits for the country they arrive in.
__label__Evidence	You are justifying the genocide of indigenous Europeans who, when asked, always reject these 'refugees'.
__label__Evidence	As EU citizens we should never forget how privileged we are, and that we bear a human obligation to help others in need.
__label__Evidence	It is necessary that member states better share the efforts of receiving asylum seekers upon arrival at EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to frontline countries. The EU should develop a joint approach to support the frontline countries to assure that asylum seeker are provided adequate care, assistance, and protection upon arrival and are quickly distributed evenly throughout the EU for status determination.
__label__Evidence	The root causes to leave their home countries should not be overlooked. The EU and its member states need to increase efforts to make the countries of origin more liveable.
__label__Evidence	Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the greatest existential threat to the EU. Even more so than the CO2 threat.
__label__Position	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__Evidence	This idea is what we have been doing for the last 30 years. It did not produce sufficient results to justify continuing on this path. It is just saying, that problem will solve itself. This proposition is harmful and does not stand on any data that could justify it.
__label__Evidence	It is not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognizing patterns, reasons, and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in a vacuum. If it is easier and cheaper to live not sustainably, people will do it, even if they are conscious of the consequences.
__label__Evidence	We should arrange our cities, our economy, and politics so that it is easy for people to behave ecologically responsibly. It requires a lot of work now, but it is work that we have to do if we want to transition to something more sustainable.
__label__Position	We should consider Russian interests in the EU policy.
__label__Position	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__Position	We should ban naturopathy
__label__Evidence	Intensive Care Medicine deserves to be added to the Annex V, as well as all citizens of the EU deserve top standards of critical care and safety when admitted to this demanding environment.
__label__Evidence	The pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves. We saw patients in very critical condition being moved away from their families from one Member State to another to receive treatment while allowing the doctors to move would be much more efficient and less life-threatening for the patients.
__label__Position	The EU should strengthen its relationship with China.
__label__Evidence	I find the current actions of China to be incompatible with the ideology that the EU was formed and still has to this day, we can not have a relaxed attitude towards a country that sees all the world as competitors and enemies.

__label__Evidence	people have a right to vote and they also have a right not to vote if they don't like any of the candidates
__label__Evidence	you can require voting but you can't force people to educate themselves about the candidates and issues
__label__Evidence	Compulsory voting should be introduced to ensure that the results of elections are completely representative of the population.
__label__Evidence	people being forced to vote when they don't wish to will distort the results with unresearched and made-up candidates that they begrudgingly vote for.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting violates our rights.
__label__Evidence	voting is so important. voter turnout would be much higher if compulsory voting was introduced.

__label__Position	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles
__label__Evidence	Give those who want to come a fair & secure possibility to do so & send those back who really damage your society. Give training, support, opportunities. My guess is that most will pay back with their contributions.
__label__Evidence	We already have successful programs for students from refugee camps. Enhance that.
__label__Evidence	Yes, though some countries have other problems right now. Give member states the possibility to choose: more refugees & more money & support or less refugees & less money & support. Very simple.
__label__Evidence	We should think of more opportunities to enter the EU legally. Many people come illegally, because we refuse them opportunities to come, stay a while for work or education and maybe go back later. People die because of that nonsense.
__label__Evidence	I recently read that especially African families tend to send their smartest, best educated youngsters abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their home countries and for our future. We need skilled & educated people in many sectors, but sends such people back to their home countries, because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees.
__label__Position	Frontex should regularly publish transparency reports
__label__Evidence	Frontex interfering with the national border guards doing their sacred duty to protect the border, and then sending anonymous reports to criticize these brave men and women is quite abhorrent.
__label__Position	People from radical Muslim countries should be banned from entering the EU countries
__label__Evidence	An outright ban on muslim countries is ridiculous, the leadership of these countries and the media depictions of the people of these countries do not reflect the actual people who live there, they are no threat to us
__label__Position	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism
__label__Evidence	I strongly agree with this proposal that trade and investment policy should be reformed, especially, that greater attention should be paid to environmental aspects. The current situation is unsatisfactory and even dangerous.
__label__Evidence	Economic interests should never be at the expense of social and environmental policy. It is of utmost importance that the protection of workers’ rights and the rules we agreed upon with the Paris Agreement on climate change are at the heart of trade and investment policy. As the EU belongs to the global market, we must guarantee decent jobs that are sustainable, as well as collective, independent representation of workers in trade unions.
__label__Evidence	The EU should be able to contribute to a relaunch of global multilateralism, through a profound reform based on democracy and peace, solidarity, and respect for human, social, and environmental rights.
__label__Evidence	We need an investment policy that creates decent jobs and fosters labor rights and especially Trade Unions around the globe. There can not be a sustainable world without collective representation of workers/employees by free Trade Unions.
__label__Evidence	Trade should always include the respect and the protection of fundamental and human rights, including workers' and trade union rights.
__label__Evidence	The protection of fundamental and human rights, decent work, and the high quality of public services for all must be an integral part of trade and investment policy reform.
__label__Evidence	The present international economic system and trade institutions are too much a product of the not-so-glorious colonial past. We should put more democracy, more rights for people, and more equality into the international economic order.
__label__Evidence	Sustainable development and climate change mitigation in EU Trade deals should be examples of best practices of EU policy.
__label__Evidence	The EU needs to both promote and uphold the highest social and environmental standards in its internal as well as external policies. Human rights and collective agreements must never be seen as barriers to trade!
__label__Position	We should decriminalize drug use
__label__Position	Retirement homes should become more common

__label__Evidence	aren't subsidies opening the door for manipulating journalists and inducing media bias in favor of the government?

__label__Evidence	supporting journalism is obligatory in our democracy society and `free speech` should be defended and approved by all means.
__label__Evidence	State subsidies for journalism will make journals financially dependent on the government, which will allow the government to influence what news gets reported and how the reporting is done.
__label__Evidence	keeping journalist in work helps the nation keep up with the news
__label__Evidence	journalists get paid enough, they don't need any more money.

__label__Evidence	we already are in high enough debt, we don't need to make it worse be subsidizing pointless things.
__label__Evidence	When newspapers worry more about the bottom line than the headlines, the quality of the papers goes down resulting in poor pop journalism that panders to the public and the advertisers.
__label__Evidence	journalism is self sustaining and subsidizing it gives the government control over content.
__label__Evidence	Subsidizing journalism increases journalist pay, allowing for better journalism.
__label__Evidence	we need journalists to keep us informed as to what is going on in the world
__label__Evidence	We should subsidize journalism so that journalists can cover the most important issues, rather than only the most profitable ones.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism allows more voices to be heard
__label__Evidence	Without journalism people have no way of having the information that empower them to make informed voting decisions, making journalism central to democracy and therefore in need of subsidization.
__label__Evidence	We should not subsidize journalism because it is not uniquely important to democracy compared to a host of other industries.
__label__Evidence	i believe the government should help pay for journalism because it would allow for better coverage of news events, and help pay the high costs of filming.

__label__Evidence	the is enough money in journalism already, and funds available through subsidies should be redirected towards more worthwhile causes such as healthcare.
__label__Evidence	journalism is important in this country.
__label__Evidence	if journalism is good, then it will not need a subsidy. if it is bad, then we should not be throwing money at it when there are greater needs in society such as education, health care and housing.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism would give the government control over it
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism is unfair. you're basically paying someone to spread your own beliefs.
__label__Evidence	journalism that is subsidized by the government will lead to censoring the media from reporting negative things about the government.

__label__Position	Chinese products should be banned in India
__label__Evidence	India has a huge trade deficit with China. For the year 2017-18, India's imports from China are worth $76.2 billion dollars, whereas India's exports to China are worth $33 billion dollars. So, there is a need to reduce this trade deficit.
__label__Evidence	Imports from China are hurting the businesses of Indian manufacturers, especially Medium Small &amp; Micro Enterprises (MSME) sector. China is able to produce products for cheaper prices because of its mass production methods.
__label__Evidence	China is blocking India's bid to list Masood Azhar as a terrorist. Not just this, China is blocking India from becoming a member of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) using its veto power. On one hand China wants to maintain good trade relations with India, and on the other hand, it is acting against India in many cases. So, maintaining good trade relations with China may not be a good thing.
__label__Position	The EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom
__label__Evidence	We are all for equal rights and opportunities for women, however, modern feminism has gone so far beyond the pale that it can no longer be supported. The BBC has recently found out that 'Some lesbians are increasingly being pressured and coerced into accepting trans women as sexual partners' - in effect fourth-wave feminism has reached the point where males are once again telling females who to have sex with. This must stop.
__label__Position	The EU needs human security approach to ensure peace.

__label__Evidence	When college education is free, the number of graduates will drastically increase. At present, many people do not have access to higher education. So many students are not joining colleges due to the financial status of their parents. Free education will be very helpful for them.
__label__Evidence	At present, the rich are getting richer and poor people are getting poorer. A free college education will reduce social inequality too because as everyone can study and learn the skills in college, everyone will have an equal opportunity to settle in the career of their choice.
__label__Evidence	Some students are taking education loans to study and then they have to work hard to repay their loans. Many people are forced to take up jobs immediately after college to repay loans. But with free education, they will have the liberty in career choices like choosing a job or becoming entrepreneurs or experimenting with gigs, etc.
__label__Evidence	There is a shortage of skilled workers in many countries. When college education is free, this problem will be solved.
__label__Evidence	At present, private investments in education led to improvement in the quality of education. Without the commercialization of education, the quality of education may not improve much.
__label__Position	We should sponsor the general population for taking in migrants
__label__Evidence	Industries are also one of the worst hits. Investors may lose interest to invest in manufacturing sector as bandh by anyone results in the loss to them.
__label__Evidence	Though right to protest is a fundamental right, people do not have right to take away the fundamental rights of others such as going to their work, doing their personal works etc. Not everyone is against to the changes by government. Some people may support it and may not support the ban. Forcing them to stay at home is undemocratic.
__label__Evidence	Most of the bandhs results in violence. Some political parties and organizations intentionally causes violence by setting public properties on fire, by destroying vehicles and by injuring the common people.
__label__Position	Aadhaar should be made mandatory in India

__label__Evidence	libertarianism promotes political freedom of choice as its core value, and is the ultimate expression of democracy.
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt libertarianism because people's lives are better when they know they have a social safety net to fall back on, and that they won't starve if they lose their job.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism would be a huge mistake, especially for the poor in our nation.
__label__Evidence	working together for a greater good favouring the less well off and giving freedom of choice can only benefit society as a whole.
__label__Evidence	adopting libertarianism would eliminate many social programs, reducing access t food and health care to those in need
__label__Evidence	libertarianism allows people to make their own choices without government interference.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt libertarianism for fear of the threat to law and order.
__label__Evidence	lower taxes and more freedom from big government would be the result if we adopted libertarianism.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism is a selfish and dangerous philosophy, devoid of empathy and charity. if it were to become the dominant political system, we would see a huge increase in social inequality.
__label__Evidence	without regulations and welfare, society would collapse into vast pools of crime and poverty
__label__Evidence	Libertarianism increases individual liberties by preventing the government from controlling every aspect of our lives.
__label__Evidence	libertarians are more fair than other politicians.
__label__Evidence	Libertarianism would end all the state run programs that people rely on.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism disavows government control and allows people to have liberties that have been stifled by the governing body.

__label__Position	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately
__label__Evidence	I opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.
__label__Evidence	I opt without a doubt that the Balkan countries should be already accepted as EU members so that their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.

__label__Position	Temples in India can have Gender-Specific rules
__label__Position	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__Evidence	The COVID crisis has shown, that we are very vulnerable. Critical industries must stay in Europe. Infrastructure in the EU especially critical infrastructure must remain under full and absolute European control.
__label__Evidence	It will bring the EU more jobs, less unemployment, and more added value.
__label__Position	We should prevent the surveillance state
__label__Position	Imprisonment of foreign criminals should be carried out in their country
__label__Evidence	Integration and immigration in a host country require a lot of effort
__label__Evidence	This will relieve the European prison system. This would encourage many migrants to take responsibility for the laws of the host countries.
__label__Evidence	Gas power plants produce CO2. Climate-damaging methane is released during extraction and transport, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste - a legacy for future generations - not to mention the current danger of release, e.g. through attacks, geological events, or operational accidents due to human or technical errors.
__label__Evidence	If we continue investing in climate and environmentally damaging, regressive, and immensely expensive nuclear power plants or technologies is a mockery of the world and a waste of money and time that we can use for sustainable investments and transformations.
__label__Evidence	Europe has more than enough ideological disputes within its own borders. We must settle those first - by falling back on a previous, more classical liberal position that was uncontroversial for most of our citizens. Countries outside the EU must deal with their own problems as best they can. Less interference from Europe is the order of the day, not more.
__label__Position	We should further develop robotization
__label__Position	European Union should help young people to train in refugee countries
__label__Evidence	This should help to tackle the causes of lack of prospects and absconding from these countries in order to increase the willingness of young people to stay in their homes

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions cause a weight on country governments that have violated human rights, dangerous acts, et al and the only thing that governments can relate to are monetary hardships.
__label__Evidence	sanctions ultimately only hit the general population of the country affected, especially the vulnerable. this serves to stir up bad feeling towards the countries implementing the sanction.
__label__Evidence	we should not end the use of economic sanctions because they help the nations with exports and imports of goods
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions must be retained as it is the only way in which dishonest countries can be made to mend their ways.
__label__Evidence	Economic sanctions are immoral and hurt the people they are supposed to be protecting.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions hurt poorer citizens

__label__Evidence	we should support economic sanctions to keep others from violating interests
__label__Evidence	the only ones that suffer with economic sanctions are the regular citizens of the countries.
__label__Evidence	the use of economic sanctions should be ended because it is important to keep a good relationship with the countries we trade with.
__label__Evidence	cooperation among countries is essential nowadays. avoiding armed conflict when one country's terrorizing others by the use of economic sanctions is a great solution to return that country back more cooperation
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are a way to implement sanctions on a country without the risks of military intervention.
__label__Evidence	we should end the usage of economic sanctions because it is incredibly cruel to the citizens of the country being sanctioned, especially the poor. sanctions don't necessarily stop wars either.
__label__Evidence	you shouldn't have to share what you have with other places who do things that are against your country's beliefs.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions have little effect when power is concentrated to an individual like a dictator, because the dictator doesn't care about the suffering of their people.

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are an effective way to limit the ability of corrupt governments

__label__Evidence	there are usually totally just reasons for imposing sanctions. those reasons could be political or even sometimes military based, but are usually done for the greater good of all.

__label__Position	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products
__label__Evidence	If all costs, including CO2 emissions of the production, the extraction of resources and its consequences for the region (environment and humans), ecosystem damage, recycling of the waste, and so on and so forth would be monetized and internalized in the costs of the products, many of our problems would be solved. It would simply make the more environmentally friendly products cheaper than the others and their production economically smarter.
__label__Evidence	In a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.
__label__Evidence	why should every country in the EU be sovereign in energy production? Within the countries also not every region is sovereign in this sense. We need to take advantage of the geographic potentials of the european continent for pragmatic solutions
__label__Position	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__Position	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Evidence	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.
__label__Evidence	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.
__label__Evidence	It is absolutely necessary that we have a system of accountability, both for member states and other countries. Human rights and liberties always come first!
__label__Evidence	The European Union is not a country and we must respect other countries' electoral choices.
__label__Evidence	Mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.
__label__Evidence	Several member states have been turned into dictatorships a year ago, and there is no sign of a return to democracy. Freezing temporarily their EU membership status is to be considered to those where there is no more freedom in crossing borders (BE), even inside borders (DE, FR), no more press freedom (most), no more debate (most), no more press or individual liberty.
__label__Evidence	To have any credibility when addressing foreign countries regarding issues of human rights violations, curbs on the freedom of speech and press, democracy, and more, the EU must ensure that its Member States meet minimum standards on these fronts too.
__label__Evidence	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.
__label__Evidence	The EU has no business 'promoting democracy' anywhere beyond its borders. Have we not seen sufficiently clearly in the past two decades where 'democracy export' leads?! Freedom bombs and human suffering everywhere. No, the EU must fully respect the sovereignty and national characters of all nations of this world. And that includes its own member states. The EU must immediately return to the letter of the EU treaties, and reaffirm in the strongest term the principles of conferral and subsidiarity.
__label__Evidence	The EU should do it in an impartial manner and act against all countries regardless of political ideology. The EU should stand out to help all minorities and not just the politically advantageous ones. The oppression of Catalonians and Hungarian minorities outside its border is a constant problem since WW2 and it is completely ignored. If the EU wants to convince the masses, then it can't just cherrypick issues.
__label__Position	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__Evidence	Without a change in the voting procedure, Europe will not be capable of doing much in this world.
__label__Evidence	The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.
__label__Position	Europe should change the world for the better for everyone.
__label__Evidence	The EU should not get involved in trying to ”spread democracy” with threats and punishments, leave that to the US.
__label__Evidence	The integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about. Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development? They are as much Europeans as we are.
__label__Position	We should reintroduce nuclear power in Germany
__label__Evidence	Do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately. The EU does not have an actual army - not because of bureaucrats but because our member states think they are better alone than united.
__label__Position	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Evidence	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener. In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.
__label__Evidence	The incentive to provide free public transport in European cities in the future would make it easier for people, especially in the cities, to accept and appreciate that there will be fewer and fewer cars. People who benefit from current examples are happy about it.
__label__Evidence	I think the EU should subsidies troubled cash-strapped cities to reduce ticket prices or completely remove any charges so that people are vivisected to hop on the bus rather than in the car. As I student, I would have been in the city center a lot more and spent money around the shops if I could afford the bus fair in the first place.
__label__Position	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__Evidence	Such a platform if it provides youngsters with free or at least affordable mental-health assistance, will help them finally able to overcome our society’s barriers to taking care of our mental health and emotional well-being.
__label__Evidence	There is a reason why these states don't want to join the common currency: their economies are more flexible and doing far better without it. If we really want more countries to start using the euro, we need to make the euro better, not pressure or force others into our inefficient system.
__label__Position	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government.
__label__Evidence	We certainly need levels of government at the global, regional, and local levels. Equally, we absolutely need democracy at the global, regional, and local levels. Neither the European nor the national and regional parliaments should be abolished because of the need for global governance for the planet.
__label__Position	We should have all workers working in private enterprises share equity in the company they work for
__label__Position	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Evidence	According to the United Nations Convention on the rights of people with disabilities, the European Union “shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities” on political decisions that concern them. Meanwhile the “European Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030” hardly mentioned people with intellectual and neurological disabilities. Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities. Ableism keeps getting perpetuated in the EU and it needs to stop. We want more representation! We want people with Down Syndrome to be fully included in the European Union institutions!
__label__Evidence	Aborting children with Down is not love, is not an inclusive society, it is discrimination against the most vulnerable.
__label__Evidence	People with trisomy 21 in Europe have much higher rates of unemployment, social exclusion, poverty, and discrimination. The European Union must make it a priority to change this situation.
__label__Evidence	Europe must lead the way when it comes to integrating people with Down syndrome
__label__Evidence	The United States is investing an average of more or less 25 million euros per year on health care research for people with Trisomy 21 while the European Union is lagging far behind with only 3 million per year. This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21.
__label__Evidence	A common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data. The data should be accessible for public research and used for monitoring public health e.g. by European institutions
__label__Position	We should subsidize space exploration
__label__Evidence	there are more important things to spend public funds on such as health care, housing and education.
__label__Evidence	there is so much more to explore and learn about space that subsidising space exploration would bring us closer to learning and understanding what is beyond our planet.
__label__Evidence	there are much more important things to spend money on; space exploration is a low priority and should not be subsidized
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a waste of money that could be used to feed people
__label__Evidence	space exploration is the next frontier.
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize space exploration because there are far more important things to spend public money on closer to home such as healthcare, education and transport infrastructure
__label__Evidence	we need to subsidize space exploration in order to find an inhabitable planet we can live on when we finally destroy the one we live on now.
__label__Evidence	space exploration doesn't have any immediate benefits for the general public
__label__Evidence	Space travel has health dangers. Astronauts and space tourists face risks from radiation, which can cause illness and injure organs.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize space exploration because someday we may have to leave earth behind once we deplete all our resources or because of a nuclear war.
__label__Evidence	there is nothing that can come from space research that will help the country so why waste so much money?
__label__Evidence	space exploration has the ability to solve the problem of limited materials on earth
__label__Evidence	subsidizing space exploration takes money away from more important issues.
__label__Evidence	we need to subsidize space exploration so we can find somewhere for the human race to go when we finally get done destroying our planet.
__label__Evidence	space exploration needs our support to help us understand the universe and our place in it.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a waste of taxpayers money and should be funded by private enterprises.
__label__Evidence	humans shouldn't colonize space until we learn to care for earth
__label__Evidence	we need to explore space so we can find minerals that are getting depleted on our planet
__label__Evidence	subsidizing space exploration is a positive move to help advance our space program.
__label__Evidence	we have too many problems here on our own planet to worry about putting money into searching space.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize space exploration because it is beneficial for educational purposes
__label__Evidence	The natural resources on earth are dwindling, we have to subsidize space exploration in order to find an outlet for this horrifying situation.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is vital to the future of humanity, when we destroy this planet, we will need to have an alternative
__label__Evidence	space exploration is the last great frontier for scientific discovery and should be publicly funded.
__label__Evidence	space exploration gives insight into our world and other planets which could be invaluable.
__label__Evidence	space exploration advances the frontiers of mankind, and could well discover new resources that will be invaluable due to the depletion of those on earth.
__label__Evidence	the future of the human race will rely on moving to other planets in the future therefore we need to subsidize space exploration to speed up research.
__label__Evidence	we should be concentrating on and spending money on making our world a better place then out exploring other worlds and space needlessly.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a drain on money which should be invested in looking after our own planet, therefore, we should not subsidize space explorations.
__label__Evidence	in times of austerity, no government can afford the costly exercise of subsidising space exploration.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is an extravagance in this era of poverty and injustice, we should concentrate government money on those areas instead.
__label__Evidence	the future of mankind may depend on the ability to travel in space
__label__Evidence	space exploratin gives us an advantage over other countries such as satellite usage to target enemy combatants and nuclear arsenals.
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize space exploration because that money could be spend on much more pressing matters like helping the homeless and research into cures for cancer.
__label__Evidence	it costs too much money to explor space, it could be used elsewhere to benefit humans
__label__Evidence	Space exploration is expensive and money should not be wasted on something that will probably never improve life on earth.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is already being funded and if a private business is interested in it they've got to pay for it
__label__Evidence	space exploration should be privatized and maybe we'd get somewhere.
__label__Evidence	The government is already in debt and subsidizing space exploration is not necessary.
__label__Evidence	there are already too many problems in the world that could use the resources more than space.
__label__Evidence	We should not subsidize space exploration as there are far more important and urgent issues to deal with on earth at this time.
__label__Evidence	we need to find a new planet with resources before we use ours up, putting more into space exploration would help accomplish this.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is invaluable because it may help us to find solutions for global warming or even planets that can sustain human life.
__label__Evidence	by subsidizing space exploration we can work toward colonizing other planets and reduce over population on earth.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is an expensive vanity project and subsidization could be abused by military and private interests.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a good adventure. our planet is in a future risk of extinct and we should best prepare our refuge in space exploration
__label__Evidence	science is important and can be beneficial to society.
__label__Evidence	there are many more practical realms of scientific inquiry that need our support more urgently.
__label__Evidence	Space exploration is important. We need a solution to the population, environment, energy and natural resources problems we face on Earth.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize space exploration because we're running out of resources on earth. space is filled with infinite resources. if we're not first, other countries will benefit while we're left behind.
__label__Evidence	many of the technological advances brought about by space exploration have eventual benefits for society in general.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a waste of time and money and we should focus on sustaining earth
__label__Evidence	Space exploration should be subsidized because the information learned from it could provide useful to our planet.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is needed to further our nations scientific knowledge. it should be supported by government. there is no profit in it but is vital to our nation and should be undertaken with public dollars.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is needed to see how space can affect us here
__label__Evidence	the space exploration can be private and get money from private funds, why should we keep it?
__label__Evidence	space exploration may be of tremendous benefit to mankind but isn't practical for private enterprise to fund because of the enormous costs involved
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize something like space exploration because it would put lives at risk.
__label__Evidence	space exploration should be subsidized as it will benefit us in the future with technology advancements.
__label__Evidence	Subsidies are a zero sum game, by subsidizing space exploration we are neglecting more important fields such as education or affordable housing.
__label__Evidence	space exploration should not be subsidized because it is not affordable. there is not enough money available in mostcountries to even support health care and security without space exploration too.
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize space exploration since that is a waste of money.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is such a costly exercise that subsidising would put an enormous strain on any country's finances that can be ill afforded when there are so many more causes that need supporting on earth.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is too costly and there aren't enough tangible benefits to justify subsidization
__label__Evidence	space exploration costs too much money that could be spent on better thing such as helping the poor in society.
__label__Evidence	the country needs to be prepared against other countries that use space exploration to advance both offensive and defensive strategies
__label__Evidence	space exploration need only be done by the private sector.
__label__Evidence	developments in science and technology have been accomplished through space exploration
__label__Evidence	the technology we get from space exploration alone is worth the cost of it
__label__Evidence	the country only has a certain amount of money, and it would be used better to help people here on earth than to explore space.
__label__Evidence	from exploring other planets we can learn more about our own.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is important for the development and growth of human society and knowledge and should be invested in by the government.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't subsidize space exploration because it can be very costly
__label__Evidence	Space exploration is a field which the private sector is fully capable to fulfill, as Elon Musk shows us.
__label__Evidence	space mining could help us find valuable minerals that are useful
__label__Evidence	we need to continue to explore space as it is part of our world.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a bottomless money pit that completely fails to justify the enornomous quantity of revenue pumped into it.
__label__Evidence	we just don't have enough excess funds yo support this type of exploration.
__label__Evidence	The technology developed for space exploration has also had uses in regular life -- subsidizing space exploration would also have positive trickle down effects.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing space exploration is extremely expensive and takes money away from projects that need it now.
__label__Evidence	space exploration provided scientific discoveries that were not thought of before
__label__Evidence	space exploration technology can lead to benefits here on earth. the ballpoint pen was invented by a space program and now people everywhere use them!
__label__Evidence	there are more immediate needs here on earth, there's no reason to explore space. we have to care for what we have already.
__label__Evidence	space exploration isn't necessary so the money could go to much more useful things such as education for children and providing health care for people.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is not yielding anything useful to society and should not be subsidized.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize space exploration to find what information is available in our solar system.
__label__Evidence	the money spent on subsidizing space exploration could be better spent on other things that help all of society
__label__Evidence	the money used on space exploration could be used on alternative initiatives such as an health and combating poverty.
__label__Evidence	we should because we can still learn so much about space.
__label__Position	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency
__label__Evidence	Maize biogas plants need more energy to operate than they supply. Should a free-area PV plant have a ten-fold higher efficiency on this arable land, the biogas plant should not be supported.
__label__Position	Every young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least
__label__Evidence	If young Europeans are living abroad they will feel racism on their own in the country they are living in.
__label__Evidence	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.
__label__Evidence	If young Europeans are living abroad they will feel racism on their own in the country they are living in.
__label__Evidence	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.
__label__Position	The EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation
__label__Evidence	Ukraine will move forward on its European path when it allows Hungarian kids living on its territory to study in their native tongue, not a day sooner.
__label__Position	Kids' reality shows should be banned
__label__Evidence	Reality shows give opportunity for children to bring out their hidden talents and to train their skills. It gives them a sense of purpose and direction from a very young age. The present education system doesn’t include other career options such as singing, acting, dancing, games, etc. Reality shows closes this loophole in the education system.
__label__Evidence	Reality shows put enormous pressure on participants to perform well every time. Children cannot handle this stress, and this may cause mental health issues. Almost all reality shows involve the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Facing defeat in front of everyone is not that easy for children. This may put an emotional toll on children.
__label__Evidence	These days, many songs and dances in movies are not supposed to be seen by children. Singing and dancing to these obscene songs will exploit children’s innocence and creates confusion in their minds.
__label__Position	Experimenting on Animals is fair
__label__Evidence	We have no right to suffer animals, even though there are benefits for us.
__label__Evidence	Tests can be done on human volunteers with their consent. But animals are forced to take tests with no choice.
__label__Position	We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology
__label__Position	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed
__label__Evidence	Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).
__label__Position	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__Evidence	Nothing illustrates to me more the fall of European ethics than pro-abortion arguments. Nobody can dispute that a baby in the womb is alive and human, and yet people call their killing a 'human right'. How could we fall so low?
__label__Evidence	Juridical protection of dignity, right to life, and integrity of every human being from conception are of fundamental importance for the future of Europe. The dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle vs Greenpeace case, which recalls the definition of the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit that presuppose the destruction of human embryos.
__label__Evidence	We are all here to fight the prohibition of eugenic practices such as abortion which organize and consequently encourage the preventive elimination of individuals who do not comply with the social, medical, and family criteria set by the ideal of man. What a perfect 21st century!
__label__Evidence	From the Association Christian in Democracy (Spain), we are clear that life is the greatest good of a society and as such must be protected from its conception to its natural end. For this reason, it should be part of the European Union's charter of fundamental rights and be protected from attacks against defenseless human beings, such as in the cases of abortion and euthanasia.
__label__Evidence	The defense of the equality of value and dignity of each and every single human life is decisive for the future of Europe.
__label__Evidence	Direct democracy is too open to manipulation by populists and malefactors via social media. A transparent representative democracy with a solid lid on lobbyism is to be preferred.
__label__Position	Marital rape should be criminalized in India
__label__Evidence	Consensual sex can also be termed as rape if the wife is willing to file a false case. There will be no proof to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men based on the mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.
__label__Evidence	The most misused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to file a case on a husband and his family in case of dowry harassment. Many women are using this law to extort money and property from their in-laws. If the law on marital rape comes into effect, many innocent men will be at threat.
__label__Evidence	Sexual violence violates human rights, irrespective of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates against married women for using the section on their husbands. Though one can file a case under the domestic violence act for marital rape, not terming marital rape as a crime will deter the victims from filing cases. Every law on the planet is prone to be misused. That doesn’t mean that we should not have laws in order to avoid false cases.
__label__Evidence	Article 15 of Indian constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender. But the proposed law on marital rape in the petitions recognizes only female victims. Hence it is discriminatory to male victims.
__label__Evidence	Punishing men based on mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.
__label__Evidence	IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates married women from using the section on their husbands.
__label__Position	We should stop using cash
__label__Evidence	A cashless economy saves so much money for governments because printing money, and sending the money to banks requires money and human resources. The need to purchase or rent land for ATMs will also be eliminated. International payments will also be easier because there is no need to exchange currency.
__label__Evidence	Cashless transactions leave digital footprints of financial transactions. They can be used to trace illegal activities.
__label__Evidence	COVID Pandemic increased the number of cashless transactions. They can prevent the spread of contagious diseases.
__label__Evidence	Cashless transactions are recorded by banks. So, the data will reveal the critical data of people regarding where they spend money. The government can easily access the data of anyone. It may result in mass surveillance programs. This goes against the right to privacy. Cash gives us anonymity.
__label__Evidence	A cashless economy will increase the number of cybercrimes.
__label__Evidence	Technical issues in banking can halt access to our money. This can interfere with our daily lives.
__label__Position	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__Evidence	No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget. And until the democratic deficit and other systemic problems in the EU are fixed, it's good that the budget is kept at 1-2% of the total EU GDP.

__label__Position	We should restrict immigration.
__label__Evidence	First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.
__label__Evidence	Take as example airplanes - how so, that it is so common to be able to search for tickets using one of many webpages or apps, but we actually cannot do the same for trains? Trains are more ecological.
__label__Evidence	There are countries like Greece to which to my knowledge is no train connection from other EU countries at all. That should be a top priority for the EU!
__label__Evidence	This would help to plan the most efficient and economical itinerary

__label__Evidence	It has to work like with air travel: Book a coherent journey from A to B operated by different companies, and be sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (rebooking, ...).
__label__Position	Triple Talaq should be abolished
__label__Evidence	Triple Talaq is a provision in Islamic personal law that allows men to divorce their wives by saying Talaq three times. Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination, and the right to live with dignity because this provision is available only for men and not women. Women are subjected to live in fear of being unilaterally divorced by their husbands. This violates their right to live with dignity.
__label__Evidence	Triple talaq should happen in three stages with time gaps. This allows time for reconciliation and arbitration. As instant divorce is a misuse of triple talaq, banning the provision itself is not the solution.
__label__Evidence	Triple Talaq does not follow Quranic guidelines of discussion, arbitration to settle disputes, witnesses to divorce, the specified time period to reconcile, or even a genuine attempt to resolve differences.
__label__Evidence	It is part of their faith and personal laws can’t be challenged. Article 25 (i) of Indian constitution provides freedom of religion.
__label__Position	We should stop immigration.
__label__Position	The European Union should visible on the facades of the embassies and consulates of European countries.
__label__Evidence	The European flag should be systematically displayed, in addition to the national flag, on any facade of an embassy or consulate of a European country. This would enhance the image of the European Union in addition to synergies like the pooling of support services. This approach could accompany the construction of common structures and policies in the field of foreign affairs.
__label__Position	We should use available solutions to make flying more sustainable right now
__label__Position	The EU should establish a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
__label__Evidence	CBAM is a central element towards a global approach to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and to mitigate global warming
__label__Position	The current differing legal cultures of the Member States need to be developed into a common legal culture in Europe
__label__Evidence	Legal traditions are different for a reason. They are the result of centuries of organic legal evolution. They cannot be overwritten with a stroke of a pen.
__label__Evidence	It's not a good idea to pursue further enlargement. The greater the territory, the harder it is to control and keep problems from appearing. Every large empire in history fell because it grew to such size that it couldn't be properly managed and ruled over. Examples from history don't become suddenly invalid because we're living in the 21st century.
__label__Position	The Commission should remove any mention of gender and other ideology from its research funds and calls.
__label__Evidence	'Gender' is a far-left concept that has nothing to do with biology, the physical universe, and reality.
__label__Position	Adultery should be criminalized
__label__Evidence	The language barrier and a weak influence on local thinking, allow local propaganda to pass on distorted and untrue information about what is happening in the EU to their citizens. Local governments have easy work to appropriate the positive things that the EU has achieved and, conversely, seduce its own failure on 'European bureaucracy'.
__label__Position	We should deal with gender inequality
__label__Position	We should create a pan-European train company
__label__Position	We should ban algorithmic trading
__label__Evidence	algorithms may not be 100% accurate and reflect the situation in the real market
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading should be banned as it manipulates the economy to benefit stockholders.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading should be banned because it gives some people an unfair advantage.
__label__Evidence	we should continue to support algorithmic trading as it gives orders a jump start rather than waiting until the complete order has been produced.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading gives people an unfair speed advantage over the rest of the field.
__label__Evidence	if people want to use it then it is their choice
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading provides people with more opportunities when it comes to trading.
__label__Evidence	ai is the future and algorithmic trading is simply a form of ai that makes the most of trading opportunities which will be the norm in the not to distant future.
__label__Evidence	even if an algorithm can react quicker than a person, it can't predict markets accurately
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading allows for greater numbers of trades to happen, getting more people involved in the economy
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is cost effective because it is timely and accurate.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is faster and more accurate than human guesswork and so provides greater value to shareholders.
__label__Evidence	programmes will always evolve to make better use of trading practices, so holding people back from using algorithmic trading will only serve to slow down progress.
__label__Evidence	we should ban algorithmic trading because most people have no idea how it works and if it is good for them or not
__label__Evidence	algirithmic trading reduces the possibilty of error and just furthers profit for finance companies
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading allows for more timely, accurate, and efficient trading.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading can cause unnatural market movements.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading gives people an unfair advantage because they can trade so much more quickly and therefore it should be banned.
__label__Evidence	Algorithmic trading can operate 24 hours a day. While you sleep, your algorithms are making you money.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is unfair and doesn't allow for the individual to make money that doesn't have the algorithim.
__label__Evidence	Algorithmic trading allows computers to buy and sell assets suddenly and in massive quantities, creating shifts in the market and making human trading difficult.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading can be manipulated and used for nefarious reasons
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading can do a job that humans are not able to do
__label__Evidence	this helps traders make more informed decisions
__label__Evidence	unless everyone is using algorithmic trading, the system would ensure only those that had access to it would have the best chance of making money.
__label__Evidence	trading using an algorithm is more accurate, quicker, and easier.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading merely enables better decisions in investments utilising technology and intelligence
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading enables a more level playing field in the trading of shares.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading can cause rapid fluctuations in the stock market that are far beyond human control and no safeguards are implemented to stop them as well as giving unfair advantage to large-scale traders.
__label__Evidence	we should ban algorithmic trading because theres is scientic advance
__label__Evidence	if the technology exists then it should be okay to use it
__label__Evidence	"algorithmic trading gives an unfair advantage to those who have access to such technology and results in losses for the ""little guy""."
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading should be banned as the software can be hacked by criminals.

__label__Position	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming
__label__Evidence	Achieving excellence in anything takes time. Through graduation, students gain so much knowledge in the relevant field. So, it’s easier for employers to train these students for the industrial requirements.
__label__Evidence	Any skill can be learned and mastered even if we do not have a degree in that. And programming is no exception.
__label__Evidence	Even if someone has a degree in IT, they have to learn so many things to get into the IT job, because there is a gap between the industrial standards and the skills that are taught in Engineering colleges. Moreover, as technology is constantly evolving, even if someone has prepared themselves for the industrial standards in their graduation, they have to learn new technologies continuously to stay relevant in the job market. So, as the learning curve will be there even for IT students, students from non-IT backgrounds can also learn these things and can get into IT jobs.
__label__Evidence	The number of IT jobs is increasing at a rapid rate due to the tech revolution. So, there will be more jobs in the IT field. And if the recruiters are very strict about the degree, they may miss a large pool of talent, who are of a non-IT background.
__label__Evidence	Now, we have so many online course platforms through which we can learn almost any skill from experts. We can also get certificates if we pass the tests. So, as Tim Cook said a 4-year degree seems old and traditional.
__label__Evidence	In many of India’s engineering colleges, we can easily pass the subjects even if do not have much knowledge in those subjects. That is the reason many companies are not able to find suitable talent even if there are so many eligible graduates. So, the willingness to become an expert in the field is more important than a degree.
__label__Evidence	If a student from non-IT background chose to start a career in the IT field, the efforts they put into graduation will go in vain.
__label__Evidence	Even though the new programming languages are replacing the old ones, the basic concepts are the same for almost all the programming languages. So, the one who has a degree in coding will have an advantage over the student from a non-IT background.
__label__Evidence	People switch careers even after working in one field for several years because our interests do change. So, when someone can do this while having so many personal responsibilities, it is much easier for youngsters to learn a new skill.

__label__Evidence	thats what is wrong with the schools today, they took god out.
__label__Evidence	prayer should be not done in school, children are in school to learn
__label__Evidence	we should not prohibit the right to pray in schools, children can opt out if they wish so prohibiting it simply unnecessarily removes the rights of those who want to participate.

__label__Evidence	this breaks the separation between church and state and has got to stop.

__label__Evidence	The administration of justice is a member state competence. Shadowy attempts by federalist institutions to enhance their influence at the expense of the sovereign member states are contrary to the letter of the EU Treaties, counter-productive, and have contributed greatly to the crisis of the EU by alienating national institutions. This is especially the case for courts. Several member states' high courts have declared the ECJ ultra vires (acting beyond its powers). This lawlessness on the part of federalist institutions must stop with immediate effect, and we must reaffirm the principles of subsidiarity and conferral.
__label__Evidence	it would help to further unite the nations.
__label__Evidence	During the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states. Gathering the strength of the 27 member states in research and health could be a real asset for the EU and its citizens, but also for its influence overseas and its independence.
__label__Evidence	I think the problem in the EU is the incompetence to establish inventions in the market. There are lots of inventions that are made and funded by public EU research facilities brought into the market by small startups. In the end, they are picked like ripe fruits by the US or Chinese companies where the big money is made.

__label__Evidence	child actors are often exploited by the film industry and should not be used
__label__Evidence	children need to be kids and get an education.

__label__Evidence	pride parades are a way for people to come together and celebrate being themselves and shouldn't be cancelled.
__label__Evidence	we should cancel pride parades because it is not needed to show off people everything what they wanted.
__label__Evidence	pride parades do the exact opposite of what they're meant to. instead of making themselves part of the community, they're making themselves stand apart
__label__Evidence	we should not cancel pride parades because it is a right in this country to express yourself and they are doing nothing wrong.
__label__Evidence	pride parades are often have displays of almost naked people and sexual imagery.
__label__Evidence	We should not cancel pride parades simply due to freedom of expression, any group can express themselves.
__label__Evidence	pride parades are too costly to the cities that hold them in terms of police protection and permitting
__label__Evidence	cancelling pride parades would make people less aware of the lgbt movement.
__label__Evidence	pride parades are a way for people to express their individualities and rights.
__label__Evidence	pride parades should be allowed to continue as it allows people to celebrate diversity among human beings.
__label__Evidence	pride parades are a legacy of a by-gone time when equal rights for gay men and women was not on the horizon.
__label__Evidence	we should cancel pride parades as we need to stop support single groups of people as it only causes more strife.
__label__Evidence	pride parades can be flash points for trouble and a magnet for extremist groups, and consume thousands of police hours to ensure safety.

__label__Position	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__Evidence	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.
__label__Evidence	Real democracy cannot do without economic democracy. If the major decisions about our future life (investments, inventions, production) are made outside social control, then there is no real democracy. Without proper social consultation, there is no prospect for a fair Europe.
__label__Evidence	We need to strengthen citizens' trust in the European project! This requires more transparency and accountability, in particular when it comes to access to documents and democratic decision-making. The 'Better Regulation' approach of the Commission which focuses on cutting costs and burdens prioritizes business interests over general interests and should be abandoned. The European project needs to benefit the many and not the few!
__label__Evidence	Decision-making is today made unilaterally minding short-term economic interests and employers' demands. We need a social, progressive policy in the EU.
__label__Evidence	It is also very important that the EU does not destroy national progressive labor laws and social protection provisions in third-party countries via Agreements as it tried with Switzerland and the Institutional Framework Agreement.
__label__Evidence	Europe needs a proper parliament including a right to initiative combined with strong involvement of social partners, e.g. through European Social Dialogue or the partnership principle in regional funds.
__label__Evidence	We all want to see transparent, democratic, and value-based policy-making. The right to good administration is embedded in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and should guide the EU's actions.
__label__Evidence	Just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?
__label__Evidence	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!

__label__Position	We should protect the European border.
__label__Position	EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen”
__label__Evidence	Stop woke ideology introducing Orwellian newspeak!
__label__Position	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__Evidence	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate. The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country. There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes. Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.
__label__Position	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
__label__Position	E-voting brings more harm than good
__label__Position	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU
__label__Evidence	It's the same with citizens of the USA using Americans to describe themselves. Yes, technically it isn't correct, but who cares...
__label__Evidence	The only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans. This must change.
__label__Evidence	The political composition of the European Council - and therefore the EU’s political center of gravity - continuously changes during the EU political cycle, thus preventing clearer government majorities to emerge within these two European Councils.
__label__Evidence	National elections synchronization would finally make it possible to strengthen the effectiveness of the Council of the EU, by eliminating the blockages caused by the constant renewal of Ministers, which considerably slows down decision-making.
__label__Evidence	Synchronizing national elections would allow European citizens to engage in major pan-European campaigns.
__label__Position	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__Evidence	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.
__label__Position	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Evidence	Less disruption to public life, less road traffic, and less loss to our economy. As all the government staff can be used at a single time, we can also increase vigilance, and factors like black money, booth capturing, etc. can be reduced.
__label__Evidence	Holding both elections together will also mean mixing up the national issues with those of the state. The national issues would overpower the state which in turn would get less priority from the politicians.
__label__Evidence	When state elections are conducted along with the center the regional parties may get marginalized because the same party getting majority in the center may get votes in the state as well.
__label__Evidence	Frequent elections in the country will bring politicians back to the public frequently whereas cutting down on elections would mean making them lazy for the rest of the term and suddenly becoming overactive during the election year.
__label__Position	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__Evidence	The cohesion funds have become a mechanism for local oligarchs and political elites to maintain their power and influence within national contexts, thus resulting in utilizing EU funds for their own personal or political gains and withholding the benefits from the people in cities and regions.
__label__Evidence	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.
__label__Position	We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging
__label__Position	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__Evidence	it is essential that environmental concerns and sustainability are the foundation of any treaty with our European Union!
__label__Evidence	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.
__label__Evidence	Migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?
__label__Evidence	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.
__label__Evidence	Migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?
__label__Position	We should invest in nuclear energy
__label__Evidence	The EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life. To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.
__label__Position	EU needs an action plan against digital addiction
__label__Evidence	Technology brings people together when they are distant, accelerates bureaucratic procedures, it allows us to work from home or from any country in the EU or outside. It allows for an immense flow of information to be easily accessible to us. As long as people do not want to do illegal online activities, it is each person’s individual decision what to do with their own online time or how much time they might want to be online.
__label__Evidence	Forty years of UK membership in the European Union have clearly proven that it is not a good idea to conclude agreements with England.
__label__Evidence	Both, a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism are overdue.
__label__Position	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__Evidence	In fact, political NGOs advocating for any cause whatsoever should be banned from schools and kindergartens.
__label__Evidence	As Europe bears the burden of the XXth century authoritarian regimes (right and left) and saw their children ideologically possessed by fascist and communist governmental propaganda (Hitlerjugend (right) and Pioneer (left) movements), we need to limit the access of the children - as one of the most vulnerable groups of our community - to every political ideology and propagating associations.
__label__Evidence	This bill gave exclusive powers to the ‘National Investigation Agency’ (NIA). NIA can take any person into their custody under UAPA without taking prior permission from the state government. This is against the federalism, which is guaranteed by the constitution of India.
__label__Evidence	Labelling organisations as terror organisations and labelling individuals as terrorists are quite different. If a person is named as a terrorist, he/she will face social exclusion and will be devoid of livelihood opportunities even if he/she proved otherwise. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone 67% of the cases ended in acquittal, which means they are probably innocent.
__label__Evidence	If someone is booked under UAPA, the burden of proving their innocence is on them. This new amendment is enabling the government to seize their properties. Then how will they pay for legal expenses to prove their innocence, if they are falsely accused?
__label__Evidence	This will provide more police powers to the central government. The provision of naming individuals as terrorists can be misused. For example, recently several civil activists are termed as Urban Naxals. If anyone opposes the government, they will be vulnerable to be framed as terrorists. Because this amendment made it easier to label anyone as a terrorist.
__label__Evidence	There is a growing threat of lone-wolf terrorism. Lone wolf terrorists do not have any association with terrorist organizations, but they commit terror attacks alone by themselves. This new amendment to UAPA has the potential to curb lone-wolf terrorism.
__label__Evidence	To prevent the violation of human rights, four-stage scrutiny is added. Designating individuals as terrorists is not started by India. The US, European Union, and China also have this provision.
__label__Evidence	Till now, only organizations were designated as terrorist organizations, but not individuals. The loophole in this is the individuals of the banned organizations are forming new organizations and carrying out terror activities. This amendment bill for the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists, thereby terror attacks can be prevented.
__label__Evidence	There is a need to act tough on terrorism amid growing threats from terrorists. So, strengthening UAPA is necessary.
__label__Position	We should make pushbacks legal
__label__Position	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__Evidence	Refugees are forcibly displaced. They flee their country for several reasons such as violence, human rights violations, war, persecution of minorities, etc. Often they face threats to life in their home countries. They leave their homes and everything else in search of a safer place to live.
__label__Evidence	At present, many countries are refusing refugees stating that they pose an economic or security threat. Only a few countries including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Liberia are accepting most of the refugees. Some host countries are forcibly sending refugees back to their home countries stating that such as the situation in their home countries is safe. Many refugees who were sent like this went through brutal violence and some people even disappeared.
__label__Evidence	All countries should share the responsibility for refugees. Resettlement of the refugees should be done without much delay. They should be provided with skill development courses and employment opportunities to help them in living a dignified life.
__label__Evidence	A weak global response is worsening the situation of refugees. The international community should help in rebuilding the war-torn countries, where refugees are coming from, so that safe and dignified returns are possible for refugees. Refugees should not be forcibly sent to their home countries.
__label__Evidence	Many developed countries are spending so much money to protect their borders, but are not spending any money for protecting the lives of refugees. More funding is required to protect refugees.
__label__Position	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Evidence	This is especially true when we know how much alcohol is damaging the brain, in particular in the developing brain of teenagers. Also unlike cannabis, over-consumption of alcohol leads to death so I would say that this product is much more dangerous. Yet unlike cannabis, alcohol is legal.
__label__Evidence	In France, political repression fueled by rightwing ideology and ignorance led cities like Marseille to develop rampant crime that fed on the lucrative market of cannabis. Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing.
__label__Evidence	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.
__label__Evidence	Today, cannabis repression is simply a political posture aimed to target rightwing voters, not a rational policy.
__label__Evidence	Whenever you find yourself in crisis, and the EU is in crisis, it is a good idea to return to core business. And in the case of the EU, the core business is economy, trade, and security. That's where the focus should be.
__label__Evidence	The more dynamic the economy, the stronger the innovation and worldwide influence the EU will have, including soft power.
__label__Evidence	The Covid-19 pandemic showed us that the European Union is not able to come up with technological innovations that could strengthen our economic position.
__label__Position	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing
__label__Evidence	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU. The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU. Almost all people are without a useful education. There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.

__label__Evidence	Horrible idea. Next, you will limit water or air?! This is not the way to move on climate change. You can do much more via mass politics and not focus on individuals or limit their freedoms. If you want to stop eating meat, do so, I won't.
__label__Evidence	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced. When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.
__label__Evidence	No, this is a horrible idea to force people to go vegan. While I agree that we, as a society, are eating too much meat, which is bad for both the environment and our health, this will only create tension and anger towards the EU.
__label__Evidence	I have no illusions that rich and influential people will find a way to get as much meat as they want and then distribute it on the black market.
__label__Evidence	The government does not have any right to use the taxpayer's money to propagandize the people to encourage what to eat and not to eat. It is not the responsibility of the government.
__label__Evidence	I think forcing people to eat a limited amount of meat is totally the wrong way because of the following reasons: 1. It would cause so much more bureaucracy 2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat? 3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.

__label__Evidence	The EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off.
__label__Position	Food whose production has been subsidized with EU funds should not be allowed to be exported to developing countries.
__label__Evidence	The subsidies were originally intended to ensure the security of supply for the European population. But when you export subsidized food, it's at the expense of European taxpayers. Export yes, but then no more subsidies for these products.
__label__Evidence	These products come mainly from large enterprises, which do not necessarily focus on environmental protection.
__label__Evidence	Subsidies often make farmers in recipient countries uncompetitive, hampering local production and increasing migratory pressure.
__label__Evidence	This will add to the transparency and fair competition. Insincere employers shouldn't have an advantage, and in essence, it would be beneficial for all EU members, not just the workers.
__label__Evidence	Protection of the rights of those who actually produce the services and products that constitutes the European market is nothing but self-evident. With a more and more integrated EU, ignoring those rights will create fragmentation and conflicts.

__label__Position	There should be a stronger EU on the world scene
__label__Evidence	Too many times so-called leaders around the world like Trump and Boris Johnson have made a mockery of Europe and Europeans with zero response from EU leaders. These things affect people's pride and give out a sense of weakness.
__label__Evidence	We have already done great damage to EU credibility by pointless posturing.
__label__Evidence	EU should show more strength when dealing with foreign powers. In addition, there should be a vision about where we want to go in the long term with the EU, and this is in an increasingly complex (and sometimes hostile) world.
__label__Position	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory

__label__Evidence	Reality shows give opportunity for children to bring out their hidden talents and to finess their skills.

__label__Evidence	Almost all reality shows involves the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Facing defeat infront of everyone is not that easy for children. This may put an emotional toll on children.

__label__Position	The EU must be confederal and not federal
__label__Evidence	We need a real and effective European democracy, therefore, a European Federation.

__label__Evidence	too many people fight and cause wars through religion so it should be banned in favor of atheism
__label__Evidence	people have the freedom to religion and forcing them to chose a non religious entity is unconstitutional.
__label__Evidence	All beliefs should be recognized not just the one YOU want.
__label__Evidence	we should not because everyone needs something to believe in and if there was no religion then people may not follow laws because there is no consequences of bad actions (hell)
__label__Evidence	atheism is a legitimate belief system that allows a person to think for himself and figure life out in his own way. it should be adopted the same as other belief systems are adopted.

__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism because science can explain how we got here without needing a god to explain it.
__label__Evidence	this country was founded on christian principles; we cannot abandon these customs.
__label__Evidence	fewer wars will arise since there will be no fighting over holy lands or differing religions.
__label__Evidence	atheism could be of great benefit because it would foster more scientific ideas which could prevent our demise from global warming and other looming challenges

__label__Evidence	Atheism should be the norm for a society who wants to live according to their own rules and ideals.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt atheism because it is not a religion
__label__Evidence	anyone is entitled to believe in whatever they want, god or no god
__label__Evidence	atheism will destroy the world by unleashing godless people running the government with no morals or ethics and should not be adopted.

__label__Evidence	atheism would take away religious hatred and wars which have caused a huge amount of damage throughout history.
__label__Evidence	there is no actual proof that god exists. it is all stories passed down no matter which religion. atheism would stop the fighting over which religion is superior.
__label__Evidence	the right to practice religion is a personal freedom that cannot be taken away as it is a source of comfort to many.

__label__Evidence	there are a lot of religions that take advantage of people. atheism eliminates that from happening.

__label__Evidence	atheism allows for an even playing field, removes the fighting over which religion is superior over another.
__label__Evidence	we are a nation founded on christianity so atheism goes against our natural beginnings.
__label__Evidence	no belief or religion should be instituted in a blanket form. people are completely different with very different beliefs. no one way is good for everyone. there should be freedom to believe whatever one wants.
__label__Evidence	no one has ever been able to prove that god exists. religions convince people of a higher power to get them into church for their own profit,
__label__Evidence	atheism is simply the end result of rational thinking, refusing to blindly believe in things that are unproven - this is healthier attitude, since religious adherence leads to all mannor of intolerance.
__label__Evidence	everyone has a right to believe in anything and follow the religion they think it's most suited for them, so we cannot impose atheism
__label__Evidence	atheism should be the defacto standard for all people. If individuals choose to believe in unprovable, invisible super beings from space, it should be kept private and out of official/public spaces.
__label__Evidence	religion has been responsible for some much war and suffering since the dawn of human history, it is time to abandon it completely.
__label__Evidence	religion has been the root cause of more pain and bloodshed throughout history than anything else - an atheist approach is a healthier way of life than rigid, deathly adherence to a divisive doctrine.

__label__Evidence	people are guided by religion on how to conduct their live and its been around for thousands of years

__label__Evidence	religion has been used as justification for many terrible things in the past. we should base our judgements only on what we know s true, and not what might be true.

__label__Evidence	Europe should represent its own interests.

__label__Evidence	In order to improve the protection of the environment, the use of fresh pulp should no longer be allowed for toilet paper.
__label__Position	We should promote a culture of exchange and sharing of goods and services
__label__Position	Companies should fight moonlighting
__label__Evidence	Some people moonlight to pursue their passion when the earnings from their passion cannot replace the salary from their main job. Several entrepreneurs take this route and leave their jobs once they earn enough from their new ventures.
__label__Evidence	As per a study published by the Academy of Management Journal in 2021, moonlighting can provide a sense of control and motivation, which can improve the productivity of employees.
__label__Evidence	The sudden layoffs by several companies especially during the pandemic caused fear in many employees. And hence several people took up side gigs or a second job as a safety net in case they are laid off.
__label__Evidence	Moonlighting can help in upskilling. A few people want to learn new skills apart from what they are working on in their primary job. This can help them in developing expertise in their field. Some might get bored with monotonous jobs and hence take up second jobs to learn new skills and thereby make their days exciting.
__label__Evidence	Companies fear information and sensitive data theft and the possibility of sharing it with their rival companies.
__label__Evidence	Some managers are worrying that the employees who moonlight may not be productive in their primary job due to fatigue and increased stress. There are also concerns about working for other companies during the office hours of my primary job.
__label__Evidence	In general, companies provide several benefits to employees such as provident fund, health insurance, etc. So, they feel it is unfair when their employees focus their energy and time on a second job, which doesn’t provide any of those benefits.
__label__Position	Europe should protect bees
__label__Evidence	We must protect our Planet, and without bees, wasps, or other arthropods, we go to our own extinction!
__label__Evidence	Without bees, which are dying en masse, Europe’s existence is impossible. The problem is complex and it is about the influence of poisonous pesticides and other agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as the influence of GSM technologies, which lead to overheating of the bee’s body, which falls under the negative impact of microwaves. Therefore, Europe must create a series of policies to help bees survive in the name of the surplus of European nations.
__label__Position	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__Evidence	If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia. In order to support them we need a European army and a common foreign policy.
__label__Position	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state
__label__Evidence	The EU should support democracies rather than dictatorships and value the support of democracy over economic gains.
__label__Evidence	China is acting against European values and violating intellectual property rights.
__label__Evidence	Recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state coordinated act of the EU, USA, Japan, and Australia. That will make any retaliation from China much more difficult.
__label__Position	Pay-as-you-go public health insurance funds should only be used for the most serious illnesses
__label__Evidence	This only works if you're young and healthy, otherwise, you're a bad risk for private health insurance and it will become even more expensive
__label__Evidence	They are good time managers. As most of the women today manage work and home, they can prioritize their time well.
__label__Evidence	In general, they've coherent minds, are punctual and are dedicated to their work. These inbuilt qualities do make them better managers than men.
__label__Evidence	It is important to see immigrants as people who have a culture, a religious perspective, and a very different but respectable idea of sociality compared to the European one. That's why we must act in a coordinated and careful manner between institutions and organizations.
__label__Evidence	Such a hub could also have a bridging role between local necessities and opportunities at the EU level, such as project funding.
__label__Evidence	The hub could also organize events to spread awareness in the local population on topics related to migration, in order to boost social inclusion processes and fight the spreading of fake news and ostracism of migrant people.
__label__Position	Bullet for Bullet is a right policy
__label__Evidence	These days, every man is considered as a potential rapist. If a woman makes a false molestation complaint against a man out of revenge or any other motive, society is more likely to believe the woman's words. Society and media exposes the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in genuine cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However the same is not true with the complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt about the genuinity of the case. What if the sexual harassment case against the man is a false case? Some people think like men can take anything. False molestation cases will result in the irreversible loss of reputation and causes mental agony to the accused and his family.
__label__Evidence	Many false domestic violence cases are being reported in India. Girl can drag their in-laws to court, but the same is not true with a boy. In many domestic violence cases, in-laws didn't even stay with couple, but are booked for 'influencing' the boy. Do girl's parents not 'influence' her? And the saddest thing is that girl can complain against her sister-in-law and sister-in-law's husband too under domestic violence, even if they are not staying at her place. Women can be as cruel as men in harassing their life partner.
__label__Evidence	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration.

__label__Position	We should take polyester and other toxic substances out of clothing and place them with natural materials
__label__Position	We should subsidize print media
__label__Evidence	There will be no sense of security. We cannot sleep peacefully because the cryptocurrency’s value keeps on fluctuating. Standard currencies fluctuate too, but not as high as cryptocurrencies. If the value of standard currency falls, we can still afford to live in our country, because the fall of currency value impacts all fields. For example, if the prices of groceries rise, so do our salaries. But if the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin falls, we will lose our hard-earned money.
__label__Evidence	The future belongs to technology. Cryptocurrencies make peer-to-peer financial transactions a lot easier. This currency can be sent from any part of the world to any part of the world. Hence there will be no struggle of exchanging currencies like Dollars for the Rupee etc. While traveling the world, there will no hurdle of exchanging our currencies with local currencies.
__label__Position	We need a better distribution of refugees.

__label__Evidence	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.
__label__Position	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
__label__Position	Europe must help Ukraine
__label__Evidence	Ukraine is infamous for its black market for weapons. Helping Ukraine by dumping weapons into such a country is folly.
__label__Position	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__Evidence	The EU needs to establish a legal means of preventing illegal migration that is encouraged by the Turkish government and by privately funded NGOs, which are acting against the interest of the EU.

__label__Position	India is safe for women
__label__Evidence	being against solar energy, in my opinion, is simply irrational. Insects also die by windmills sometimes, but much more often from hunger, birds or herbicides, insecticides, etc.
__label__Evidence	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece.
__label__Evidence	What does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate. So people actually have to come to the EU and enter the EU if they want to ask for asylum in the EU. This has caused inhumane and dangerous circumstances as we see in the Mediterranean Sea.

__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cells have already been proven to have the capability to save lives. with more research who knows how many more uses they could have in reducing illness and improving quality of life.
__label__Evidence	embryonic sten cell research goes against a variety of christian religious beliefs and should not be subsidized.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research should be subsidized because it could lead to massive changes in human beings. this type of research could reverse aging, change genes, and learn how to cure diseases.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research is playing god and is offensive to some religions.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research could lead to massive scientific break through that could save millions of lives. funding this would mean the difference of life and death to many people.
__label__Evidence	it is not scientifically necessary to use embryonic stem cells in research and some people believe their use is immoral and unethical.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research could lead to the discovery of new medical treatments that would alleviate the suffering of many people
__label__Evidence	subsidized embryonic stem cell research will advance medical science more rapidly than would otherwise be the case
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize embryonic stem cell research. we should not play god.
__label__Evidence	stem cell research is our best hope in finding cures
__label__Evidence	there is no place for embryonic stem cell research in modern society and he practice should not be encouraged through subsidization.
__label__Evidence	this will help to establish cures for disabilities and diseases
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cells can potentially save lives for many diseases such as diabetes
__label__Evidence	stem cell research may offend religious individuals
__label__Evidence	Embryonic stem cell research is unethical because it uses the bodies of unborn babies.

__label__Position	We need legal ways of migration.
__label__Evidence	Migrants have a complete lack of critical thinking.
__label__Evidence	Migrants willingly risk their lives.
__label__Evidence	Migrants depend on other countries' social systems.
__label__Evidence	Migrants sell drugs.
__label__Evidence	Migrants have a complete lack of critical thinking.
__label__Evidence	Migrants willingly risk their lives.
__label__Evidence	Migrants depend on other countries' social systems.
__label__Evidence	Migrants sell drugs.
__label__Position	There is a lack of unity in European migration policies.
__label__Evidence	For a better migration policy, a European mission could be created to welcome migrants from the coasts of Libya and Tunisia. People welcomed in the centers in North Africa will be re-distributed to the countries of the Union. Are you insane?
__label__Evidence	Hydrogen is flammable and can cause fires or explosions. So, it is not completely safe yet.
__label__Evidence	If the production of hydrogen fuel uses fossil fuels, that can be counterproductive. So, using renewable energy to produce hydrogen fuel is important.
__label__Evidence	Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles do not emit greenhouse gases. This helps to fight climate change. As many countries are opting for energy transition, clean hydrogen fuel vehicles along with other alternative fuel vehicles can pave the way to sustainable transportation. Also, as these vehicles do not emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, they can cut air pollution to a great extent.
__label__Evidence	The prices of fossil fuels are increasing continuously. So, if more hydrogen vehicles come into the market, the price of fossil fuels may reduce.
__label__Evidence	Hydrogen vehicles are much quieter than fossil fuel-based vehicles. So, they can reduce noise pollution too.
__label__Evidence	If the hydrogen fuel escapes into the air, it can increase global warming.
__label__Evidence	Turkey is encroaching on EU territory, Russia is sending its army to the Ukrainian border, and what can we do? Nothing, because nobody is taking us seriously. Our threats are empty and get ignored, and our diplomacy is weak. It's time for the EU to be recognized as a strong force that can and will protect its people and its interests.
__label__Evidence	A European army is not only needed to attack and defend but to give weight to European words.
__label__Position	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare for EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__Evidence	Ukraine is a part of Europe—geographically, diplomatically, and culturally. If Ukraine wants to join the EU, we should grant our brothers and sisters full membership in our Union.
__label__Evidence	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!
__label__Evidence	Such competitions and beauty pageant have a very wrong influence on society as we all quickly follow the media trends. All this is basically sending the wrong message to our younger generation girls where they are made to understand that being perfect and pretty is extremely necessary. This affects their self-esteem and may even cause depression.
__label__Evidence	They promote cosmetic surgeries. Women these days, are ready to spend thousands of dollars on getting hair extensions, fake teeth, botox injections, body implants, spray tans, branded outfits and makeup products. This could be extremely expensive to afford and such expenses are never-ending. Cindy Jackson, a known television star. has a world record of 52 plastic surgeries done by her. Some women can even get addicted to such practices and then theirs no look back. This is the direct influence of society's importance to beauty.
__label__Evidence	Beauty pageant can increase the objectification of women.
__label__Position	We should oppose collectivism
__label__Evidence	collectivism prevents original thoughts and discourages people from looking for their own ideas
__label__Evidence	treating everyone as a large group unit is not helpful for people who have different individual needs.

__label__Evidence	people should be encouraged to individuals
__label__Evidence	collectivism is a communist strategy and we must reject
__label__Evidence	we should support collectivism because it helps people find common goals.
__label__Evidence	people should be able to work hard and reap the benefits of their labor. with collectivism you will always have some people doing most of the work and the lazy ones will benefit from it.
__label__Evidence	collectivism and the impingement of the the government results in people blaming others for their problems rather than looking for solutions themselves
__label__Evidence	collectivism takes the focus off the individual as well as the ways in which each of us is unique. supporting collectivism means wanting the individual to remain subordinate to society.

__label__Evidence	collectivism bands people together to solve problems in their communities
__label__Evidence	collectivism looks out for everyone and leaves no one behind

__label__Evidence	Collectivism would be good in situations where it must be a group decision.
__label__Evidence	collectivism leads to a stagnant culture where new ideas are never formed and expressed
__label__Evidence	collectivism can erode personal freedoms in a way that is irreversible

__label__Evidence	collectivism gives people something to work on as a team and builds relationships.
__label__Evidence	collectivism promotes a greater sense of community where people care about each other's welfare.
__label__Evidence	collectivism too often causes the individual to suffer needlessly

__label__Evidence	We should support collectivism because many problems like climate change cannot be dealt with on an individual level.
__label__Evidence	collectivism can achieve more that individuals alone
__label__Evidence	society is a collective and the most good comes from working together
__label__Evidence	collectivism provides a common goal for everyone to work towards.

__label__Evidence	we should oppose collectivism because it creates echo chambers in societies that makes it harder for individuals to give their thoughts and opinions on things
__label__Evidence	collectivism means that everyone has equal access to facilities.
__label__Evidence	this practice does not allow an individual their own thoughts and actions.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't oppose collectivism because sometimes you have to look out for what is best for society as a whole and not how it would benefit a specific individual.
__label__Evidence	collectivism provides no incentive for people to work hard because they have no opportunity to become wealthy.
__label__Evidence	no two people are entirely alike. ignoring individual differences and needs does not best serve the whole
__label__Evidence	In a collectivist society, everyone is considerate of each another and provides support to one another.
__label__Evidence	collectivism will ultimately fail because it is at odds with basic, self-preservation.
__label__Evidence	No one individuals life is any more intrinsically important or valuable than any other person's life, and therefore we should build societies that value the collective and general public over the individual.
__label__Evidence	collectivism goes directly against the rights of individuals. individual freedom is what this country was founded on. it is rights violative to put the majority above individuals.
__label__Evidence	collectivism helps everyone accomplish things better.
__label__Evidence	with collectivism, there is less motivation to do more difficult jobs as everything has a similar pay.
__label__Evidence	we should oppose collectivism because it lessens creativity and individuality.
__label__Evidence	collectivism can achieve more than other forms of societal structure
__label__Evidence	We should support collectivism because it leads to more investment in the community and more growth in the long term.
__label__Evidence	collectivism helps to keep everyone in line since the group can ban anyone that steps out.
__label__Evidence	Collectivism as a philosophy has historically been used to commit atrocities and silence political dissent against oppressive regimes, such as in the case of Stalin's USSR.
__label__Evidence	collectivism makes sure that all are taken care of and the weak will provided for.
__label__Evidence	sometimes it's easier to get one's voice across if the voice is heard as a group
__label__Evidence	collectivism does not allow one person to stand out from the others, which can be negative
__label__Evidence	collectivism is necessary for people to help one another and endure.

__label__Evidence	collectivism encourages herd mentality
__label__Evidence	collectivism takes care of everyone and not just those at the top
__label__Evidence	We should oppose collectivism because while it can be used to help everyone, it gives too much power to the collective to hurt individuals.
__label__Evidence	collectivism gives one voice a louder voice by having others available for support
__label__Evidence	as individuals we have a right to not be grouped into one thought process.
__label__Evidence	collectivism helps encourage those who are minorities and may not be able to have luxuries others may have.

__label__Evidence	collectvism is unfair to the world and is irrational
__label__Evidence	collectivism focuses on the group as a whole and diminishes the rights of the individual.
__label__Evidence	collectivism necessarily means that individual freedoms will be reduced, so it does not make sense to adopt it.
__label__Evidence	While society and the collective may be long lasting, individuals are only afforded a single life, and therefore should prioritize that over the lives of others.
__label__Evidence	we should support collectivism, as everyone in the group benefits from this practice.
__label__Evidence	with collectivism, more social programs are established, allowing the underprivileged to get the healthcare they deserve.
__label__Evidence	collectivism ensures that everybody is taken care of

__label__Evidence	collectivism stops creativity and individual thought
__label__Evidence	collectivity, a group of people can get far more done than individually.

__label__Position	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work
__label__Evidence	It seems like a no-brainer to say something like this, but actually the way, we handle soil, must change massively to halt the climate crisis and mitigate its consequences. Thus we need to recultivate and restore abandoned and contaminated places and shift agriculture to regenerative agriculture or restoration agriculture. We need to stabilize family farms and make them ecologically, financially, and socially sustainable. We need between big and medium-sized farms and also highly productive smallholder farms and wildlife reservoirs. This all depends on a lot of labor, engaged people, and legal and conceptual infrastructure. Having all this in place will foster urban areas as well.
__label__Evidence	If rural areas are to become more attractive to live in and work, it is essential to bet on innovation and the creation of quality jobs
__label__Position	Social media is making us less social
__label__Evidence	During the covid pandemic time, social media helped people in maintaining their social life.Social media made it possible to stay connected with friends and loved ones all the time. We can easily know what is happening in their lives. It allowed us to communicate with multiple people at the same time by sharing posts.
__label__Evidence	Due to social media, now we have the opportunity to connect with many people, even if they do not live in our area. Before social media, we could interact with people from either our locality or the places we go.
__label__Evidence	By following friends on social media and not communicating with them privately, we can only know the things they post on their accounts. We may not know much about what is really happening in their lives. That means we will have no meaningful connections with friends. The convenience of contacting people online made us prefer it over meeting them outside.
__label__Evidence	A few people now have social anxiety due to not having enough face-to-face interactions. When we avoid talking to people for a long time, automatically we develop a fear to involve in small talk.
__label__Evidence	Trolling on social media is a big menace. It is affecting the self-esteem of many people and is also making them avoid forming social connections.
__label__Evidence	In the book “iGen”, it was mentioned that in the next decade we may see more young people who know just the right emoji for a situation — but not the right facial expression. This can become true if we prefer virtual life over real life.
__label__Evidence	Through close-knit communities or micro-communities based on shared interests on social media along with private messaging, social media gave us an opportunity to build real connections with people we can really relate to.
__label__Position	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
__label__Evidence	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity. It would turn Europe into a polarized entity much like the American system and would firmly divide the European community on every issue.
__label__Evidence	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will only serve larger nations in the union and small member states would lose all their power and slowly turn into puppets of the larger nations instead of equal partners
__label__Evidence	Changing the EU foreign policy voting procedure will cause serious problems.
__label__Evidence	Giving small countries 'veto rights' is a recipe for disaster that will keep the European Union separated and weak instead of united and reliable in policy making.
__label__Position	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__Position	Alternative medicine should be more accepted
__label__Evidence	Traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine is a safe and efficient way to improve well-being, and happiness and prevent illness. Also, an innumerable amount of people have got significant palliation or even total cure in cases, which the official health care system, unfortunately, couldn't help. This is clearly an area, where countries, civilizations, and schools of thought could learn a lot from each other.
__label__Evidence	A direct election of a European president is a travesty of democracy. It would be only a mediatic competition among 'plastic' leaders. Something very similar to The Simulacra (Dick's 1964 science fiction novel). We are not a 'nation', we are a confederation of nations.
__label__Evidence	I don't think the EU needs the same problem as France where the elections are just about which guy people should select and which candidate looks the best to handle the position.
__label__Evidence	What will the Europeans think if the candidates are always, for each election, either French, German, or maybe Spanish, and neither coming from small countries?
__label__Evidence	To have a chance that one candidate (with a good chance to win) comes from your own country, I think people from little countries can wait 40 years. This will definitely destroy the European belonging feeling you want to promote with this idea.
__label__Position	We need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto.
__label__Evidence	If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, e.g. in France where English is being thought in French. language.
__label__Evidence	We have already English as a language of exchange.
__label__Evidence	English is ideal as it is spoken internationally as the language of commerce, travel, and political exchange. Esperanto isn't.
__label__Evidence	If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, e.g. in France where English is being thought in French. language.
__label__Evidence	We have already English as a language of exchange.
__label__Evidence	English is ideal as it is spoken internationally as the language of commerce, travel, and political exchange. Esperanto isn't.

__label__Evidence	people have a right to be able to defend themselves and their loved ones
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is enshrined in the constitution and cannot be infringed on or revoked - this would dilute the importance and sanctity of other doctrines.

__label__Evidence	gun violence is out of control and the only solution is to take away guns
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is one of the tenets of our country
__label__Evidence	Citizens should be allowed to defend themselves with lethal force in a life-or-death situation because the police are typically slow to respond to such situations.
__label__Evidence	everyone should have the right to keep and bear arms for protection
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms should be abolished because countries with strict gun control are far safer because they have far fewer incidents of violent gun crime
__label__Evidence	the right to bear arms had and will only lead to people killing innocent people.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms because people would be left defenseless against criminals who are going to find a way to get a gun
__label__Evidence	guns are already ubiquitous and outlawing them will only keep them out of the hands of lawful owners.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is important in keeping people safe in a dangerous and uncertain world
__label__Evidence	it is a fundamental right of american citizens to keep and bear arms and to remove that right would simply drive arms trading underground.

__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms has enabled the death of many innocent people - including small children. it is time to move on.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is an constitutional right that needs to be upheld.
__label__Evidence	not having an armed public would entice the government to become more tyrannical.
__label__Evidence	with the wave of mass shootings that have occurred the world would be a much safer place without guns.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms because people have a right to defend themselves if someone has the intention of harming you or breaking into your house.
__label__Evidence	not allowing guns would help to keep crime down
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is a totally outdated constitutional bedrock that underpins horrifically high rates of gun crime.
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms as we have a right to defend ourselves given by the constitution.
__label__Evidence	we need to stop all the shootings that are happening and abolishing the right to keep and bear arms is a good start
__label__Evidence	guns are much too dangerous and often get in the wrong hands
__label__Evidence	weapons are very tentative to commit a crime or create a vendetta against another person, that is why it is important to abolish the possession and carrying of arms.
__label__Evidence	Arms are very bad for the whole of society when they are in the hands of bad persons. giving anyone the right to keep and bear arms puts society in danger
__label__Evidence	america far and away has the highest gun related homicides of any developed nation, to say nothing of the multiple mass shootings per year.
__label__Evidence	there are too many incidents of people getting shot either by accident or because people shoot first and ask questions later or even people suddenly becoming unhinged and going on shooting sprees.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms because innocent people get killed
__label__Evidence	there have been too many terrible shootings where the perpetrator has found it easy to amass weapons. making th is harder may limit these shootings.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms because too many guns get into the hands of kids
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms since it leads to more violence and higher crime rights.
__label__Evidence	there is no need to carry a fire arm it just leads to more people doing the same
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is antiquated as it was utilized to form militia's during times of conflict and war and is no longer necessary.
__label__Evidence	there is no rational purpose for arming the populace; it causes more problems than it solves.
__label__Evidence	in a dangerous society, surely a person has the right to protect themselves and their family - this was the initial reasoning behind enshrining 'the right to keep and bear arms', and nothing has changed.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is the bedrock constitutional right of every person both to protect themselves and their families, and banning this would infringe on civil liberties.
__label__Evidence	there are many people killed every year by guns that were improperly secured
__label__Evidence	there is too much gun violence, and too many innocent people are dying.
__label__Evidence	if the right to keep and bear arms was abolished, it would decrease the number of weapons that are available and lessen violent crime.

__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is putting everyone in danger and making mass-shootings more easily done.
__label__Evidence	the right to bear arms is enshrined in the second amendment and must not be violated
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms as this is our fundamental right and should not be something for debate.
__label__Evidence	Guns are designed to kill people, we should be doing everything possible to destroy them and stop their production to save lives, allowing people to keep and bear arms does the absolute opposite of this.
__label__Evidence	everyone should be able to bear arms in order to protect themselves, their homes and their families.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. that law was established before guns became deadly machines.
__label__Evidence	if the right to keep and bear arms were abolished would be taking away another fundamental right of americans and this cannot happen.
__label__Evidence	the average person has no reason to need a firearm, and most people aren't competent enough to be trusted with something so dangerous.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is a constitutional right and provides comfort and safety for families who use them responsibly.
__label__Evidence	we should keep the right to keep and bear arms to protect ourselves from dangerous situations and to keep our homes and our families safe.
__label__Evidence	Keeping and bearing arms is dangerous because accidents happen and people could die needlessly.
__label__Evidence	it is dangerous to have a community where so many people have lethal weapons
__label__Evidence	we can't arbitrarily overturn a constitutional amendment.
__label__Evidence	gun ownership is a personal right and a form of personal protection in an ever-increasingly hostile and dangerous world.

__label__Evidence	if people are denied the right to bear arms, they take away their right to feel protected, especially when your country shows that they are not capable of doing so.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms was a concept born in age-old frontier days, where violence and threats were widespread - it has no relevance now in a modern society, and simply perpetuates crime.
__label__Evidence	Gun ownership only breeds more violence. Guns sold on the consumer market today are inexcusably far too powerful for mere self-defense purposes.
__label__Evidence	Gun violence is a huge problem and there are too many mass shootings. If people didn't have guns many lives would be saved. Less suicides would happen too as guns are just too easy to use.

__label__Position	India should accept Rohingya refugees
__label__Evidence	India is the second most populous country in the world. It is already difficult for the Indian government to provide food security and basic necessities to all the people of India. Adding more burden to this will worsen the situation.
__label__Evidence	Accommodating refugees will cause resettling of some Indians. The Indian government tried to give shelter to Rohingyas by resettling some in the Jammu region. This may not be the right step and will cause distress to the resettled Indians.
__label__Evidence	Rohingyas have their own set of ethnicity and culture. By accepting them, we will just be adding more culture to the already-vast culture of India.
__label__Evidence	Letting the Rohingya go back to the place where they do not get recognition means more loss of human lives, and to a greater extent. The population of the Rohingya is 1.1 million, and if the violence and torture continues on them, then there will be no person left in the community.
__label__Evidence	Acceptance of the Rohingyas will definitely throw a good impression of the hospitality of our country to the foreign land. This will improve India’s chances to secure permanent membership in United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
__label__Evidence	Accepting refugees escaping from death situations is surely an act of humanity. Rohingya people have been treated brutally by the Burmese government due to racism. Being a neighboring country, we should be accepting those people who are in deep distress.
__label__Evidence	Allowing refugees is a potential security threat to any country. Refugees can be an easy prey to terrorists. They may take advantage of the situation and may carry out illegal activities using refugees.
__label__Evidence	India has always been kind to refugees. Hence, the same spirit should be continued in the case of Rohingya community.
__label__Evidence	Accepting refugees escaping from death situations is surely an act of humanity. Rohingya people have been treated brutally by the Burmese government due to racism. Being a neighboring country, we should be accepting those people who are in deep distress.
__label__Position	Entrapment should be legalized
__label__Position	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__Evidence	Fear of the unknown is normal behavior. It has saved our race since ages starting when mankind was a simple monkey among others.
__label__Evidence	Additionally when fear is reinforced by facts like increased violence in every country with a high number of immigrants, and rapes of women it is not a problem of 'perception' but a simple reality.

__label__Position	We need to develop partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)
__label__Evidence	The European Union should be a haven of togetherness and humanity.
__label__Evidence	The migration pressure from Africa towards Europe results from a significant difference in perceived quality of life. It is in the interest of the EU and its member states to reduce that difference by working with the AU to level up and develop African nations.

__label__Evidence	It reduces financial burden, because there is no need to buy many clothes.
__label__Evidence	It would be smarter and cheaper to develop and encourage limited speed, low consumption shared thermal cars, and abandon the myth of owning a car.
__label__Evidence	most of the electric power is produced by thermal power plants that burn oil derivatives and by the nuclear industry. So, until the electric power generation won't be mostly by renewable energies, is basically irrelevant which kind of cars are we using.
__label__Evidence	It's by no means irrelevant what kind of cars people use; 25% renewable + 25% nuclear + 50% combustible is better than 100% combustible gasoline.
__label__Evidence	non-gasoline cars improve local air quality on city streets.
__label__Position	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU
__label__Evidence	Agreed. Only if we show that criminals don't have a place in the EU, we can convince our citizens that refugees aren't that much of a threat. Making the checking process that each refugee has to go through public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can just come here and we need to close our borders.
__label__Evidence	Not only for committing, but also planning. Especially if an immigrant gets caught planning a terrorist act, he/she must be removed from EU permanently.
__label__Evidence	I agree, no one should migrate to a country if they're going to commit a crime.

__label__Evidence	It is necessary to make Europe Day on May 9th a holiday day. It should replace the respective national holiday of a member country.
__label__Position	The EU should start accession negotiations with Russia
__label__Evidence	Russia in the EU? No, thanks!
__label__Position	We need a better distribution of refugees
__label__Evidence	The dividing of refugees is a long-discussed plan. But in the end, no involved group agreed with these plans. Some countries do not like these people at all.
__label__Evidence	The key to successful immigration depends upon the possibility of employment. So EU members are to decide whom they want to admit.
__label__Evidence	Illegal immigrants have to be returned to UN refugee camps.

__label__Position	We need to build up European Defence while remaining in NATO
__label__Evidence	Europe’s sovereignty and credibility are at this price. The burden of European defense cannot rest on the back of a small number of countries and potential conflicts are increasing.
__label__Position	Payday loans should be banned
__label__Evidence	US treaties with Mexico won't let them build anything on the Rio Grande River and the areas around it. Furthermore, most of the areas along the border in Texas are privately owned which leaves a large part of the border uncovered. So, building the wall is not going to bring any change.
__label__Evidence	There is a fairly good chance that the wall is never going to make it up. Projects like these take a large amount of time to complete and if in the next Presidential elections, any other person gets elected, there will be more chances of him/her stopping the construction of the wall.
__label__Evidence	According to the reports, illegal crossing of the borders has actually decreased from the year 2014 to 2015 which renders no use in building the wall.
__label__Evidence	we should not do this because other countries like china already did and it caused an epidemic where there is a huge imbalance of males to females which disrupts the population
__label__Evidence	gender selection is essentially playing god.
__label__Evidence	sex selection is the perfect solution to a family that has a history of all one gender. many families want the perfect one and one so it's perfect for those as well. it's a win no matter how you look.
__label__Evidence	sex selection can lead to an over abundance of a favored gender in society
__label__Evidence	we should legalize sex selection because the parents are free to decide what gender they want
__label__Evidence	when we allow abortion for any reason or purpose, sex selection cannot be excluded. in fact illegal sex selection only increased abortions as the alternative method to select gender
__label__Evidence	parents should be able to choose what sex child they are going to have.
__label__Evidence	allowing sex selection could lead to an imbalance of the genders in the population.
__label__Evidence	parents have every right to decide whether they give birth to a boy or a girl.
__label__Evidence	sex selection should not be legalized as it is unethical
__label__Evidence	sex selection is unnatural and will have long term negative consequences on society. we will become overpopulated with male children and females will become targets of sexual crimes.
__label__Evidence	There is no certainty that the process will be a success, and couples may end up wasting time and money.
__label__Evidence	this should be banned as it is immoral.
__label__Evidence	sex selection should be allowed to those who want a certain gender.
__label__Evidence	when people mess with mother nature by trying to select the sex of their child, only bad things can happen.
__label__Evidence	sex selection promotes abortion and gender inequality
__label__Evidence	We should not legalize sex selection as this is playing god and can open the door to a raft of other genetic selection that is not thoroughly tested.
__label__Evidence	We should legalize sex selection because a ban leads to dangerous back alley procedures, and to more abortions and female infanticide
__label__Evidence	sex is determined at birth and not something a person should be allowed to change or decide for themselves.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't legalize sex selection because some people can't have children at all, they should be happy that they have blessed with a miracle. if you want to choose a sex then foster or adopt a certain sex
__label__Evidence	sex selection is playing god, will create gender imbalances and create negative stereotypes concerning male/female preferences.
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize sex selection because when we do, we are messing with god's will.
__label__Evidence	In societies where sex selection happens, men are favored over women, resulting in a lopsided sex ratio. This leads to many men being unable to wed.
__label__Evidence	sex selection should be legal for parents to select the sex of the child. parents with all boys or all girls should have the choice of selecting the other sex.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing sex selection will lead to numerous healthy babies being aborted just because they are not the sex that the parents desire.
__label__Evidence	it will result in more elective abortions and cause a gender imbalance
__label__Evidence	sex selection should be a choice for parents to make and therefore should be legalized.
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize sex selection because this goes against the natural laws of nature.
__label__Evidence	sex selection is a choice between parents and their doctor; if the parents insist on having a boy to, say, balance out a family full of girls, then what's the problem with that?
__label__Evidence	there are valid medical reasons for using sex selection to combat certain diseases
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't legalize sex selection because is moral action in society
__label__Evidence	legalizing the selection of sex goes against the moral and natural principles of society
__label__Evidence	sex selection could create places where boys outnumber girls by a lot since there are many places that value boys more than girls, and this could create problems as they get older
__label__Evidence	sex selection could lead to gender inbalance in some societies.
__label__Evidence	sex selection is a slippery slope that may lead to parents picking other traits to screen for, from innocent ones like hair color, to larger ones like iq.
__label__Evidence	sex selection can possibly destroy the natural selection and over balance the society.
__label__Evidence	sex selection could lead to an imbalance of genders
__label__Evidence	every child has a right to be born regardless of their gender so sex selection should not be legalized.
__label__Evidence	sex selection could lead to genetic abnormalities and start society on a slippery slope of genetic editing at a time when it is an imperfect, untested procedure that could lead to horrific outcomes.
__label__Evidence	sex selection is unethical and morally wrong - no child should be discarded because of their gender.
__label__Evidence	"Choosing your baby's gender interferes with what nature intended. People should not ""play God""."
__label__Evidence	it should not be legal, it is costly and morally wrong
__label__Evidence	sex selection will have troublesome effects on gender disparity.
__label__Evidence	not enough girls will be selected by sexist cultures which will result in social strain in future years.
__label__Evidence	Knowing the gender of your baby makes it easier to purchase items for the baby before its birth.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing sex selection will help parents to have the exact family makeup they have always dreamed of.
__label__Evidence	sex selection allows families to be balanced.
__label__Evidence	families should have the right to choose the sex of their babies.
__label__Evidence	allowing sex selection would alleviate the depression faced by mother's who truly wanted one gender over another.
__label__Evidence	we should be able to choose the sex we wish to have.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize sex selection as it is a parents right to choose and many families may want a girl after many boys and so sex selection will help ensure a wanted pregnancy.
__label__Evidence	people should be allowed to pick the sex of their baby, only they know what's best for their child and what kind of life they'll have
__label__Evidence	sex selection goes against laws of nature and religion
__label__Evidence	sex selection should not be legalized as it is counter to biblical teachings

__label__Evidence	We should legalize sex selection because there is no harm to third parties that the government needs to intervene to prevent.
__label__Evidence	this is needed in areas where the population is unequal. when only one sex is the majority, that population would eventually cease. there wouldn't be enough mates.
__label__Evidence	sex selection should not be legalized because it is counter to nature
__label__Evidence	sex selection will invariably lead down a slippery slope of screening for other genetic factors: hair color, handedness, etc. where will it stop?

__label__Evidence	legalizing medical sex selection can prevent the abortion of unwanted gendered babies
__label__Evidence	the existence of the human being on the earth and its adaptation, and ecological domination are only the result of their natural destiny, for which the selection of sex should not be legalized
__label__Evidence	if we gave people the right to choose the sex we will have very few females in our world. they most likely would choose a boy. let god be the creator of the child and we should never intervene.
__label__Evidence	this could cause imbalance in population, if a generation is selected as mainly male or female
__label__Evidence	if that's what makes people happy then they should be allowed to do it
__label__Evidence	with the $20,000 price tag on something that is not 100% accurate, sex selection is only made available to the wealthy.
__label__Evidence	sex selection would allow the ability to balance the gender gap, allowing for an even capability to increase the population reproductively.
__label__Evidence	if people can afford it then it is their choice
__label__Evidence	we should make sex selection legal. it will lead to more freedom regarding choices of family building. a couple could choose to have a boy and a girl without just hoping for that scenario
__label__Evidence	sex selection is simply a matter of choice and bodily autonomy; every woman should be allowed to decide this on her own
__label__Evidence	it is immoral & unnatural & should not be legalized
__label__Evidence	selecting the sex of babies could lead to an in balance in society demonstrated by china , where the one child policy resulted in areas where there are approximately 10 males to 1 female.

__label__Evidence	people should be able to utilize new sciences as they please.
__label__Evidence	for those who have a genetic disorder linked to the sex of the child preventing the birth of a child with a serious illness and to prevent abuse and neglect of or treatment of a child of the unwanted gender.

__label__Evidence	sex selection is unnatural and goes against the view that it is up to god to decide the child one will have.
__label__Evidence	allow the selection of sex could alter the natural order of things
__label__Evidence	sex selection should be allowed so that families can have children of the gender they desire without overpopulating in an attempt to gain the desires sex. selection would reduce births of an unwanted sex.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't because that should be decided naturally.
__label__Evidence	people should be able to select the sex of the children so that they can balance their family the way they wish it to be.
__label__Evidence	this will lead to fewer unwanted children and improve parental satisfaction
__label__Evidence	some illnesses are inherited by one gender or another, sex selection would enable these families to have a child without this illness, it would also result in fewer abortions of children who are the wrong sex.
__label__Evidence	legalized sex selection would help couples prepare for the birth of their baby
__label__Evidence	couples should be able to select the sex of their child since some may only want boys or may want girls. they may also already have more then one child of a certain sex and want the other sex next time.
__label__Position	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
__label__Position	The EU should support Ukraine.
__label__Evidence	The EU needs its own, united Army but not to fight in a war in Ukraine against a country whose leader is unpredictable and can use nuclear weapons against us.
__label__Evidence	Do you want Europeans and Americans to get engaged in a war with Russia? More than 950 million people would have to give up everything and risk their livelihoods and lives to fight in a war that is not ours to fight and fight for a country that has a population of 44 million people.
__label__Evidence	The EU should acknowledge the fact that increasing birth rates in Europe, and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most appropriate long-term solution.
__label__Evidence	For increasing the birthrate and supporting young families, Hungary should be an example. We should not rely on migration for this.

__label__Evidence	For increasing the birthrate and supporting young families, Hungary should be an example. We should not rely on migration for this.
__label__Evidence	This is an attempt to combine the 'Multi-speed Europe' concept with the idea that European principles and values can be used as ideological clubs to beat those who engage in wrongthinking over the head with. If you insist on a set of shared EU principles and values that go beyond a mere symbolic declaration, these principles and values must include our real heritage: the Judeo-Christian values that have made Europe great. Traditional family values are first and foremost. All these values must be clearly defined in a legal sense.
__label__Position	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions
__label__Evidence	Why everything is seen in a sexual nature? Brahmacharya doesn't mean women cannot worship god. Brahmacharya means observing celibacy. It doesn't mean that there shouldn't be female devotees of reproductive age. Narrow-minded people do not understand the difference between devotion and sexual attraction.
__label__Evidence	Some other temples also ban women, and some temples ban men. If it is the same situation with Sabarimala, people wouldn't have bothered about it. But treating menstruation as impure and banning women of reproductive age is regressive and need to address. Menstruation is just a biological process. Not allowing menstruating women in temples sends a wrong message to people and future generations.
__label__Evidence	Sabarimala temple is taking funds from government and hence state government has the right to make changes in law for the temple.
__label__Position	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press
__label__Evidence	Transparency is the first key to real democracy. Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings. Or think about all the meetings between diplomats (Coreper) and civil servants (working groups and committees), where ±90% of decisions are made, for the Council to be rubberstamped. Meetings that most citizens don't even know about.
__label__Evidence	In order to strengthen democracy in the EU, Council meetings should be open to the public and the press. Only in open Council meetings are the Ministers of the Member States forced to clearly state the national interests they can vouch for in relation to their national partners and Voters. Together with the European Parliament, it focuses on an open political debate and decision-making process.
__label__Evidence	It would render the meetings useless since they would only be able to express official statements and instead negotiate new ideas without pressure.
__label__Position	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__Position	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy
__label__Evidence	It shouldn't be the European families who pay for the damage caused by multinational corporations.
__label__Evidence	Raising prices in the energy sector cannot be the solution in the fight against climate change. The European Commission allows international firms to increase their prices, and as a result, household costs are rising at an incredible rate. The EU should definitely revoke these decisions, and instead of placing the burden on its own citizens, it should instead support them to lead a more sustainable way of life. The green transition should not be a heavy burden borne on the average citizen’s shoulders
__label__Position	Holocaust denial should be a criminal offence
__label__Position	The world does not need religion anymore
__label__Evidence	As Yuval Noah Harari says “What we need now are morality and spirituality. Morality is about reducing suffering in the world. And spirituality is about questioning and looking for answers. Religions provide us just with answers and no scope of questions.”
__label__Evidence	Religion has served its purpose of uniting people, setting up structures in society, and developing trust and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are thriving towards objective realities, and religion is an inter-subjective reality and now the only thing it does is create differences in the world, brainwash people, develop animosity for other beliefs, and provide rituals that are just shortcuts to becoming a good person. (A Muslim may pray 5 times a day; a Hindu may pray daily for hours in temples; a Christian may go to church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities).
__label__Evidence	In the past, every unknown thing dealt with religious beliefs. But now Science & Technology has taken over everything. We know the reasons for drought, earthquakes, windstorms, etc. they are scientific phenomena and not the wrath of gods anymore.
__label__Evidence	Due to their technological nature, neo-banks do not need any physical bank branches, which helps them save on overhead costs (the cost of running the business). Thus, neo-banks are able to offer lower fees and higher interest rates on checking and savings accounts to customers.
__label__Evidence	People don’t trust neo-banks as much because they don’t have a physical presence, which makes them a risk for customers in case of any issues or challenges. In-person customer service may appear more trustworthy to customers.
__label__Evidence	Tech literacy is still very low in India. Traditional banks can meet the banking requirements of less tech-savvy customers or people in rural areas of the country who prefer face-to-face interaction with the manager.
__label__Evidence	Commercial banks help to create credit, which leads to increased production, employment, and consumer spending, all of which help to grow the economy.
__label__Evidence	Since neo-banks are completely digital, they operate 24 hours a day and their services can be accessed at any time. They are easy to access from anywhere through a smartphone.
__label__Evidence	Fintech companies can open specialized neo-banks that target a specific type of customer’s needs. For example, LXME aims to become India’s first Neo bank for women, which will offer product solutions that address women-specific financial needs and emotional preferences.
__label__Position	We should preserve European culture
__label__Position	Organ donation should be made compulsory
__label__Evidence	Many people are being kidnapped for organs. Illegal human organ trafficking is in almost every country. Some poor people are selling organs. All these things are consequences of organs shortage.
__label__Evidence	Not all organ transplantation surgeries are successful. The body of recipient may reject the organ of the donor.
__label__Evidence	Many people are in need of organ replacement surgeries to survive. There is a shortage of organ donors. Hence compulsory organ donation after death can ensure that no one will die due to the non-availability of healthy organs.
__label__Position	Human Gene editing is a good thing
__label__Position	We should develop Web 3.0.
__label__Position	The EU should also guarantee territorial integrity against threats from Turkey and other Middle Eastern regional powers.
__label__Evidence	I wholeheartedly agree. Securing our neighbors and allies has to be a priority. The only thing that causes me some dismay is Turkey being a part of NATO. It was a good idea in 1951 but clearly, Turkey must be out off the map now.
__label__Position	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society
__label__Evidence	Europe is full and cannot accept more illegal migrants. Those persons must be sent back and have to ask for approval from their state of origin.
__label__Evidence	Complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.
__label__Evidence	Europe is full and cannot accept more illegal migrants. Those persons must be sent back and have to ask for approval from their state of origin.
__label__Evidence	Complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.

__label__Evidence	"private military companies are only in the business for profit and not for the ""best"" for our country in it's interests and private military companies should be banned."
__label__Evidence	private military companies offer a unique way of dealing with a problem, one that keeps our actual government out of it.
__label__Evidence	pmcs should be banned, as they are profiting from war and destruction. it is their interest to cause and prolong discord in the world.
__label__Evidence	the military should be wholly the domain of governments, because they provide for national defense. a private military company is 100-percent for profit, making them less favorable to true national defense.
__label__Evidence	private military companies do not operate under the normal rules of engagement and are sometimes linked to civilian deaths
__label__Evidence	private military companies are in it for the financial gain and does not adhere to the morals of civilian casualties.

__label__Evidence	private military companies might be engaged in times of conflict when regular national military service is not eunough
__label__Evidence	private military companies are operated for profit rather than for the defence of nations.
__label__Evidence	they may sell weapons to countries that would use them inappropriately
__label__Evidence	we should ban private military companies as they are difficult to legislate and it is difficult to monitor the operations and ensure they are legal and ethical.
__label__Evidence	we should ban private military companies because they have an unfair monopoly on money and weapons.
__label__Evidence	private military companies are needed to provide security when the military can not do the job
__label__Evidence	i think that we shouldn't ban private military companies for national security
__label__Evidence	private military companies can be useful to countries who do not have their own military.
__label__Evidence	the do not abide by the same rules and regulations of a government run military and need to be banned.
__label__Evidence	private military companies only exist to continue and profit from warfare. their operations are immoral and unlawful.
__label__Evidence	Private military companies should be banned as they are not obliged to follow the strict rules of engagement that the military must which results in abuse of civilians.

__label__Evidence	private military companies offer a valuable service for instances where government military cannot do what needs to be done for fear or repercussions.
__label__Evidence	private companies have less strict guidelines and less oversight which makes them careless
__label__Evidence	private military companies are a business like any other and are subject to national and international regulations

__label__Evidence	private militaries are a threat to security if they decide to overthrow the government

__label__Evidence	private military companies are trained for combat and can assist the governmental military groups
__label__Evidence	we should not ban private military companies because they can provide great protection in many areas of our country
__label__Evidence	a lot of private resources are needed for military campaigns, such as weapon manufacture. using a private military company is no different.
__label__Evidence	only the federal government should be allowed to handle any military training.
__label__Evidence	military contractors take work away from our own troops, which the government already spends a great deal on.
__label__Evidence	private military companies only purpose is to make money and as a result they don't focus on protection as much as they should be.
__label__Evidence	private military companies are largely unregulated, and providing muscle for financial gain fosters corruption and undemocratic process - it is the survival of the powerful over the poor, oppressed.

__label__Position	The EU should strengthen development cooperation.
__label__Evidence	Europe as a whole is the world’s leading donor. The European Union should strengthen the development cooperation action, focusing on inclusive development
__label__Position	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language
__label__Position	We should subsidize higher education institutions
__label__Evidence	Indians as a whole consider educational institutions as job machines, we expect to enter unemployed and come out with employment. We don’t realize that we will have to upgrade our skills to become worthy of employment. This is the reason that more than 80% of engineers are unemployable and the figures are even worse for the non-engineers.
__label__Evidence	Though we have been establishing national-level institutes for the past 40 years, we haven’t been investing to maintain their standards. Funds are needed for quality education. Even the top Indian institutes lack proper infrastructure, labs, resources, etc. And even whatever is available is just for the sake of passing the students in the examination and sitting idle the rest of the time.
__label__Evidence	Today no problem has a single solution and no new technology is related to a single discipline. We need multiple inputs from multiple disciplines and our institutes have failed in doing so.
__label__Evidence	Indian students perform brilliantly when they go to different countries in the field of research. It means that we don’t lack talent, we lack infrastructure and a healthy environment for our sharp minds.
__label__Evidence	We haven’t been paying our teachers on the scale of what their counterparts earn in other countries. As a result, people are reluctant to the idea of teaching as a career. We have also failed to lure successful foreign faculties to our institutes.
__label__Evidence	The majority of driverless cars are going to be Electric Vehicles (EV's) which will help in decreasing the pollution level in the country, which is also one of the major issues the country is facing.
__label__Evidence	Even though driverless cars reduce vehicular accidents caused by human error, there are cases of driverless cars causing accidents.
__label__Evidence	If driverless cars are allowed in India, they can be used for a variety of other purposes also such as delivery or pickup service, which will also save time and human resources.
__label__Position	Nepotism exists in Bollywood
__label__Evidence	The standards of Indian cinemas fall at times because of nepotism. Producers and directors are pushing star kids to launch in their movies, failing to judge their acting skills and screen presence. This leads to flop movies and a loss of quality and standards of the Indian cinemas.
__label__Evidence	Star kids also have an upbringing which is surrounded by the Bollywood industry. This gives them an advantage of getting adjusted and having a clearer overview of the industry. This might help them learn faster and do better which an outsider might not be able to.
__label__Evidence	Movie stars of Bollywood often launch their children with much ease in the industry. Such acts serve as the roots of the debate for nepotism. This kind of act has been going on since ages. Hence, nepotism evidently exists in Bollywood.
__label__Position	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy
__label__Evidence	climate change can only be successfully addressed on a global scale, especially in emerging countries that will be responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions in a few decades otherwise. But to convince them to grow green we have to acknowledge that we are denying them the way to build their economy as we did in the past 200 years. So we must support emerging countries in their transition to a green economy.
__label__Position	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Position	NGO boats should have an government representative on board to make sure they aren't people trafficking
__label__Evidence	NGO boats should be forbidden, only Frontex should intervene to bring them home
__label__Position	India should transition to electric vehicles
__label__Evidence	Maybe while helping economic integration in Africa to happen, we will discover that we could go further in our own EU development. We could foster transnational companies which operate on both continents but not primarily the very big ones. I think of companies that supply solar power solutions to rural areas or microcredit banks. Create platforms where best choice and best practice solutions can evolve. This way, we can establish a single common market.
__label__Evidence	With highly subsidized agricultural products the EU destroys local markets in African countries. This procedure should be stopped as soon as possible. EU agricultural subsidies should be replaced with incentives and support for a sustainable transition. The earlier we abandon these unfair and highly unsustainable subsidies the better for our own future health, social development, and climate future. Also, this will lead to a better relationship with African Union and enable better livelihoods for African farmers and citizens,
__label__Evidence	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas. If these young people create for example remote learning opportunities for African students, we should not only sponsor such projects but make exchange possible for young people in Europe to create similar items for example to foster MINT skills throughout Europe. Give more opportunities for young people from both sides to meet, exchange, and ventilate new ideas.
__label__Evidence	Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.
__label__Evidence	Discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.
__label__Evidence	Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.
__label__Evidence	Discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.
__label__Position	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries
__label__Evidence	taxation seems to be the only real way to incentivize other countries less worried about climate change to work on it
__label__Position	We should end illegal pushbacks!
__label__Position	We should promote mental health
__label__Position	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration
__label__Position	We should tax heavily or refuse to import products not manufactured in the European Union that do not comply with our climate standards
__label__Position	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__Evidence	Expansion by many dissimilar members and in particular the implementation of the EURO has made the EU unmanageable. The EURO is too strong for the less competitive members and is therefore unsustainable.
__label__Evidence	Without change, the EU will be following the route of the USSR and other communist countries, who after 70 years of trying to build a social paradise ended in poverty and suppression.
__label__Position	We need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy.
__label__Evidence	The intention of helping a country with democratization can easily be used to justify violent actions.
__label__Position	The EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it
__label__Evidence	'We most definitely do not need a wider definition of 'gender-based' anything. 'Gender' is a politicized left-wing concept. I certainly encourage wider protection from violence against women and girls. That should most definitely include protection from the violence and coercion young women face from 'trans' activists. We also want nothing to do with 'intersectionality' which is a neo-Marxist concept of overlapping oppressions. No one is being oppressed in Europe.

__label__Evidence	it's cruel for the animals to be caged
__label__Evidence	zoos are inherently cruel to the animals, keeping them confined in unnatural conditions for the benefit of entertaining human visitors - they are miserable, and more prone to disease.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish zoos as they contribute to the breeding of endangered species and the reintroduction of animals to the wild

__label__Evidence	zoos provide the only places for some endangered species to survive that they are essential and we should not abolish them we need to support them and their breeding programs.

__label__Evidence	zoos can aid conservation by raising awareness of animals that are facing extinction and raising funds to support them in the wild.
__label__Evidence	confining animals in small spaces is cruel.
__label__Evidence	zoos can help people, especially those with little money, to discover the beauty of wildlife and learn how to protect endangered species

__label__Evidence	zoos are an educational and entertaining tool and the animals are well fed and cared for.
__label__Evidence	we shouldnt because they are helping animals that might be going extinct to help breed.
__label__Evidence	zoos keep wild animals locked up in areas smaller than they are used to in the wild and it is not natural for them.
__label__Evidence	zoos are an excellent way to provide entertainment and togetherness for families. they provide activities that no other venue can provide. they should not be abolished.
__label__Evidence	zoos constrict wild animals to enclosures not suitable for them purely for enjoyment

__label__Evidence	zoos often exhibit poor standards of animal welfare, since they are designed to make money for their owners - it is essentially exploitation under the guise of environmental 'protection'.
__label__Evidence	zoos are the only way we can preserve endangered species.
__label__Evidence	animals need to be free and unrestricted, zoos offer small enclosures, denying animals the chance to survive and thrive in their own habitat.
__label__Evidence	zoos are helping in many ways the animals that are going extinct and that will not make it in the wild so they should not be abolished.
__label__Evidence	zoos are good source of information for the public to learn about animals up close
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish zoos because they are helping out endangered species that would otherwise be extinct if they went back into the wild now.
__label__Evidence	Zoos are unnatural places for wild animals to live and causes many of them to live long, sad lives in cages.
__label__Evidence	zoos are bad for wild animals that need to live free
__label__Evidence	zoos are the only places many people will be able to get close and observe exotic animals - anything that serves to enhance humans' empathy and understanding of animals is worthy of support.
__label__Evidence	zoos should be abolished because it is cruel and inhumane to cage animals.
__label__Evidence	Animals should not be kept in cages. They should be able to run free.
__label__Evidence	Zoos work as educational centers and are not the cause of the extinction of animals, rather they help that this does not happen, that's why we should not abolish zoos
__label__Evidence	Zoos offer an easy and cheap way for people to see and learn about animals from all over the world.
__label__Evidence	Zoos are too often a place of mistreatment and death for wild animals. We should abolish them and move onto other conservation efforts.
__label__Evidence	zoos serve to imprison animals and show them off for entertainment.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish zoos because it's cruel to keep wild animals in small enclosures and spaces just for our amusement.
__label__Evidence	animals in zoos are miserable and confined.
__label__Evidence	zoos hold animals in cages when they should be free
__label__Evidence	animals kept in captivity are quite often better looked after than animals in the wild they have better medical and dental treatment than a lot of humans and can live longer than in the wild
__label__Evidence	some animals would be extinct if it weren't for zoos
__label__Evidence	Zoos are places that protect and breed animals that would otherwise become extinct.
__label__Evidence	High voter turnout is usually desirable, but it's a symptom, not the root cause. Forcing people to go to the polls doesn't mean they will make more informed choices. Besides, voter turnout is a good metric that tells us where the potential problems of voter disenfranchisement are which is the first step to addressing them.
__label__Position	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__Position	The use of public defenders should be mandatory
__label__Position	We should prohibit women in combat
__label__Position	Germany should start paying reparations share for any damaged countries of Europe up to 100 years after its attack on international society
__label__Evidence	Will Russia also pay their share? Will Austria pay for starting WW1 or will it be Serbia? Will Poland and Hungary pay for occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia in 1938/1939? Will France pay for starting napoleonic wars? It is time to forget what happened almost 100 years ago and focus on the future and I say that as a Czech citizen whose country was occupied by Austria, Germany/Poland/Hungary and then by SSSR and all eastern satelite states.
__label__Position	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__Position	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech
__label__Evidence	I have advice on how you can defend against anything on the Internet. Turn it OFF. And one more piece of advice, try to study something about freedom and responsibility, they are not just mere words. Plato, Socrates, Hayek, Borovský, Auberon Herbert, Herbert Spencer, Roger Scruton, Ronald Reagan (speeches), Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson ... There are texts thousands of years old and also recent books ... you can start anywhere you wish ...
__label__Evidence	Yes, the European Union needs effective policies to combat online hate speech and these need to be regularly updated as technology evolves and to take into account worldwide learning on how to effectively combat online hate speech.
__label__Evidence	The internet has provided unprecedented opportunities to express and comment on almost anything. But this also brings with it responsibility. Where is the boundary between freedom of expression and speech hate speech, which is no longer tolerated by the law? How can we oppose such acts – such as insults, vulgarism, or threats on social networks? Or can everyone say anything on the internet?
__label__Evidence	People's feelings arent all that important. If you have had enough of the Internet, you can always find yourself a hobby.
__label__Position	We should fight racism in the EU
__label__Position	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country.
__label__Evidence	Helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country they are living in are critical to successful integration. Language and norms of the job market and workplace should also be built in.

__label__Position	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Position	There should be a common EU migration and asylum policy
__label__Evidence	A common policy is a completely wrong solution. It will only lead to the fact that the system will be fully implemented on the terms of Sweden and Germany, who support open borders, and will bring down the entire EU and the traditional welfare states.
__label__Position	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration.
__label__Evidence	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should lose its government/EU funding.
__label__Evidence	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should be required to provide financial support in dignified conditions.
__label__Evidence	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should also be dragged in front of the court for not taking the illegals to the closest safe port. In 90% of the cases, the closest port lies in Africa.

__label__Position	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world
__label__Evidence	The European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides. And as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are doing constantly dividing work between member states. As all successes start in your head, perhaps some attention should be allocated to the media. The EU has a clear chance to become one of the major poles of this multipolar world order.
__label__Position	We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning as it will only cause huge issues when you have a bunch of the same humans running around all acting the same.

__label__Evidence	human cloning allows for the study of genetic disorders, opening the door for huge leaps in medical science and disease cures.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban human cloning because it can help save lifes
__label__Evidence	human cloning should be banned because the ethical problems it creates are too difficult to overcome
__label__Evidence	human cloning should be banned as the long term effects on the cloned is still uncertain and could lead to long term health complications
__label__Evidence	human cloning will end up with individuals who only exist as a means to an end, which is deeply unethical.
__label__Evidence	human cloning is not good for humanity, less for evolution
__label__Evidence	human cloning should not be banned because it may lead to the ability to generate human organs for transplant which would save many lives
__label__Evidence	human cloning is vital for medical science as it might be able to identify treatments and cures for diseases
__label__Evidence	human cloning could aid medical advances and should therefore be allowed.
__label__Evidence	human cloning could help humanity by creating being with similar organ types that could be donated to the sick
__label__Evidence	human cloning could be dangerous in the wrong hands, for example dictators who could use it for unethical reasons.
__label__Evidence	human cloning should not be banned as it the next step in medicine and will allow for transplantation to be simpler and easier to perform
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because it is not fair to the clone who is a living being but has no parents or friends and is essentially a lab experiment
__label__Evidence	we can not allow the cloning of humans, it goes against the laws of god and the laws of nature
__label__Evidence	human cloning could lead to people replacing themselves with images themselves. this could lead to the end of human evolution which could make us more vulnerable to disease.
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because cloning takes away from the unique individuality of a person.
__label__Evidence	human cloning is unethical. what would happen to the clones once they were created? harvest their organs and then what? euthanize them like garbage?
__label__Evidence	human cloning may solve all types of medical problems.
__label__Evidence	this is an unnatural process that should be against the law.
__label__Evidence	human cloning can ensure that certain strengths of a human trait is continued therefore human cloning should be allowed to be accomplished.
__label__Evidence	human cloning is far from being perfected and can lead to major unethical behavior by geneticists that can result in grave mistakes and horrific experiments.
__label__Evidence	cloning would have strict regulations on how to handle clones and ethical dilemmas. scientific advancements made while working towards cloning can advance the human race.
__label__Evidence	cloning is controversial and it is against religious ethics
__label__Evidence	human cloning can aid in research for medical issues as well as preserving the continuation of humankind.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban human cloning because this will lessen our chances for finding cures to the some of the most deadly diseases such as cancer and dementia
__label__Evidence	there has to be a limit on what science can ethically do and human cloning is a step too far and should be banned for fear of this science being missued.
__label__Evidence	Cloning could lead to designer humans and we will lose the diversity of the human race
__label__Evidence	human cloning can give us medical breakthroughs
__label__Evidence	human cloning should be banned as it is equivalent to playing god.
__label__Evidence	human cloning shows us pushing the boundaries of science to their fullest potential. think of all we can learn if we perfect cloning. it shows how far man has come and can continue to go.
__label__Evidence	it would help in research for breakthroughs in health
__label__Evidence	human cloning could lead to scientific breakthroughs that could solve many of the world's problems.
__label__Evidence	contamination can happen very easy, cloning a human with contaminated cells could lead to diseases with no cure being spread worldwide
__label__Evidence	Human cloning goes against nature and should be banned.
__label__Evidence	we should allow scientists to continue to try to clone humans. just as medical treatments have progressed in the world who can predict what types of improvements in ending disease could occur.
__label__Evidence	human cloning opens up a whole new level of ethics, such as the rights of the clone, that we are unprepared to handle legally and morally.
__label__Evidence	This could provide organs for transplant patients in dire need as well as many other medical advancements.
__label__Evidence	human cloning in the wrong hands could be very dangerous to society
__label__Evidence	we should allow science to further their research even if it includes human cloning.
__label__Evidence	Human cloning could provide a great benefit to mankind by eradicating illnesses and disease through replication of people known to be fit, well and healthy.
__label__Evidence	by copying something you can not get a pure copy. each copy that is made is worse then the other meaning that no one knows what can happen with cloning.
__label__Evidence	if we begin to play god with our scientific advances that could very well lead to our demise.
__label__Evidence	without knowing the long term effects of cloning, it shouldn't be attempted on humans because it could be medically problematic.
__label__Evidence	can lead to many medical breakthroughs that may help cure and or treat many different disease
__label__Evidence	without further testing and experimentation, the outcome of human cloning will never be known so should not be banned.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban human cloning because the potential scientists can find a cure for a disease
__label__Evidence	human cloning helps to eradicate diseases and should not be banned
__label__Evidence	human cloning should be banned because it interferes with nature
__label__Evidence	human cloning is unnatural and against the laws of nature
__label__Evidence	we need to spend money on people who are already alive and need help before we create new ones
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because people were not made to be cloned, we are all unique and individual for a reason.
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because it is against the natural law and it is morally wrong
__label__Evidence	cloning human beings goes against nature with which we could have serious consequences in the future
__label__Evidence	human cloning will lead to scientific advancements that will save lives and as such, should not be banned
__label__Evidence	human cloning is against many religions and can have disasterous results if we make a simple mistake. that clone would then have to live with that mistake forever.
__label__Evidence	Human cloning is a bad science. this science will endanger the world since the cloned humans will have no parents, no rights and will behave in free-will.
__label__Evidence	human cloning could give us a better understanding of the human body thus leading to medical breakthroughs.
__label__Evidence	human cloning not only can aid in securing the longevity of a familial line but aid in research to target diseases that can find a cure.
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning, the ethical issues this practice would raise are impossible to manage
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning as humans should not play god and it raises a moral issue.
__label__Evidence	it's not right to be able to clone people because people might use clones for crime
__label__Evidence	human cloning could allow parents an opportunity to replace a dead child and baby with a new child that is the same. this would help them deal with their original loss.
__label__Evidence	cloning could prevent defective genes from being passed
__label__Evidence	human cloning is just a step in the natural progression of science
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because we could all end up with designer babies and everyone will be the same.
__label__Evidence	human cloning can provide a lot of advancements to medical science. to ban it out of some knee-jerk fear is to deny ourselves all of these potential great advancements
__label__Evidence	Human cloning should not be banned as at may prevent the study and advance of medical science.
__label__Evidence	human cloning lets people play god.
__label__Evidence	Abortion kills a human being. It can be justified only in very rare cases.
__label__Evidence	Every human being has a conscience that allows them to recognize what is true and what is good, and it is by virtue of this awareness that we demand that no European Union funds be allocated to activities that destroy human embryos.
__label__Evidence	Every human has the right to live. The developing child in the womb, the children, the adults, and those who are of old age and need nursing.
__label__Position	We should stop mass migration.
__label__Evidence	What we are now seeing are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over years the population will have grown to 2,0 billion. That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today. At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear. Not much of a future for the young Europeans.
__label__Evidence	We do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices. Innovation is failing and the best we can do is defend the status quo and the old people in power.
__label__Evidence	But also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...
__label__Evidence	Nonsense. Mass migration is a crime against humanity. Endorse this idea: No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Evidence	The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter. The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality.

__label__Position	The demographic decline should be stopped.
__label__Evidence	The EU is in demographic decline. At the start of the 19th century, Europe accounted for 15% of the world's population. By 2050, it will be 5%.
__label__Position	We should change corporate accounting rules to include climate change and biodiversity loss
__label__Position	The EU must use its weight as a united global player in trade policy and put an end to foreclosure
__label__Evidence	For Europe to act outwardly as a unit, we must first look inward. At the psychological level, how can we create a European home market? What does it take, for example, for a resident of Spain to think of Czech printers as a local product? Will it be possible to reach an agreement on Europe's historical events and interpret them to everyone's satisfaction? This process will take some time.
__label__Position	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__Position	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making
__label__Position	We should stop buying Russian gas
__label__Position	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.
__label__Position	We should invest in integrated photovoltaic (e.g., over agriculturally used land)
__label__Position	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Position	We should make living wages a human right
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree many people are able to not get aggressive over a newspaper topic, however there are plenty that do, and allowing full expression of opinions without monitoring and consequences could lead to people being offended or bullied
__label__Evidence	Rules will need to be put in place to make this work. But I agree it's worthwhile.
__label__Position	Establish a tricameral legislature with chambers for different age groups
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately, we are way to late for this. The internet has been used for more than 20 years and it's getting worse. Hate speech does a lot of damages and we need to act quickly because it causes a lot of harm for several groups of people, ethnic groups, etc.
__label__Evidence	If there is not a comment section, writers will not know how the reader feels about the article.
__label__Position	There are a couple of ways to do that: * Increasing the number of moderator. They can constrantly moderate the comments and enforce perma-ban.
__label__Position	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Evidence	I think it would take more than one person in many cases and have heard that professional moderators have to have appropriate support and training due to the nature of items that can be posted to such sites.
__label__Evidence	Other issues directly affect me, other countries pollute far more than ours does 
__label__Position	Censor specific words often attributed to hate speech so they can not be used in comment sections.
__label__Evidence	Followers are just as important as leaders.
__label__Evidence	But immigration affects health and the economy
__label__Evidence	I appreciate the balance here.
__label__Evidence	Yes this is a sensible solution to this problem
__label__Position	Reading the comments below, I do agree that people should be allowed to write their opinions online but I also agree that there is should be any kind of regulation that avoids hate speech. It has been discussed and shown over the years the impact of what is said on the internet in mental health. So I think it is time to be more restrict with alghoritms and detect certain keywords that are a red flag.
__label__Position	All readers have the right to freedom of speech, which is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, incitement of violence is not protected by The First Amendment. Since there are no laws regarding hate speech in the constitution - you cannot fairly censor or hide comments unless they are inciting violence.
__label__Position	We really need a change. This cost of living crisis needs sorting as soon as possible
__label__Evidence	True, the staffs need more training and patients shouldnt be discharged if not fully recovered 
__label__Position	"""The impact of climate change and cultural heritage is an issue of human rights. Can we mitigate and adapt to climate change? Carrig Conservation International (established in 1995) is the oldest and largest building conservation consultancy currently operating in Ireland. We have carried out many projects (also research projects) for Historic England. We have recently completed major conversation and retro-fit projects as well "" (Peter A. Cox) https://www.carrig.ie/"
__label__Evidence	Europe has more economic leverage over Israel than the US
__label__Position	Climate change science is inconclusive.
__label__Evidence	but how fast is it progressing and can we slow it enough to even make a difference?
__label__Evidence	Aggression is a subjective aspect. Someone may be expressing themselves passionately, but is seen as aggressive. Cultural differences and misinterpretation of words and intent can also influence opinion of a comment's 'aggression'.
__label__Position	moderating the comments
__label__Position	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__Position	I believe that we can educate people against posting hateful speech. without specific reference i believe education is the best way to combart this problem.
__label__Position	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__Evidence	I agree 100%. And to add people should be asked to explain their comments. Most hateful comments are just people trolling and looking to cause a stir.
__label__Position	Comments on newspaper websites are beneficial as different opinions are valued, however these opinions should never be hateful. Comment sections should be somewhere people feel comfortable enough to have a conversation, without fearing being subject to hateful comments. To combat this, newspaper websites could inform people on what hate speech is and remove comments that are hateful. This is to create a good environment without people feeling they should be hateful. Hateful comments are neither necessary nor appreciated.
__label__Evidence	Would ensure representation of different age groups and perspectives
__label__Evidence	I agree, everybody has freedom of speech and we all have to right to access t information.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this
__label__Evidence	Allowing hate speech, only perpetuates prejudice and discrimination.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech doesn't and should never encourage hate speech. The sad part about finding ways to reduce hate speech in comments section is the fact that it will lead to cencorship which is goes against reporting.
__label__Position	If a Newspaper wants to allow comments on their site and then they have to expect that hate speech and other negative comments will eventually appear, with this in mind I think moderation (and first line computer based monitoring which can pickup up common words phrases and other easy stuff automatically) has got to be the least they can do, along with making their terms and conditions and other warnings easily visible during registration and prior to posting. Any comments section (of any website, not just newspapers) is a target for negative extreme comments and unfortunately it is part of the Internet in its current form which easily allows anonymity to all who use it.
__label__Position	I think that is very difficult to control.  Maybe you would need a team of moderators constantly monitoring alongside bots to catch hate speech.  Hate speech is unacceptable and should be addressed, however difficult to manage.
__label__Evidence	The disparity between London and outside of it it's crazy 
__label__Position	Vote for change and then reality will kick in again
__label__Position	AI that seeks to mute or censor certain words instead of removing comment section where individuals across the world interact about the topic at hand
__label__Evidence	I disagree with this. I think taking away discussion completely also takes away healthy debate and positive conversation. There are ways to reduce hate comments, such as the ones outlined in this Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/04/09/10-tips-to-dealing-with-trolls/?sh=58ddf0f754f4.
__label__Position	To keep the refrigerant management and forest restoration helps to change the climate.It could take a very long period of time but coming decades are survive easily. 
__label__Position	The NHS, The war in Gaza and the UKs response, affordable housing, safer routes for migrants
__label__Evidence	censoring/controlling speech in any way is a power that can be used to push a narrative, even with the best intentions in mind. The only way to have free and open debate is to not censor comments or ideas
__label__Position	Use digital solutions to engage and inform citizens about EU decision-making
__label__Position	tax, childcare, educatio and the NHS
__label__Evidence	I think hate speech should be reduced as much as possible if not removed completely. This is very different from being able to provide constructive criticism which should always be allowed but there are boundaries.
__label__Position	I feel that important topics like climate change and immigration won't be handled well by Labour
__label__Evidence	The incoming government should make relevant and long term rules regarding immigration 
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Position	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__Position	only constructive criticism should be allowed
__label__Position	Climate change science is inconclusive. 
__label__Evidence	Abuse and hate speech shouldn't be tolerated
__label__Evidence	I strongly agree with your opinion, however the reader comments need to be respect as a platform despite people having the right to freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	"Majority judgment allows for a more nuanced and inclusive decision-making process compared to binary referendums. BASED ON: """"And everybody tells what he thinks about each alternatives. And at the end you have an aggregated method to rank all the alternatives and to decide which one is the best."", Person27 and ""In Country4 there are different several people that defend the idea of, uh, they call the referendum initiative popular. So it’s a popular referendum initiative, uh, on these kind of things. But the problem is that with referendum, since it’s binary, uh, the clear, the output is often, uh, deceptive."", Person27 "
__label__Evidence	It's still too cold.
__label__Evidence	Not with Keir Starmer 
__label__Position	NHS, Cost of living, 
__label__Evidence	Involving farmers in a research, ensures that all   findings are relevant and adaptable to their specific conditions.
__label__Position	For me its the cost of living crisis, State of the NHS
__label__Position	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech allows others to express their opinions so we can have an open debate in the hopes of coming to some common agreement about polarising topics. https://youtu.be/WtftZPL-k7Y
__label__Position	The climate and nature crisis
__label__Position	I am skeptical of man-made climate change. To answer the prompt I would say yes, it is possible to balance it out. I am not sure what reversing it means. Our planet adapts to climate changes over time. It always has. During the time of the dinosaurs the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere was greater than it is today. Earth's climate will always change. Mother nature has the ability to adapt. 
__label__Evidence	Yes. More high rises.
__label__Evidence	I agree. And the majority of time people are not hateful or threatening. Those should be obvious enough to be simply removed/banned and everything else is fair game even if you dont like hearing it or dont agree its right/true etc
__label__Position	Exactly - there are plenty of other online spaces where people can comment on articles - no need for them to also be able to comment directly under the articles themselves.
__label__Evidence	I agree we need a change.  But we have nothing credible to change to. 
__label__Position	Directly elect the President of the European Commission
__label__Position	Hate comments are always not good for any person
__label__Evidence	People should be allowed to express their opinions as long as they are done so respectfully
__label__Position	"""In my experience, social housing can be particularly difficult because one needs to design for the worst case in terms of occcupancy levels and behaviour. But this can make both the retrofit and often its maintenance unaffordably expensive. Is Clarion (and Wales) finding ways around this?"" (Bill Bordass)"
__label__Evidence	Theres definitely been a massive shift on climate change in construction - however for example emission reduction from cars is rather difficult unless the country changes how it works (help with purchase of an electric cars, helps for low earners - i am a minim wage worker myself and personally could not afford to upgrade to an electric vehicle with cost of living - ie high insurance, petrol etc) 
__label__Position	The problems left by Brexit
__label__Evidence	There must be an area for people to voice their opinions, even if some people use it to display aggression.
__label__Position	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__Position	Maybe if the person commenting can only do so through a social profile like Facebook, it would police their response more so than being anonymous? Although someone can just make a fake account and I have seen people ruin their social reputation by saying questionable things online very publicly and not caring so moderators may be the best option.
__label__Position	It is important for people to voice their opions so I do not thik this discussion is fair, however I do agree that comments should be moderated. The readers should also be made aware of the rules that apply to commenting with regards to hateful speech.
__label__Evidence	none of them to seem to be honest, it seems to be a trait missing in all our politicians 
__label__Position	I agree it is going to need a world effort to control the climate change and also we need to use classic technologies like cycle and public transports . If we don't do it we are suffers lot. surly human cause the global warming the large countries and humans need aware of it. bio gas and low carbon released vehicles most electric and solar vehicles are best.  
__label__Evidence	I tend to agree with this. In this way editors have a close look to what opinion can be published and which one entails hate speech.
__label__Position	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__Evidence	So because of some people acting like idiots, no one can express their opinion??
__label__Position	ever rising inflation
__label__Position	LABOUR ARE GOING TO WIN. THATS A GIVEN, SCARY AS HELL BUT A GIVEN. WE CAN BUT HOPE REFORM GET A BIG ENOUGH FOOTHOLD TO START CREATING CHANGE.
__label__Position	I think the comments sections are important for discussion and sharing of opinions, whilst acknowledging the damage that can be caused by hate speech. Moderators, moderation by other commentators and harsher penalties for offenders could be a way of allowing free speech to be maintained without giving voice to those who wish to share hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I think this is a good idea, but people have a way of getting around these filters by using different fonts or characters that cannot be read by the filter bots.
__label__Evidence	It could be done manually at first but then an AI machine could learn from the manual responses to determine what is considered hate speech
__label__Position	the rights and safety of girls and women
__label__Evidence	Elimination is not a solution, education and deliberation is
__label__Evidence	Implementing these can have a favourable outcome.
__label__Evidence	reasonable discussion and points
__label__Position	The cost of Net-Zero and whether it is necessary to spend vast amounts for little benefit
__label__Evidence	This will allow online users to think twice before spewing hate speech
__label__Position	We could add a moderating element to the newspaper site in order to prevent hurtful comments
__label__Evidence	I should tell you why i agree, right?
__label__Evidence	who decides which words are to be blocked and which are not, some people may find certain words offence while others may not.
__label__Evidence	i agree there has to be a balance, and freedom of speech is important for society.. but there has to be limits as to hate speech, and discrimination.
__label__Evidence	"But should we then allow ""freedom of speech"" to propagate into free hate speech for anyone to use on the platform. Only through learning and understanding that there are rules and responsibilities can one start removing forms of hate speech. There should be regulations put in place for offenders."
__label__Position	Early proactive communication is key to preventing polarization
__label__Position	crime, nhs, poverty, taxes, minimum wage, economy
__label__Evidence	immigration is nice but dont u think that will decrease budget for the rest of the country while increasing population and NHS care 
__label__Position	Again I think that removing comment sections entirely would overall be a negative thing. Yes, there are people who abuse the comments section and it they can use it to promote hate speech, but with the right tools this could be moderated. Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning
__label__Evidence	"""Example: 63 years to payback carbon for demolishing a building"" (Peter Cox)"
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech should be taken as a form of free speech. If it degrades or inflicts harm on another individual if should not be regarded as hate speech
__label__Position	The education system needs to be reformed to address challenges posed by social media and AI
__label__Position	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this. The trick is how to select unbiased moderators. They have to go by a guideline
__label__Evidence	hate speech doesnt allways include certain hateful word so wont work in all cases
__label__Evidence	Removing the comment section will not prevent hate speech from occurring. People will find an alternative online platform, e.g. forums. Instead, companies should focus on moderating the comment section/providing links as to why posts that may be flagged are harmful. We need to focus more on prevention as opposed to reaction.
__label__Evidence	Some newspapers already don't have comment sections on certain articles which they think would attract harmful comments or trolls.
__label__Evidence	Very much agree, leadership however is looking very poor no matter what we choose. Defence is something needs money spent right away, specifically if the Orange buffoon gets back in
__label__Evidence	Rail especially, a major overhaul needed 
__label__Evidence	removing comments section is never going to encourage tolerance it is
__label__Position	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__Evidence	It is good to see alternative points of view presented on the page via reader comments. I think this can help to reduce the echo chamber phenomenon, particularly when readers cannot 'like' a comment.
__label__Evidence	there is a difference in exchange of ideas and then being hateful.
__label__Position	i will be voting tactically as my sole motivation is to get the tories out
__label__Position	Countering extremism
__label__Evidence	agree
__label__Evidence	"I agree with this. I would extend it to the ""new religions"" too (such as gender ideology)."
__label__Position	set rules that deal with hate speech.
__label__Evidence	This is very true, but then isn't it time to start before it gets to be a worse situation? The economic impacts are starting to hit now.  
__label__Position	The economy, cost of living crisis, illegal immigration, knife crime 
__label__Evidence	May not address fundamental systemic issues
__label__Evidence	Politicians need to be made accountable, to they promises they make in their manifesto and debates. 
__label__Position	I disagree with eliminating the comment section. Some online newspapers manage to limit hate speech by using algorithms, which allow a free flow of ideas. It's not perfect, but the alternative of no comment section creates an echo chamber that is neither desirable, nor useful to the reader.
__label__Evidence	I absolutely agree, everyone should be able to express how they feel however shouldn't do so at the expense of others.
__label__Position	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__Position	Wether the party to vote for has good intentions in regards to tax and foreigners
__label__Position	"I think it would be helpful if we could create a trusted shared resource for quickly checking accuracy of information. Something like Snopes https://www.snopes.com/ for example that helps you quickly sort out whether the information is balanced. It doesn't fix the issue because there's always contention about ""reliable sources"" but it can help reduce some of that, perhaps news agencies can link them in the top of the comments section or include it as a quick link button when commenting so you can easily fact that comment itself without copy pasting."
__label__Position	They should automatically detect hate speech whenever detected and the delete it, that would be much better.
__label__Position	Hate speech is offensive and oftentimes discriminating. Adding the unique profile capacity, keyword identification, a way to report a comment and even moderators can have a good effect. Regarding what to consider hate speech, I would start with criminalized actions, such as racism, homophobia and anti-semitism.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech must be maintained but there is a level at which verbal abuse should be banned. Maybe some exclusions to personal abuse phrasese and comments should be employed
__label__Evidence	Agree, moderation is the way to go, as hate speech should not be part of any media forums.
__label__Position	I think most of us agree that measures should be put in place to reduce hate speach, and hate in general. So if a newspaper enables a comment section, then yes, they should ensure that hate speech is not admitted there, but how far should that go? And who decides? I think lies should also not be allowed in the comments section as they can be equally dangerous and can question the integrity of the newspaper, even though they had nothing to do with the lie in the comment section. All this would be practically impossible to control though unless you hire staff to do so, but I feel its a waste of already low funds that should go to good reporting and investigating. Removing the comment section would be best. Its not a forum for comments but to report facts and events. If you want to comments, go to blogs etc, or  even, dicuss it with others, in person!
__label__Position	"Newspapers should be neutral when reporting, however, nowadays that isnt the case and I feel they are the ones that actually instigate hate speech - negativity sells and if they can get as much reaction they will go to any lenghts to do so. In order to fairly reduce the hate speech from readers comments it has to be heavily moderated, personal details required in order to make a comment and possibly have a word block or something where the comment is replaced with ""this goes against our hate speech policy"""
__label__Position	In todays world where Artificial intelligence is a thing, it would be very easy to remove hate speech in the comment section without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	We could introduce a system online where it automatically filters out bad language or hate speech by using key words.
__label__Position	screen it before it gets posted, hire more people, they need more jobs available anyway
__label__Position	Another interesting article - focusing on some original research about comment on Huffington Post articles.  The researchers tested three different scenarios - (1) where commenters could easily set up multiple accounts; (2) where commenters had to authenticate their account (via Facebook) but didn't have to use their own names; (3) where commenting was outsourced to Facebook, so any comment made could be seen by the commenters friends and family.  Surprisingly, it was the second scenario which had the best outcome - i.e. the comments were less weary and had more 'cognitive complexity'.  It suggests you don't actually have to reveal your own personal details to everyone online, to create the safest kind of commenting environment; but that people should be required to create a stable identity.    https://theconversation.com/online-anonymity-study-found-stable-pseudonyms-created-a-more-civil-environment-than-real-user-names-171374
__label__Evidence	Communication alone is not enough without systemic change
__label__Evidence	With globalization terms that are derogatory in one country may mean something different in another country most recent example being Lizzo.
__label__Evidence	I would imagine that it would be difficult to filter out all of the hate speech
__label__Evidence	They have run this country into the ground in my opinion, cut police and NHS funding, crime rates have gone up, illegal immigration at an all time high, cost of living crisis. Why do you think they would be better for us than labour this time round? 
__label__Evidence	Agreed, and it would still allow opinions to be shared
__label__Position	Those commenting with negative comment should be blocked so that they cant be able to access the website again
__label__Evidence	I find it very helpful when the comments includes updates or links to a more current news story
__label__Position	The big one for me is getting a Government that is honest, competent and has the welfare of everyone at his heart. This last 14 years (and particularly the last 5) has seen MPs appear to be in it for themselves and/or their party rather than the country as a whole.
__label__Position	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__Position	i think the platform should screen comments then if they are hateful it should flag and warn the writer to change the language / make them aware in a way that is inline with hate acts but at the same time without distorting free speech
__label__Evidence	I agree with this - but it makes me just as angry that all this is being done without asking us. The attitude just seems to be 'shut up plebs' and let us make the decisions
__label__Evidence	have to be careful with banned lists, sometimes they dont do what theyre meant to
__label__Evidence	No fact checking
__label__Evidence	Rent caps will deter private landlords entering the market ultimately making the situation worse as there will be less rental properties on the market 
__label__Evidence	People bypass these filters in a large number of ways that are hard to stay ahead of. A simple method for example is replacing an E with a 3 in a word so egg becomes 3gg. It is still pretty clear what is being said and bybasses the system that says I can not use that word for example.
__label__Evidence	Internet education about etiquette and how to behave kindly to other people should be enforced.
__label__Position	Achieving sustainable agriculture faces significant challenges, including environmental issues like climate change, soil degradation, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss; economic hurdles such as the high cost of transition and market access; social obstacles including the need for education, supportive policies, and secure land tenure; and technological barriers related to the development and adoption of new practices. Balancing environmental health, economic viability, and social equity requires integrated approaches and systemic changes in food systems, demanding collaborative efforts from governments, the private sector, researchers, and civil society.
__label__Evidence	Cost of living is a key concern for me, too. Both directly, and because it impacts on other areas such as negative perceptions of immigration
__label__Evidence	I agree to this
__label__Evidence	A Robin Hood tax on high-end financial transactions that do nothing to stimulate the economy 
__label__Position	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__Position	By using moderators or AI to police the posts
__label__Evidence	that requires people who play by the rules
__label__Position	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__Position	Fed up with immigration, it takes away from the big issues like health and economy
__label__Position	Freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequence, just because you say something it should not be without consequence if it is harmful. Hate speech is harmful and should be restricted and most of the time it is not constructive or helpful.
__label__Evidence	I agree, but I don't know what the mechanism would be for linking comments to the actual people who made them.
__label__Position	Local businesses need a boost
__label__Evidence	Understand immigration is required to support the workforce and the skills that we just don't have enough homegrown talent but it's the illegal immigration that I feel is a problem 
__label__Evidence	will not work at all the dynamics of the comments section are very polarised
__label__Position	I'm really angry that the personal tax allowance has been frozen for so long (for everyone). Not sure any party has committed on that
__label__Position	The comments sections need to be more heavily moderated. The comments section shouldn't be closed as we have a right to express our opinions but some commenters should be banned if they express purely hateful comments. Comment sections on the daily mail have been described as hateful cesspits, which can be true with people spouting hateful bullying comments. Therefore more moderation is needed to ensure people can still express themselves, but purely vile comments aren't allowed.

__label__Evidence	Moderator biases
__label__Evidence	Is there any evidence to suggest people prefer the comments?
__label__Position	"In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check ""users"" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help"
__label__Position	Environment, economy and human rights
__label__Evidence	They could offer safe routes to process immigrants, but they prefer to demonise immigrants.  
__label__Position	i think that in order to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites only people who have purchased a supscription should be allowed to comment that way if they make hateful comments they can be tracked back to the individual
__label__Position	Funding for the NHS, education and pensions. Also the issue of climate change.
__label__Evidence	Education alone is not enough, people need to want to engage
__label__Evidence	I agree! 
__label__Position	The newspaper should vet newspaper reader and make sure their platform is not dominated by racist
__label__Position	We need more engagement with farmers and producers in policy decisions
__label__Evidence	people will make will  still use the smaller section for hate speech
__label__Position	I think hate speech should be regulated rather than the comment space being removed. I believe that there is technology in place that could filter out any hate speech so that everyone may be able to express their opinion without offending anyone. I also believe that people can get their message across without discriminating against anyone
__label__Evidence	However it might not stop some people as they could believe that their opinion is correct and not hate.
__label__Evidence	Adapting to climate change may require controversial changes in land use
__label__Evidence	I dont agree with this as sure it counters the hate speech but that makes me question the reliability of the news article
__label__Evidence	Name and shame those that want to spout hate, I agree.
__label__Evidence	Research and twenty one years experience suggests that there is little doubt that many people from different parts of civil society feel disconnected or excluded from environmental action and discussion at just the time when the environmental sector is working to develop and expand engagement. There is is a need on both sides to be heard, listened to and understood.
__label__Evidence	Early engagement allows better understanding of concerns
__label__Evidence	No alternative views
__label__Position	Removing the option to comment is limiting engagement, but hate speech should be moderated and dealt with by having people create an account and fill in a name.
__label__Position	human rights of the masses should not be violated regardless of their beliefs and views
__label__Evidence	As citizens we can put pressure on our elected policy makers to put their time, money, and funding into this cause. 
__label__Position	The NHS, the cost of living, and the shambles that is the current government
__label__Evidence	there is a difference between hate speech and an opposite view
__label__Position	There should be hate speech words that should be used to warn the user and not allow them to post by disabling the post button if there are hate speech words.
__label__Evidence	This is a very good point. And will make the reading experience pleasant. Another method that can combat hate speech is education. When it comes to bullying, cyberbullying, harassment, and hate crimes, the more people are educated on these issues, the more we can prevent them in the future.
__label__Position	I am concerned about the high level of immigration, both legal and illegal. I am also concerned by a laissez faire attitude to some crimes which makes people feel that they are unsafe and not listened to
__label__Evidence	i think most immigrants in this country work and fill essential jobs. 
__label__Position	waiting times for ambulances, hospital beds
__label__Evidence	I agree 100%. It's too easy to shut down all speech, just because someone gets offended by things that they do not agree with. This will only then attract the bullies and trolls who want to shout down anyone who isn't in lock step with their own narrow viewpoint.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers ARE these platforms, or should be, in my opinion. Why not allow news to be challenged in the place where it is presented? Why risk leaving it unchallenged?
__label__Position	hate speech is a reflection of two sides of a story ,all side of the story need to be published to allow the public to make up their own minds .
__label__Evidence	It does feel like you can't be proud to be British without being apologetic. Weird really. 
__label__Evidence	We need a change 
__label__Position	I have less idea what the H is happening on here than I do with our country??
__label__Position	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__Evidence	Society needs to change, desperately
__label__Evidence	I think in the cases of newspapers, the hateful comments can be removed before print. If it's an online platform then said user can be shadowed
__label__Evidence	Does not allow for positive feedback
__label__Evidence	It is nice to think we could reduce hate speech.
__label__Position	i think the use of a moderator would help but also a warning or disclaimer should be put out for readers, it should clearly state what is considered hate speech and what the consequences for the reader's comment will be if they are found to contain hate speech.
__label__Position	The leadership of the paries
__label__Position	But the virtual world its not a problem. we as people are the ones with unresolved matters
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	the tory government has destroyed this country with their selfish politics
__label__Position	I fear Labour will try to take us back into the EU
__label__Position	There shouldn't be hate speeches if the articles don't provoke it. The newspaper has to take charge of what it can provoke to its reader, and thus avoid those speeches. The comment space shouldn't be removed.
__label__Evidence	The EU s historical complexities with Jewish issues make it hesitant to act decisively
__label__Evidence	Having rules will make online engagement respectful.
__label__Position	I do think that comments sections online can be a bit of a breeding ground for hate speech and racist, sexist and xenophobic comments. If one person comments something that falls into one of these categories, and encourages others. I think this is wider problem for society though, and living in a country that has freedom of speech I don't think we should censor what people think or what to say. I think more needs to be done to educate, rather than ban. Its a very tough question of how as a society we tackle this. I don't think the governments actions (such as brexit) have helped matters as there seems to be more of divide now than before.
__label__Evidence	"""The issue of consistency is a HUGE one. As a sector, we do our best but the Public Sector should focus on things such as the skill gap for instance"" (Chris Jofeh, Consultant to Arup and Chair of the independent Decarbonisation of Homes in Wales Advisory Group)"
__label__Evidence	I believe moderation should occur instead of total removal to allow people. to express their views
__label__Position	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__Evidence	it would take a lot of time before the news are released
__label__Evidence	Essentially agree on all of these plus add the NHS and social care
__label__Position	hate speech cannot be fairly reduced. Either you moderate it and will remove what some deem to be unfairly some kind of speech or you don't moderate it and allow hate speech to exist on the platform.
__label__Evidence	My experiences with waiting lists over the past 2 years have been good. Have needed physio and mother needed hip op, both were seen quickly. So, although i know waiting lists must be a problem for certain patients, it's not for everyone and not top of my priority list 
__label__Evidence	they have been abysmal 
__label__Evidence	This is maybe accurate if you were a conservative voter and are not sure what to vote for, but as a leftist, the reform party offers me nothing and I dont want them anywhere near our government 
__label__Position	i feel incredibly conflicted about this, the simplest solution i feel is to make sure there are moderators who control the chat , although i imagine there would be resistance to this on behalf of the newspaper / platform as it would be costly .. if this cannot be done i feel it would be simply far simpler to remove the chat space entirely and allow the discussion to take place somewhere esle.
__label__Position	People have a right to free speech and the responsibility to ensure that their views do not violate anyone's right (https://www.fordfoundation.org/news-and-stories/big-ideas/with-four-freedoms-four-responsibilities/with-the-freedom-of-speech-the-responsibility-to-listen/), therefore blocking anyone who doesn't use their right to free speech responsibly shouldn't be a problem
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately, people do seem to struggle with self-censorship, especially when anonymous  and hidden behind a keyboard.
__label__Evidence	It is important to actually define what hate speech is before an agreed education policy can be enacted.
__label__Evidence	that will still allow people to write hate speech, coz they can.
__label__Position	Cost of living, education and housing.
__label__Evidence	I tend to agree with this as the problem of entrenched ideas is increased with the echo chamber approach to collecting infrmation
__label__Evidence	have profiles that are always flagged totally blocked
__label__Position	I think comments should definitely not be deleted. It's a lazy way of reducing free speech.
__label__Position	NHS waiting lists are definitely something that needs ot be improved, but 100% not with tax increase. we pay enough already. the whole system needs a review
__label__Evidence	agree- too busy lining their own pockets
__label__Evidence	What will take place tomorrow will be theatre. The problem is the system as a whole. The real power lies with the banks and financial institutions. Whichever party is in government they are subservant to these financial powers. We need a new financial system which is not a debt based fiat system. 
__label__Position	Peer reviews of reporting comments should be checked by at least two moderators with two different background in order to facilitate the process and prevent review bombing instead of policing hate speeach
__label__Evidence	and pro at the same time..?
__label__Evidence	Lots of politicians are a bit out of touch with actual reality
__label__Evidence	Verification of identity is a useful suggestion as users may be more scared of consequences if they can be identified from their comments.
__label__Position	In as much as there comment section shouldn't be eliminated completely, maybe evaluating and deleting comments that have hate speech.
__label__Position	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Evidence	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	NHS and Education
__label__Position	I think that officials are wanting to remove the ability for free speech because they want to control what and how members of the public think.
__label__Evidence	there is no hate speech
__label__Position	The newspapers can disable the comment space when they believe that a specific article may result in some discrimination. They could also monitor the comment section and delete comments that may be offensive.
__label__Position	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__Position	Probably won’t vote as no one is addressing the key issues with conviction, it’s all sound bites bad hot air
__label__Evidence	hopefully this doesnt happen 
__label__Position	we cannot eliminate all contributions nor reduce free speech but all newspapers and content providers must acknowledge the role they play in spreading hate and disinformation
__label__Evidence	Not allowing hateful comment does not mean we limit people freedom of speech but promote kindness.
__label__Position	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments
__label__Evidence	But is it even possible to fix now or is it too far gone?
__label__Position	Human populations are approaching carrying capacity on planet Earth. The scientific community thinks this is a number on the order of 9 to 10 billion people. Without population control, there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of human-induced climate change.
__label__Position	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__Evidence	Not worth the paper they're written on
__label__Position	NHS, Cost of Living, Corruption, Lying politicians, PPE fraud
__label__Position	first thing was where to vote 
__label__Position	I am up for not killing animals therefore just a vegetarian diet would do. But I would not stop eating animal products (eggs, milk, dairy, honey, etc.) as long this has been sourced ethically 
__label__Position	Allow the speech, then allow other users to rebuke it.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	Removing the comments section can eliminate hate speech but also eliminates the ability for other readers to have a healthy discussion about the topic and add their own opinions and views. I think using a moderator or AI to moderate content could be a good way of eliminating hate speech. Or have a report button so that other readers can report such comments.
__label__Evidence	Who now gets to determine the criteria, and what is topping them from being bias?
__label__Evidence	If carbon dioxide emissions were to decrease, the absorption of carbon dioxide by plant life and through the oceans would remain the same. I think millions of years is a very pessimistic estimate. Our planet tends to balance itself out within a shorter time frame. 
__label__Evidence	Reader comments and opinions would be very beneficial towards newspapers as these comments could start meaningful conversations and introduce new perspective to the newspapers, and help readers be able to gain more understanding of topics by reading what other people think.

__label__Evidence	But the prisons are full
__label__Evidence	Yup! its always the case 
__label__Evidence	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.
__label__Evidence	While I agree, there are a lot of things that have to happen first before this can become a reality. We have to rework gas stations around the country so that they have the charging stations necessary for electric vehicles and we have to build the charging stations near highways and thoroughfares for those same electric cars so that the future infrastructure is ready to handle the influx of electric cars before demanding they be manufactured at such a high rate.
__label__Evidence	it removes the right of freedom of speech
__label__Position	We all seem to be in agreement so far
__label__Evidence	Newspapers in print have a comments section that you can write in to give your opinions on, but the replies are moderated and checked.  Online versions should have the same ability, differences of opinion should be embraced not stopped and can be moderated to ensure no hate speech is written within those opinions.
__label__Position	This is a fine point. I agree wholeheartedly with you. Education and showing people how to engage in proper discourse is key. I would also add to this that people need to learn how to receive other people's opinions without taking it personally or being overly sensitive. Overall, this is an interesting problem facing society with the advent of the internet and social media.

__label__Position	in terms of hate speech, rules and regulations should be in place to control how people express themselves without hurting others.
__label__Position	"As I said before, using the AI is a good option for filtering comments. According to this article https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443720957562, moderators have difficulties separating ""uncivil speech"" so I think we need to use AI to filter comments."

__label__Position	Is this being monitored
__label__Evidence	agree. economy very important 
__label__Evidence	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Position	I think that people need to take a deeper look into the amount of hate speech that actually occurs online. We need to start at the root of the problem. Check out some informatiion from Stop Hate UK.. https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/
__label__Evidence	i feel that the education policy may not be the best idea as people may not listen/take in the advice as advised,meaning they could go back onto the website and write something similar due to just not caring at all
__label__Evidence	The law! People break the law through hate speech, so the law needs to be the judge.

__label__Position	Reduce the number of comments.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can cause unnecessary harm and the removal of a space for readers comments would overall be a good thing that would not take away from the experience of reading the articles.
__label__Evidence	Algorithm not always working
__label__Evidence	If we don't ask corporations to step in and get involved, then we're ignoring the biggest contributor of this issue - EVERYBODY needs to be involved. 
__label__Position	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__Evidence	Yes, NHS funding and reform after being pumped by the tories for many years

__label__Evidence	makes the comments more welcoming to everyone
__label__Evidence	Because it's the only thing that could actually work
__label__Position	I don't think hate speech should be allowed because it can cause more hate if readers agree so i think the comments should be monitored.

__label__Position	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__Evidence	Fully agree with this!
__label__Evidence	I agree, everyone has the right to their opinion and to express it
__label__Evidence	Internet education is definitely needed
__label__Position	labour's leadership team is weak
__label__Position	They have ruined the NHS
__label__Evidence	I agree. We already have lumber shortages as it is and this will only get worse as time goes on unless we do something. Deforestation has caused a lot of issues and reversing that could go a long way in helping to stabilize the climate once again.
__label__Evidence	Under current laws, restauranters are responsible for hate speech among their diners, so I certainly think platform owners should be responsible for the presence of hate speech on their websites. Hate speech is a criminal offence, after all.
__label__Position	Comments should be monitored and hate comments should be deleted immediately and those who engage in those activities regularly should be banned from using the platform
__label__Position	There are a number of different factors that have been important to me in terms of deciding how to vote, these include: repercussions of Brexit, who is dealing with migrants in the most humane way, how COVID was dealt with, which party is going to help out first time buyers
__label__Position	Key issues: lack of trust in both major parties
__label__Position	Also, it is always better to do something than nothing, and then regretting it.
__label__Position	People who choose to comment on newspapers articles are usually not a representative sample of the general population. Depending on which platform you are on, the views and opinions might be skewed. However, that can open the doors to interesting discussions. Moderating comments is a better approach when trying to get rid of hate speech
__label__Position	Comment boxes should not be deleted. As discussed in the Times (https://time.com/5770755/threat-free-speech-online/) it's difficult to say whether responsibility for hate speech posted is on the newespaper or individual people.
__label__Position	NHS, Immigration, Cost of Living, Taxes
__label__Position	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__Position	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__Position	Thank you for this!, this is a great idea
__label__Evidence	Agree rich should be taxed more. Council tax needs reform 
__label__Evidence	Agree. We bought our first house over COVID and overnight they took all the 10%-deposit mortgages away. We were very fortunate to have enough saved for 15% but I always wonder how many people lost out on their dream house overnight. Granted that was during a pandemic but with the interest rates now, I assume it's just as difficult.
__label__Evidence	No, thats your mum.

__label__Evidence	Yes, it's disgraceful
__label__Evidence	I don't think the best education policy will combat trolls, bad faith actors or targeted/well orchestrated hate campaigns.
__label__Evidence	quite an optimistic way to see it 
__label__Evidence	New ideas and thoughts emerge from the comments. New opinions.
__label__Position	I really think that there should be properly paid moderators to do this work.  People need employment, and I think many people would be happy to do this.
__label__Position	tories can be such hypocrites let alone the extreme right, their effect has been devastating all over the globe!
__label__Position	the key issues for me are education and health

__label__Position	something defnitely have to be done to the NHS, but further tay raises is not the answer. It's the whole system the issue. that no one doctor can make a decision, it has to go through on several different levels etc. and just makes so much longer
__label__Evidence	If you don't vote, you don't really have the right to share your opinion and you aren't registered as engaging. Go and spoil your ballot if you must, but please turn up and use the British Value of Democracy to show what you think!  
__label__Position	Comment section is very good to have so that people can freely voice their opinion like a gazette or white paper for government. Can be reduced by creating a filter out programe to remove key words of hate speech
__label__Position	Economy and immigration
__label__Position	Cost of living, taxation, NHS..
__label__Position	policing the comments section for hate speech is very much possible and can be effective. we cannot allow hate speech to prevail while its having a negative impact on people and there measures which we can put in place. take a look at this article attached with a link https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Position	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__Evidence	no you cant control peoples behaviours but what you also cant control is peoples abilities to have an opinion. we all need to have a say, hence what twitter is full off .
__label__Evidence	Many cultures include meat of some kind as part of their daily choices. Veganism as a movement reflects just a small part of humanity.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely agree,and public opinion seems to favour this approach.
__label__Evidence	but if you were in charge what would your priority be?
__label__Position	This statement was inspired and taken from Secretary General (https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/hate-speech-is-not-free-speech-says-secretary-general-ahead-of-human-rights-day) I am a firm believer that we are all entitled to freedom of speech. I am also a believer that nobody should feel threatened after sharing a written piece in a newspaper. The easy access to comment sections is drawing out the wrong type of people who post extreme forms of hate. I do not believe that this is the correct exercise of free speech. There are many ways we can share opinions, but attacking people online is not the way. Hate comments should be banned
__label__Evidence	Labour surely can't be more untrustworthy than the tories have been!
__label__Evidence	working to engage those people described as disengaged or ‘hard-to-reach’ does not need to be a priority when so much else needs to be done as well. 
__label__Position	Websites need to be held accounbtable for hate speech
__label__Evidence	there should be a universal basic income but it'll never happen unfortunately
__label__Evidence	I don't think that's true anymore - working in a large corporation, 5 years ago, we would have never talked about sustainability, been willing to pay more for anything sustainable, or frankly, really been concerned. Now, we have no real choice - consumers are simply demanding it. 
__label__Evidence	Newspapers can't be one sided, they should give a balanced, fair point of view
__label__Evidence	But public opinion would be silenced, which is bad for democracy.
__label__Evidence	It will help stop hate speech which is very important
__label__Evidence	Its open to gaming, ie getting stories taken down
__label__Position	It needs to be monitored, perhaps by an algorythm.
__label__Position	I want to feel like the party I vote for isn;t just going to be a load of chancers looking for a meal ticket like the current lot. Labour are giving me the confidence to vote for them in that regard for sure... 
__label__Evidence	yes, I feel that if freedom of speech incites violence against a person or a specific race then it should not be permitted.
__label__Position	""" Recommendation 5: Preventive Measures Social media companies and other internet intermediaries should adopt proactive policies that are consistent with international human rights standards and that are designed to prevent the dissemination of prohibited hate speech before it causes different forms of harm. They should harness reliable algorithms for natural-language processing and reliable sentiment analysis tools, whose decisions are subject to meaningful human review and challenge mechanisms, and employ their own internal trained content reviewers, with the aim of improving the identification of hate speech,curtailing the virality of prohibited harmful content, and/or allowing users to apply filters to block offensive content they do not wish to be exposed to. Social media companies and other internet intermediaries should also take steps to render their policies and rules visible and easily accessible to users, presented in a concise, transparent, and intelligible manner and written in clear and plain language, including examples of permissible and impermissible content. With the goal of discouraging users from resorting to hate speech, these proactive policies should be designed to foster understanding of the relevant policies and rules and employ culturally sensitive awareness-raising measures, which might include explaining how certain expressions or images might be perceived by affected individuals or groups."" https://www.idi.org.il/media/13570/recommendations-for-reducing-online-hate-speech.pdf"
__label__Position	Increase citizen responsibility and participation
__label__Evidence	You can't complain about anything if you don't vote. If you do vote and lose you can always blame the people that voted for the party that messes the country up. 
__label__Position	I think the comment section should be open for people to participate in because this helps p[eople understand the information more and what peoples onions are but they should definitely be regulated and anyone that is nasty hating or threatening should be banned.
__label__Evidence	I absolutely agree that people need to have an outlet to share their opinion, whatever that is. And the only reason to really turn comments off is where someone is seeking information, and have their answer/are satisfied with the response; but on a news site, I feel like blocking comments is a cop out for a controversial story, or to protect the sources feelings rather than giving the public a right to have a say.
__label__Position	The NHS, Relationship with Europe, Taxation, economy, integrity of leader and party.
__label__Evidence	would authors be held to account still?
__label__Position	By outright banning IP addresses which contribute hate speech to platforms, and investing in moderation through human resources and through text analysis tools.
__label__Position	Polarization is primarily driven by identity and emotional divides rather than disagreement on facts
__label__Evidence	A coordinated programme would be useful, but where do we start to build it? And Who should launch it?
__label__Evidence	Reduces spam/scam comments as well as hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Requires a lot of moderation
__label__Evidence	Yep, fully agree with this
__label__Position	I very much agree to this, as that would help us arrive at the same time. 
__label__Evidence	A combination of volunteer human and algorithm moderation is already used on sites like Reddit. While it's not perfect, it's less rigid than fully automated moderation and allows communities to set their own rules.
__label__Position	Moderation of deliberately antagonists, false or posts inciting hate should be conducted.  Training on bias, education on the subject would help
__label__Evidence	I agree, there are other ways to put your point across without trying to make other people look bad 
__label__Position	having comments moderated to ensure no harmful things get posted
__label__Evidence	Integrity does seem to be in short supply
__label__Evidence	All in all, the newspaper comment section should not be cancelled.
__label__Position	I don't believe that removing the comment section would reduce free speech at all. It's not removing your ability to talk about the article on a forum or with friends/family. I feel as though it's just removing it from an area where it is usually found in abundance. I can't begin to count how many times an articles comment section just turns into people spewing hate speech because they disagree with the content.
__label__Evidence	No comments at all would eliminate hateful comments
__label__Position	There should be some level of censoring applied
__label__Evidence	Not allowing anonymous posts will turn off individuals from commenting, that's limiting the ideas that others could have contributed
__label__Evidence	Measurement alone is not enough without action
__label__Evidence	I leave below a link to the study I mentioned above but was not able to attach and I am curious to hear what is others opinion. https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/
__label__Evidence	Absolutely agree with this. Newspapers will moderate comments that do not agree with their agenda.
__label__Position	Turning off the comment section reduces the average time spent on news websites, a study has found, and it did not leave a good impression on those who noticed that their comments were removed. https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/10/research-proves-that-removing-comment.html
__label__Position	Use a BOT to regulate hateful comments
__label__Evidence	However, we need a solution for this, else we may not be able to have any platforms at all.
__label__Position	Ensure beforehand that readers understand what is going on and what is required of them. Discipline is key.
__label__Position	Creating neutral spaces around interest, where the public is invited to contribute according to their level of expertise/knowledge/interest 
__label__Position	We need to improve communication to consumers about sustainable food choices
__label__Position	a proper solution is that by having a vote system the comments can be deleted by reaching to a specific point.
__label__Evidence	The downside to this is who is going to moderate it - where is the baseline of what is acceptable and what is not.  It's a real challenge.
__label__Position	Probity, truth of claims, the economy, benefitsn and whether I feel that any of the promises made are actually achievable
__label__Evidence	What you are suggesting means that free speech should be limited to those articles that won't generate a conversation.  If you look at  https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/news-sites-that-turn-off-commenting-dont-drive-users-to-social-media-instead/ it shows that restricting or reducing comments can inflame a situation and cause irrational and trolling.
__label__Position	Many are saying that any form of moderation or removing comment sections is censorship, and that hate speech is just an inevitable fact of life, but moderating hate speech is arguably key to protecting and nurturing free speech. See this argument from the United Nations: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech

__label__Evidence	Slows down discussion.
__label__Evidence	i think most voting in northern ireland is tactical. There's the usual green and orange parties and some good people in the middle ground that have never historically got much traction because most people will vote for the party that they've always voted for. I'm hoping that will change this year 
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	There are certain steps we can take to help with climate change. Just sitting back sayin that nothing can be done isn't helping anything. We need to step up and take steps toward improving the situation.
__label__Position	In my area it has been important to vote tactically, I really want to get the tories out, so Lib Dems were a close second and won in the council elections, so I will be voting them, eithet though I'd rather vote for Greens policies, I particularly like their wealth tax
__label__Evidence	i agree, there should be monitors to stop this practise
__label__Position	safe spaces for women 
__label__Position	another issue that needs considering is how those being accused of hate speech will frame their comments in relation to any ban/comment removal, as can be seen here : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X19301159 there will be a way for people to defend their comments against censorship, putting newspapers in a difficult position regarding upholding free speech while also preventing free speech. this is a  minefield to navigate for papers. however it is an important issue
__label__Evidence	It could help others have an opinion but in a positive non hurtful way
__label__Evidence	It can help improve efficiency and sustainability of production

__label__Position	Enforcing what to eat to people is against principle of freedom - even if we talk about dietary options
__label__Evidence	there might be a negative effect on the newspaper being sold
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is possible without using hate speech.  Hate speech should be regulated as it can constitute a crime. The problem with online comment space is that people commenting aren't accountable for what they write.  So, unless there is a system where ID is used to set up an account to make comments, then the best solution is to allow comments but to regulate it, moderate it and ensure there are filters so that comments exhibiting racist, homophobic, misogynistic, etc language is removed and the person trying to post such comments are blocked from future commenting.
__label__Evidence	Do you believe that a newspaper comment section is an appropriate system for dialogue with someone spreading hateful messages?
__label__Position	electric vehicles should be consider as mandatory by the major fuel consumption nations 
__label__Evidence	not a bad idea
__label__Evidence	I disagree and believe that other views should be respected and be allowed to be aired.  If we only read one particular newspaper then our view will become one sided, with a comments section arguing different points, then it opens us up to many other arguments.
__label__Position	As I mentioned earlier, it is not that hard to achieve a hate speech free online community through the use of moderators and bots. Here is a link to reddit's volunteer moderator guidelines they use to help their moderators be better. https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moddiquette/ If it's possible to achieve it with volunteers, imagine the effect you can have with paid and educated moderators.  Another way of handling this would be to force people out of their anonimity by making it necessary to use their real ID to create an account on newspaper websites just like prolific and putting comments as a member only tool. By the addition of laws that take hate speech online as serious as hate speech on the streets, people could be fined for their inappropriate behaviour and possibly shunned in the society, just like they would in real life.
__label__Evidence	"People engaged in constructive dialogue where different opinions are seen as contributions leads to more effective decision-making.

__label__Position	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.

__label__Position	The thing is that parties like reform are very good at persuasive speech and knowing what to say but telling what their true beliefs are rather than what theyre saying jjust to make us like them is difficult!

__label__Position	Homeless irradicated.
__label__Position	"Well I think it just comes down to the companies running the comment section. They need to prioritise curbing hate speech in their comments. But that costs them money and they may not want to do it. I don't think you can ever make it ""fair"" but at the end of the day it's a private company and they can ban hate speech if they want to"
__label__Position	Perhaps moderators could be required to act proactively (approving posts before they're public) rather than reactively (deleting etc).
__label__Evidence	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/
__label__Evidence	Everyone is entitled to their opinions
__label__Position	People need to be filtered if their they not talking about the set topic in the comment section, freedom if speech is abused.
__label__Evidence	I have to agree with DamianC above, I notice a lot of hate speech on twitter for example and I feel this would if anything create more problems as they would have zero control over the platform.
__label__Position	Get immigration numbers down and stop the illegal boats
__label__Position	In summary, there's no one rule. There have been comments about education but this is out of scope if we seek to address a current problem. There's a balance to be struck between moderation and free speech, clearly making users aware of what constitues hate speech/abuse and making consistent and graded responses to that, in the most efficient ways possible is the solution rather than banning comments altogether.
__label__Position	writing in the box
__label__Evidence	Veganism is a choice, it should not be forced - especially to children 
__label__Position	I think moderation is required, along with algorithms to detect certain words or phrases known to be problematic
__label__Position	Another alternative is to turn our attention towards what 'Free speech' really means and consider re-wording or amending the constitution. This however is requires changes at a government level.
__label__Evidence	This may
__label__Position	inflation is going down so conservatives deserve a chance
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.
__label__Evidence	 The leadership styles of the two parties are markedly different. In my view, Keir Starmer has demonstrated significantly stronger leadership compared to Rishi Sunak. Starmer has shown a clear vision and decisiveness in addressing key issues. However, there is still room for improvement. Starmer could enhance his leadership by being more proactive in policy development and more transparent in his decision-making processes. Meanwhile, Sunak's leadership has lacked the same level of clarity and direction, which has been a disadvantage during these challenging times. Both leaders have the potential to grow, but currently, Starmer stands out as the more effective leader, albeit with areas where he can still improve.
__label__Position	low wage rises for public sector
__label__Position	I believe that this whole debate has been had. What needs to be implemented not just in regards to election matters or health related matters is a fact checker system available on all sites like one that was available on twitter. See here for more details https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/03/twitter-birdwatch-fact-check-misinfo-test/
__label__Position	I believe that the comments section should allow coments from everyone, however newspapers should be duty bound to provide in person moderation for the comments section to monitor for hate speech. I am unsure if there is an AI sensitive enough to police hate speech around difficut issues yet so as of now I think any moderation would have to be carried out by a person or be counity lead.
__label__Position	We need to proactively communicate and address public concerns early
__label__Position	NHS, taxes and immigration 
__label__Evidence	This comes back to the idea of people thinking they know what is best for the majority, even if they hold a very polarised view. You only need to look at the current gender critical movement to see this. https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-won-t-graham-norton-speak-up-for-jk-rowling-
__label__Position	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__Position	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__Evidence	names give us some sort of power over the person we call
__label__Evidence	Yes, and also being able to see a GP, not having to wait 2 weeks just to get a phone call
__label__Position	The worst thing we could do would be to continue to do nothing. That's what's gotten us into this mess in the first place. Technology is evolving rapidly; think of all the changes and advancements that have been made in the recent past. Perhaps a solution is around the corner and we just don't know what it is yet. We cannot give up.
__label__Evidence	We need to express ourselves as the public.
__label__Evidence	Using moderators and flagging can be abused to prevent valid comments. If the moderator doesn't like what you have written, or if there are several users who doesn't like you on the platform, they can abuse the flagging. Just look at YouTube and how many abuse the flagging to get rid of a channel or person who they don't agree with and who have strong opinions you don't agree with.
__label__Evidence	moderator could remove the part of sentence and not the whole post instead, so that the entire post is not unreadable, the person could have a valid point, just not written it in a  better way,
__label__Evidence	A very good point. So-called hate speech is often used by leftists to silence political opponents.
__label__Evidence	The can has been kicked down the road so often that it IS now pressing.  The sooner we act the more we protect our kids.  Also we won't lose out in international trade to those who are investing more and sooner in green tech 
__label__Evidence	it has to be completely restricted
__label__Evidence	Social media is designed to be addictive and can negatively impact mental health
__label__Evidence	Yes, a slow and deliberate decline.
__label__Position	it is impossible to predict the future price of a commodity, especially in such long term as 6 months. Having said that, you can always speculate considering the current geopolitical and economic prospects. I would assume that investors will prefer hard commodity (like gold or real estate) over other soft financial assets (e.g. stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc.)
__label__Position	I agree with DamianC that we should start training AI to eliminate this kind of hate speach
__label__Position	Education, pensions, the triple lock and pensioners being taxed, along with the housing chaos are important points for me.
__label__Position	Personally, I do not mind hate speech. It does not offend me. For the readers that are offended by it, they should have ways to eliminate it by maybe having the option to not see positions that contain certain words for them. Each reader should have the option to choose which words they regard as hate speech.
__label__Position	Every year that passes we lose tools or opportiunities that could work to counteract climate change as well as more damage is added - therefore is -unfortunately- irrevrsible
__label__Evidence	Changing the age of teachers is not the solution to education system problems

__label__Position	592a6f9190cb9b000105e5de   cost of living crisis and paying for food and housing and energy 
__label__Evidence	I agree that hate speech blocking reduces abuse, but abusers will find a way around it and discussion may be curbed accidentally. The issue with comments sections is the comments section itself, not just what's in them.
__label__Position	Shift towards nuclear energy
__label__Position	By encouraging witneses and victims of hate speech to report hate speech on the internet
__label__Evidence	I think they hold some responsibility. But perhaps not in the way this survey is trying to determine. A free flow of ideas is necessary, which includes difficult and often cantankerous and vigorous differing opinions. It should be the responsibility of said sites to allow those types of opinions, but deal with the trolls that free and open debate often attract.
__label__Evidence	Already we are ruin the nature to observe the CO2 and other gases.Now we are expecting the solution in technology side.It is not fully solution for change the climate.So we want to focus the nature resources management.
__label__Evidence	But the perpetrator of said hate speech should also be informed as to what they did wrong. Sometimes people might do these things out of simple ignorance and others are just genuine and deliberate in their actions.
__label__Position	The editor must appoint a diverse panel, meaning from different backgrounds to screen comments
__label__Position	NHS, Immigration, Education, Crime
__label__Evidence	The NHS and Education need alot more resource and funding 
__label__Position	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__Evidence	Self-opinion is illogical at times, but people are entitled to whatever non-harmful opinions they like. Except in the case of psychics and other charlatans.
__label__Position	By simply educating people about what harm hate speech can do to a person
__label__Position	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post.  Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)
__label__Evidence	Will allow anyone to have a comment where necessary
__label__Position	According to https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=a57e541240ed3b9bJmltdHM9MTY2NjIyNDAwMCZpZ3VpZD0xNDgwZDNmYy03ZTI1LTYzYzMtMGZiZC1kZDNiN2ZkZDYyOTAmaW5zaWQ9NTI0NA&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=1480d3fc-7e25-63c3-0fbd-dd3b7fdd6290&psq=how+to+reduce+hate+speech+online&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjb252ZXJzYXRpb24uY29tL2EtYmV0dGVyLXdheS10by1yZWd1bGF0ZS1vbmxpbmUtaGF0ZS1zcGVlY2gtcmVxdWlyZS1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtY29tcGFuaWVzLXRvLWJlYXItYS1kdXR5LW9mLWNhcmUtdG8tdXNlcnMtMTYzODA4&ntb=1 The Act creates a complaints-based system for removing harmful material, and in some cases the eSafety commissioner has the power to block sites. It also has a wide remit in terms of its coverage of a variety of online services. Yet, it only tackles a few specific types of harm, not the full spectrum of harmful speech.
__label__Position	Educating the masses to tolerate is a must in todays society. You will always have trolls but the general public that is easily swayed by media need education that diversity is important and not a bad thing. Media needs to take responsibility in how it shapes peoples thoughts.
__label__Position	NHS, Scottish Independence and cost of living.
__label__Evidence	journalists views become one sided, people can not engage to support.disagree
__label__Evidence	my thoughts exactly..Hate speech can also be helpful in improving the news papers.
__label__Position	It needs moderation of the website . If people cannot understand what hate speech, then that is their problem. Hate speech causes deaths.
__label__Evidence	The algorithm could be really bad at catching irony which can be really harmful as well.
__label__Evidence	"I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that ""less restricted"" criteria should be?"
__label__Position	Free speech is important to provide an opportunity for everyone to examine an issue from many perspectives.  I like the idea of moderators and/or approved profiles of contributors to the discussion to enable a discussion free of hate.
__label__Evidence	I disagree. This limits the freedom of speech of people and for people to be able to give their opinion and potentially challenge the thoughts of the newspaper. I agree that this should be done in a respectful way.
__label__Position	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__Position	Taxes, environment, healthcare, immigration
__label__Position	Economy, taxation, healthcare/NHS, immigration, environment
__label__Position	There should be no comment area in order to limit hate speech. Newspapers should be one-sided sources of information.
__label__Evidence	I agree, making it harder for hate speech to be posted through filters etc makes more sense than to remove a space where people can have genuine discussions.
__label__Evidence	The problem is that hate speech laws differ from country to country. The UN has a set of rules (https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech?gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966B8prXQ12vsyA9iPNzeoJiBpSFAuLJFh4j4_h5QJe48gd8MVKZ4eHQaAiPWEALw_wcB) but that does not mean all countries obey and follow them. Taking away opinion from topics would mean you would not know how other feel about an topic or article all in the name of hate speech. Therefore, it would create a miss understood society.
__label__Position	A lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with. I think that anything that is removed should be explained to the poster as well as the impact that t could have on other people
__label__Evidence	I agree - Starmer's Labour have exhiled political representatives that embodied Labour and ordinarily left-wing values. Starmer's Labour = Tory Lite 
__label__Position	Future of the YTs
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion? 
__label__Position	While I support open discussion, I also think that thorough moderation is difficult. Do you rely solely on humans or do you use some type of software? How do you define hate speech on your platform? And what when open discussion turns into an additional platform for these hateful messages? I think there is still a lot to talk about- but again, I agree that banning commenting overall (and openly with a portion of accountability attached to it) is not the solution.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this comment
__label__Evidence	Since most of the climate change is caused by big organisations, I dont think just adapting to climate change is the right thing to say. There is a lot that is out of our hands.
__label__Position	Evverybody should be able to express their opinions weather it iis critism or not at the end of the day comments are needed
__label__Position	NHS underfunded and badly run
__label__Position	I think that it depends a lot on ow the comment section is presented - is it an extension of the article itself or a separate section that needs to be viewed separately. How much legitimacy is the the platform giving to the comment section.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this, and don't have much confidence that it will change with a change of government. I feel that all of the manifestos either state something unrealistic or that I just don't believe 
__label__Evidence	I disagree, people know the damage but do not care.  They hide behind relative anonymity and so do not worry about what people think of their posts.  Like many things, you can educate as much as you want but if people choose not to listen it will make no difference
__label__Evidence	people can share creative ideas and hateful words and ideas are not used
__label__Evidence	We should aim to heat people :) not buildings (Cherry)
__label__Evidence	Yes. This will prevent the probability of danger that hate speech usually causes.
__label__Position	The two-state solution is no longer viable
__label__Evidence	agree - need to reduce waiting lists
__label__Position	It would be appropiate to to reduce the commenting on certain parts of the webpage to stop the hatred and racism or even block out certain words so people who genually want to reply can do so without people aiming there remarks at them in the comments section.
__label__Evidence	Education is a mess, particularly if you have a child with special needs. Months and months to battle for an EHCP and still no real help
__label__Position	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__Position	I think they should pick up certain words or those that reflect hate speech in it's contect before being submitted.
__label__Position	Poor leadership of the parties
__label__Evidence	number 1 issue for me
__label__Evidence	we have alternate way to think this problem. human population control is may be possible one way. but other way we have to follow and find alternate solution for this climate change problems like find reusable energy sources and green sources. mainly control co2 pollution through vehicles. 
__label__Evidence	"""EU is going to give a carbon credit for buildings that have been there for a long time"" (Peter Cox)"
__label__Position	Some words could be put in the software and removed or censored when detected. This is not too hard to be done and will not eliminate the freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Needs to be addressed in a constructive and positive way. I don't think we are anywhere near where we should be on this.
__label__Position	Newspapers should not be treated as fora for individuals to share opinions, and only deliver factual basis for news
__label__Position	I think what should be prioritized is the option to let people say their perspective. It is difficult to ensure that no one promotes hate speech, but we should be able to allow people to say what they would like to say, following strict guidelines provided by the website. Are we fighting harm or are we silencing dissent? https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2021/07/moderating-online-content-fighting-harm-or-silencing-dissent
__label__Position	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__Position	I think there should be freedom of speech and expression of opinions. However, people should get an education first in order to create a positive and useful environment. 
__label__Evidence	I completely agree, the internet already needed policies to stop hate speech or insults.
__label__Evidence	I totally agree.
__label__Evidence	An easy and inexpensive way to stop hateful comments
__label__Position	The summary of ideas in this topic is related to reducing hate speech in newspapers websites without eliminating the space for reader's comments. Many people are suggesting that moderators should be put in place to moderate each comment and approve it if it meets the required standards. Other debaters are arguing that there should be systems put in place to detect hate speech words and I think that would be a great initiative because it will help and ensure that the website space is conducive.
__label__Evidence	As much people have freedom of speech we are also obliged to respect other people whilst doing so.
__label__Position	newspapers should not have a comments section.
__label__Position	no, they could add some extension like IG to restrict some words and monitor comments as well. I believe removing hate speech is not against freedom-of-speech
__label__Evidence	Sharing how we all have learning from failure is very refreshing
__label__Evidence	It's a good idea to reduce anonymity so more people can be linked to the things they say and rightly may think twice about coming across as a hateful person.
__label__Position	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more 
__label__Evidence	great comment, thanks for adding verified sources which strengthens these ideas
__label__Evidence	I believe we still can. We could live amore local life
__label__Position	By having an algorithm that detects and  deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__Position	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__Evidence	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.
__label__Position	Cost of living, LGBTQIA+ rights, NHS
__label__Position	If I feel I can trust what the politicians say
__label__Position	comments should be monitored by AI for certain phrases and reactions. A reporting feature can be used to flag posts and remove them either by AI or a real person
__label__Position	changing the electoral system
__label__Evidence	I agree with you about the level of crime and the economy and also the state of the environment. In some respects the economy could be linked to levels of crime as people are experiencing issues with day to day expenses and this could be inpacting the level of crime especially petty crime 
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is not absolute and people can have opinions but if those opinions insight violence and urge people to brake the law in anyway those opinions should not be allowed to be on any platform. https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/human-rights-scrutiny/public-sector-guidance-sheets/right-freedom-opinion-and-expression
__label__Position	Hate speech can be reduced on newspaper websites through monitoring from that platform. By coding derogatory words or terms so that they are automatically flagged this would be a fairly quick manner for websites to check that comments aren't spewing hateful rhetoric.
__label__Position	Hate speech on an online platform would be harmful and should not be tolerated. People are affected by these harmful words and it does not create a good environment. This article explains why hate speech is so dangerous. https://impakter.com/hurt-feelings-real-danger-hate-speech/
__label__Evidence	It can be fooled by the writing of the bad word, like in some social media.
__label__Evidence	I agree, they had alot of time to get things right but have failed to do it, it is almost like they don't want it anymore
__label__Evidence	then you are just living in an echo chamber with no opposing views
__label__Evidence	Yes, and moderators ensure that comments stick to this
__label__Position	Unfortunately, hate speech isn't illegal and despite parliament trying to pass a law on this, it is difficult to balance freedom of speech and the right to be protected from hate crime. (https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime) However, because of this I think it is extremely important to moderate these comment sections, muting certain words and phrases to make sure that there is a balance of free speech without allowing people to needlessly offend certain people or groups.
__label__Evidence	In my opinion, yes, its normal to say what you are thinking as long as you dont harm anyone in any way sow yes silencing its needed.
__label__Evidence	Do you have any ways in which you would reform the justice system? i do agree that this is something that definitely needs to be looked at. 
__label__Position	I still do not know whether to vote or not. 
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately wages increase and every small business has to raise its prices to compensate. There is no help for them so its a hamster wheel and prices will keep going up 
__label__Position	comments need to be monitored and able to be reported by other readers
__label__Position	Moderation of both users and comments isn't difficult to implement and will weed out the idiots that want to ruin it.
__label__Position	What have the Conservatives done about the appalling state of our rivers? Absolutely nothin!!!!
__label__Evidence	so moderators and filters are needed
__label__Position	By not providing comment section not unless the article need their opinion. There'll be a note notifying readers to be well mannered.
__label__Evidence	Yes -  utilisation of private healthcare is the only logical way to cut waiting times. 
__label__Evidence	I think everyone should be allowed a point of view. It needs to be done in a way that people still feel as though they have a voice.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites, the website providers could set up a system that requires readers who want to comment to give their full name. On top of that, the website provider can ban hate speech and hateful comments.
__label__Position	Economy, immigration, public services
__label__Evidence	But if people´s right to speek is crossing the border towards hatered speech then you are disregarding another´s right of respect
__label__Position	By blocking the use of certain words that mean comments could be made but not hateful ones. you could also only read articles if you are logged in to an account and if you write nasty comments your account gets deleted.
__label__Evidence	There is no way to restrict speech without censorship...so remove the option to comment rather than to censor.
__label__Position	The Conservatives are an absolute joke, but not a very funny one!
__label__Position	We need to let people have their opinions spoken. Removing the comment space is not a good option. Instead, we need to better educate people on what's good and what's bad.
__label__Position	By educating people that not everything written in newspapers is true, they should egnore some information
__label__Position	Improving the economy and NHS, ending Tory corruption and waste, defeating the far right.
__label__Evidence	private healthare is for profit, not for the benefit of the masses. Look at the mess private healthcare is in in the USA
__label__Evidence	i don't agree with this - you should be able to give an opinion if it is valid and relevant.
__label__Evidence	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.
__label__Position	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__Position	Healthcare 
__label__Position	I think that automatic tools like filters are a good idea but too prone to error. Harmless words might accidentally be filtered out and those using hate speech are usually wise to this and learn how to manipulate their words or spelling to bypass filters. A moderation policy implemented by a human moderator still seems like the best response to me.
__label__Evidence	Always a question of who guards the guardians
__label__Position	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__Position	lower taxes
__label__Position	I think everyone raised some good points already, but overall, it seems to be that some moderation is required no matter what, and that might be too costly for some smaller platforms to implement.
__label__Evidence	flagging comments would be an easier way
__label__Evidence	If comments are present they should not be regulated. People should not allow themselves to be personally offended by the opinions of others. People have a right to their own beliefs and opinions.
__label__Evidence	Agreed, something needs to be done about this. It's hard to get into the housing market these days, even finding a proper rental can be hard.
__label__Position	one thing that should be used is there are some subjects that just attract hateful comments,some wise use of not allowing any comments to an article should be used ?
__label__Evidence	I actually really like this idea - it deals well with the issue of removing hate speech as nothing just gets automatically published and checked later. Yes it will cut down on the amount of comments overall but even that isn't a bad thing, if only the most coherent, high-quality comments are published.
__label__Position	banning words is an useful idea but in addition, moderators are key for public newspapers websites. they are able to moderate what goes on and get rid of hate speech whilst still providing a platform for those that have honest but respectful opinions.
__label__Position	HAVE RULES ON WHAT CAN BE POSTED AND HAVE SOMONE CHECKING FOR NASTY COMMENTS . IN THAT WAY PEOPLE CAN EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS WITHOUT HATE SPEECH. AND PEOPLE CAN BE TOLD OR GIVEN WARNINGS TO HAVE THEIR COMMENTS REMOVED IF THEY DO NOT FOLLOW THE RULES. IT WILL ALSO HELP TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE MODERATOR TO CHECK THE CONTENT.THERE SHOULD ALSO BE WARNINGS OF BLOCKING THOSE WHO GIVE SUCH SPEECHES.
__label__Evidence	no more hate speech
__label__Evidence	too many racists in the country  
__label__Position	A more fundamental question might be, should we allow for comments on online newspaper articles at all? Is that the right place or forum for a proper discussion of the issues? The news cycle has become more instant, with a constant impulse to be first to report and for people to interact. Is this how news should be disseminated?
__label__Position	Whilst it is not beholden on newspapers to provide a comment space, doing so can help to introduce moderating behaviour to a topic, as well as unfortunately introducing hate speech into a space. Provided comments are well moderated for harm (and moderators are fully supported to provide this service with robust mental health support) I think it can be useful to have a commentary space. Comments should be heavily moderated for any form of harm however and abusive users quickly banned.
__label__Position	No, I believe it would mute/cancel the freedom-of-speech spirit that should be contained within journalism.
__label__Position	Better real-time monitoring of posts, either by AI or human monitoring (or combination of both). Another way is to reuire ID to sign up so as each comment is linked to someone who can be identified. This would surely reduce the instances of hate speech, and help catch those who take part in such hate speech.
__label__Position	I think action needs to be taken no matter what. Leaving a comment section open without any measures to combat hate speech is not a viable option. Based on this article, if left unchecked it can lead to real world violence, https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/
__label__Position	All discussions on forums should be monitored. Key words must be identified related to hate speech and trigger an IT system to remove the post. Writers must be warned (written warnings) must be sent, after for example 2 warnings they will be banned from the website for a certain time. If hate speech is extreme and could bring potential harm, a report at authorities must be brought on.
__label__Position	With reference to AndreasS comment, monitoring the posts will provide censorship. Hate speech can be reduced but it can be successful with the considerations made in the debate. https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20how%20you%20can%20help%20combat%20hate%20speech,hate%20about%20the%20worst%20instances%20you%20see.%20
__label__Position	I think that no comment section is generally an improvement over a completely unmoderated comment section, for any online site/community over a certain size. However, comment sections can add value to a article and extend the discussion beyond it. One option is to employ moderators to actively remove hate-speech and other problematic content, but if this is unfeasible then self-moderation of comment sections can sometimes work well (e.g. Reddit, with up/downvotes). The latter seems to be dependent on the community though, and can lead to echo chambers developing.
__label__Position	by censoring certain key words that can reflect hate speech
__label__Position	there is a study on this and a recommendation on an algorithm to detect hate speech. i believe there are already various algorithms out there that do this.  Link: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006
__label__Evidence	Absolutely right, we are in the hands of corporate business man. But we can change this situation by changing our lifestlyes.
__label__Position	""" We should focus on quick wins while getting things organized with the industry properly"" (Crispin Edwards)"
__label__Position	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech by stating clear rules and explanation around what hate speech means and then stating the consequences for breaking these rules.
__label__Position	Hate speech on newspaper websites can be reduced by checking for swear words or any vulgar language that maybe present in the comment but it should not be disabled because people have freedom of speech and cancelling the comment section will not only affect those who make bad comments but also those who give insights and engage positively with the content
__label__Evidence	I feel that in this case, by getting rid of hate speech, I feel that it is worth sacrificing a part of free speech in order to make everyone feel comfortable.
__label__Evidence	this is a reason we need a change, our NHS needs help but which party will keep their promises?
__label__Position	automatically delete hateful comments
__label__Position	There is a lack of engagment with readers when newspapers close their comments.
__label__Position	I think a simple moderation system should be sufficient to make sure hate speech is filtered out without suppressing readers' comments. It should probably be a real person wherever possible, however, to be able to appreciate the nuance of individual situations and to identify the way hate speech is often couched in hidden language which bots won't catch (Nazis using certain numbers or punctuation marks to mean racist things for example).
__label__Evidence	Free speech should only be allowed if it doesn't infringe someone else's right, like hate speech does.
__label__Evidence	Even if it is getting harder we have to at least try.
__label__Evidence	making individuals aware
__label__Position	Climate Change is the greatest threat to humanity - ever. No party seems to be taking this seriously (The Greens laughably are  against nuclear power which is the only feasible way to keep our current standard of living while cutting carbon). Labour and Lib Dems do at least address some parts of climate change in their manifesto. I will likely be voting for one of them.
__label__Position	Against removinh space for readers comment section
__label__Position	Cost of living, energy crisis, NHS waiting times
__label__Position	A position that has surprised me on this platform is people thinking commenting should be turned off. This is not fair and if a newspaper website wants to have a posts free from hate speech they should moderate them.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers are not supposed to be one-sided in the first place; they're supposed to give all the information, which will include different viewpoints by nature to avoid bias. This seems like a slippery-slope to accepting journalists' opinions as fact.
__label__Evidence	Climate Change is the main issue  It causes a lot damage to our environment  Thanks to some of the volunteers who are helping to fix the issue by sharing the issues in mass media to cover up a lot of people
__label__Position	How they intend to treat savings
__label__Evidence	yes which is worrying 
__label__Evidence	Although I agree with these, addressing these issues isn't going to be easy for any government, no matter what they make you believe before voting day.  Fuel prices are global and they can't really increase taxes much more as it'll bomb the economy.  The so called tax reducing tories have raised them more than anybody. 
__label__Evidence	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers. The only purpose they serve is announcing your views to everyone else reading the same article. It's unnecessary and people's opinions are rarely changed by what they read in the comments section from some random reader/commenter.
__label__Evidence	Disagree, there are ways to reduce hate speech, but they need to be implemented correctly.
__label__Evidence	Rejoining the EU won't happen - its done - focus on making sure if works for the country properly 
__label__Evidence	This is a great read on the pros of a law
__label__Evidence	Yes cost of living is high but it has happened before and will happen again. Bailing people out is costly as well.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech will not be resiticted if we monitor hate speech. there has to be a line drawn, and this is the line.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely true. Everyone has freedom of speech. We live in a democratic country where everyone have the right to speak and all voices need to be heard. It is up to the individual to make sure that they put forward their points without being too aggressive and not getting carried away.
__label__Position	Focus communication efforts on the middle ground rather than extreme positions
__label__Evidence	We have so many vacancies in low-paid jobs which are usually taken an immigrant workforce. Loads in NHS and agriculture
__label__Position	Undoing Brexit
__label__Evidence	great idea
__label__Position	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__Position	There is no one answer. it must be a multitude of approaches. It is every organisations responsibility to regulate its platforms.
__label__Position	Having a 'pre-filter' of mods go through every single comment would be ineffective, since it wouldn't allow for a fresh and continuous discussion. Niether is it a good day to delete the comments altogether, since humans are social and need the interaction with  others to develope. I am still for online filters and a competent team of mods, that can react to reported posts.
__label__Position	I incline to the opinion that it is almost impossible to elimate hate speech from such comment sections without elaborate checking systems and that these are not worth the trouble. There I think the best solution is to remove the comment sections altogether. What useful purpose do they actually serve? None I would suggest. I doubt if the newspaper editors or journalists pay much heed to the views expressed therein and I'm sure that politicians and powers that be don't.
__label__Evidence	It all seemed to get swept under the carpet.  The number of people that died in this country due to covid was disgraceful and the government should have paid for how they behaved
__label__Position	Scotland had a referendum
__label__Position	that is part of my desire, to see the NHS looked after
__label__Position	Newspapers should have a system in place for allowing hate speech comments to be reported so that they can be removed, and constantly monitoring comments to see which ones have hate speech might be problematic and if there are many hate speech comments, then it may be appropriate to temporarily remove the comment section and or ban the users of the hate speech comments.
__label__Evidence	Straight out of the WEF. No thanks.
__label__Evidence	It can help break down ideological bubbles and foster understanding
__label__Position	tax, distribution of the funds
__label__Position	block the person who always use hate speech
__label__Evidence	Removing any form of comments or place for discussion may reduce hate speech, but also prevents discussion, leading to one sided arguments
__label__Evidence	totally agree , weve had a selfish government for too long
__label__Position	The genocide in Gaza, selling weapons to Israel ,The nhs , the economy, cost of living crisis
__label__Evidence	This would work well with non-bias moderators
__label__Position	https://www.prio.org/publications/12392   According to Katrine Fangen and Carina Riborg, people who wrote hate speech comments on the newspapers were people who thought themselves as knowladgeable, so they will go on promoting hatred and spreading their ideas even if we eliminate the section of comments: we have to work on the root of the problem, which is education.
__label__Evidence	This is definitely a major concern. For the first time children are going to be worse off than their parents
__label__Evidence	Labour haven't said anything in Scotland about stopping SNP? 
__label__Evidence	It has a significant impact on all aspects of life
__label__Position	I think that comments at least need to be vetted so that when someone gives an opinion that is valid it can be posted but invalid, aggressive, nonsensical comments get filtered out.

__label__Evidence	Moderation to reduce hate speech, objectively will be beneficial
__label__Evidence	There are just so many options.
__label__Evidence	the numbers coming from the boats has increased and yet the govt telling us more are on the way if there is a change of govt. are they all not in the same parliament knowing all things? 
__label__Position	removing the comment section is not a solution to addressing hate speech. The important is not censored viewer comments but to censored hate speech. there are a few options to consider to address this: 1. only registered viewers can make comments. personal information such as identification information that can be used to directly identify the individual commenting. this will reduce hate speech for fear of being exposed in real life and possibly charged with a criminal offense. 2. comments that come through should be filtered through a platform before being posted. 3. addressing hate speech through education is also another option. however, this assumes that people making such comments are not aware of the comments that they make.  https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380290
__label__Evidence	What will take place tomorrow will be theatre. The problem is the system as a whole. The real power lies with the banks and financial institutions. Whichever party is in government they are subservant to these financial powers. We need a new financial system which is not a debt based fiat system.  
__label__Position	By having technology that can detect hate speech so that it can be blocked before it is posted.
__label__Evidence	Perfect
__label__Evidence	yes very important, they won't be weak when dealing wth Trump or Putin
__label__Position	Investment in infrastructure
__label__Position	If the comment section has hate comments, then the newspaper must cancel the comment section
__label__Evidence	I disagree, I think there is no difference on both platforms.

__label__Position	In general I believe the comment section should only be available if people are ready to share their identity. This would minimize the hateful comments. On top of that, it is important to educate people on the topic and the consequences of hate speech. Furthermore, the comment section could be edited by the provider so that hate speech that targets specific people or minorities could be cut off.
__label__Position	I wish we could vote for policies rather than parties
__label__Evidence	these are very important issues that need seeing to urgently
__label__Evidence	This still leaves comment sections open to abuse and may embolden other readers to pile onto the hate speech comments with hateful comments of their own.
__label__Position	I think removing comments might not be the best approach as I find important for people to be able to express their opinion. The best approach would be to moderate comments and invest in AI to automatically be able to identify or flag comments possibly linked to hate speech.
__label__Position	The comment section must be cut off
__label__Position	Bring in a wealth tax to decrease inequality in the country
__label__Evidence	who is in charge of moderating the conversation and who decides what is permitted to be discussed? Moderating conversation is a very dangerous precedent
__label__Evidence	I second this!
__label__Evidence	This reduces free speech and lets the negative win
__label__Position	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__Position	"I'd say yes...I""m not entirely clear if anyone reads comments and it elicts a change in opinion on any subject...degernerates into name calling."
__label__Evidence	I totally agree. Freedom of speech is very important, but if it goes too far and it becomes online harassment, then it's time to treat it as a criminal offence.
__label__Evidence	No offence but no one is stopping anyone from being proud of their heritage. I'm British and I've never felt like I have to say sorry for everything either. 
__label__Position	removing comment sections on newspapers to avoid hate speech will never benefit anyone and will not solve the issue but it might help applying algorithm that will track words and sense tone from messages typed in by individuals. If the algorithm sense vulgar or hateful tone than must not allow the message to be posted.
__label__Position	Use bottom-up citizen engagement approaches
__label__Evidence	they have messed with the NHS and given their friends positions and contracts just to benefit themselves in other ways  
__label__Position	Fixing the cost of living crisis; political reforms to make the system cleaner, fairer, and more democratic; combating climate change; defending minority rights
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	There needs to be some space to discuss the news to encourage conversation and fact checking.
__label__Position	i am surprised by people who think the hate comments must be allowed as they show freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	I feel this really limits free speech. Speech should be free as long as it's not harmful. Not all comments are mean/come from bad intentions. Without having additional comments, there wouldn't be a richness of opinion in the news.
__label__Evidence	Education only goes so far - some people will just ignore this policy. Perhaps just removing hate speech manually, or having a review process so only non-hate speech comments are published may be better.
__label__Evidence	Honest
__label__Evidence	I think DominicJ is onto something however with technology being on our finger tips and Artificial intelligence making things easier i think having a software that can be able to restrict those criteria can be a good thing and will be automated
__label__Evidence	agreed, the media hypes up levels of immigration. 
__label__Position	To enable and inspire colleagues. Leadership happens at all levels, not just senior team  
__label__Evidence	As we know the demand exists, I'd suggest part of the solution might be to become / beget the supply organisations for the delivery of the work. That then creates a need to train workers.   Otherwise traders might be trained but find work elsewhere.   Are Oxford Direct Services in a position to tackle this? As a limited company but owned by the City Council, they seem well placed to be provided with the means to scale up operations locally? 
__label__Evidence	I agree with Dominic , who becomes judge of what is true, what is without bias, what is hateful versus what is simply disagree, disapprove, dislike. Do we say happy things only and simply create artifical safe spaces where only positive ego boosting comments are allowed?
__label__Evidence	I do think that Covid hugely affected the NHS and this would be difficult for the government to fix overnight (in addition to the funding crisis). 
__label__Evidence	but how do you reduce hate speech
__label__Evidence	In the other hand, gold like any other commodity (e.g. oil, gas, metals) experience great fluctuations in price in times of political uncertainty. 
__label__Position	Peer moderation - where users can upvote and downvote comments and can also report them if they feel as though the post is inappropriate or offensive.  I do not believe that comments should be approved before posting and I think that having a team of paid moderators is both expensive and liable to accusations of the moderating being biased.
__label__Position	p.s. Vote Reform
__label__Evidence	This is a fair point -- maybe removing the influence of comment sections altogether will stop the trend of news increasingly becoming 'comment' and being less objective in reporting. If people want to exercise their free speech about the article's content, they can still share the article and express their opinions on it elsewhere, like on their personal social media channels.
__label__Evidence	By total scrapping of the comment section, reporters might get away with misinforming the public therefore they need to be called out right on the spot but in a respectful manner.
__label__Position	I am deeply concerned that none of the main parties have said anything about how they intend to stop the illegal immigrant boats landing daily on our beaches
__label__Position	cost of living crisis
__label__Evidence	Algorithms dont always get it right
__label__Evidence	I agree, wish people could have got behind Corbyn and not fallen for the smear campaign
__label__Evidence	I disagree because it is still tolerating that intolerant people express themselves and make their opinions visible. Even if they are removed,it will take a while for that to happen and this hateful message may have already found an echo in another bigot.
__label__Position	The planet has its long, long history and doesn't need man at all. How are we sure that climate change is damaging to the planet and not just man?
__label__Evidence	Agree, the NHS needs to be restructured 
__label__Evidence	Definitely discussions should be moderated - so much extra info and nuance comes from reading the comments below an article, but not is the comments section turns into a free-for-all
__label__Position	The policies and how they will be enacted.
__label__Position	I am frightened about the plans that the WEF, WHO etc have for the world so I have voted for a party which does not agree with the plans.
__label__Evidence	Discrimination may divide readers
__label__Evidence	re-education will not help some people
__label__Position	hate speech online will always be there and we shouldn't focus on hate speech a lo because there will be a lot of positive comments
__label__Evidence	But too many people in the UK are on benefits and dont want to work in these minimum jobs as they are better off sitting at home. What training is needed that they dont learn on-the-job?  
__label__Position	Long term strategic leadership rather than the short term chaos of the past few years
__label__Position	Placing blame and/or trying to figure out who's at fault is pointless. It doesn't matter if it's the corporations, individuals, or natural processes--the problem exists, whatever the cause. And it has to be addressed, even if it's expensive, even if it's monumental, even if it seems impossible to solve--because without working toward a solution, our planet and ourselves will cease to exist.
__label__Position	It seems like the only option is intervention on the newspapers part. If they don't want it to be the wild west, they'll have to put measures in place to control the rhetoric. There are many options like moderators, auto-mods or bots, required account registration, and removal of comments and users who violate the rules. Ultimately there are many options with costs associated with them, it's up to the newspapers to decide what is best for their platforms.
__label__Evidence	It should really be up to newspapers, but better no comment section than an unmoderated one
__label__Evidence	cost of living in a big city will always be high no matter where you are in the world. Simple case fo supply and demand 
__label__Position	I agree that a moderator would be too costly. I think the blocking of key words would be the best way forward. I also do think that if you were to read a paper article you would just discuss your views with your friends so I don't really see the need for a comments section.
__label__Position	The economy (cost of living), NHS, social issues, the climate
__label__Position	the cost of living crisis is my main concern, closely followed by nursey costs and free child places 
__label__Evidence	yes. the website can simply have words that are not accepted in the comments. this can minimize or eliminate hate speech altogether
__label__Evidence	it would make sure that very offensive comments could be either moderated or removed
__label__Evidence	Re-education sounds quite dystopian.
__label__Position	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__Position	No I think is not
__label__Evidence	I think people still have the right to comment on an article and give their opinion. It would be wrong to not permit this.
__label__Evidence	Yes... reducing of hate speech is not
__label__Evidence	Very true! Once a party is elected half the promises go out the window! 
__label__Evidence	I agree I work in conveyancing and it doesn't help first time buyers at all
__label__Position	In such a technolgical advanced world, we are not going to get rid of these comment sections that are on online newspaper articles. They provide a place were people can discuss their opinions and have debates. However, there is a minority of people who use those spaces to preach hate speech and this is an ongoing and increasing issue.
__label__Evidence	"I feel newspapers don't work well and an interactive medium anyway. ""letters to the editor"" might be an avenue"
__label__Position	More moderators would be the simplest strategy for reducing hate speech but there will still be a period of time where the hate speech is live on the website before being taken down. Using report buttons on newspaper websites can help the moderator identify the hate speech faster.
__label__Evidence	Who are The Rich in your view? And who are the poor?
__label__Evidence	Training is essential for the Moderators. Moderator will support monitoring.
__label__Position	AI technology could be used to override the possible bias that there might be if the moderators are human. It would follow an unbiased algorithm. https://www.smartmoderation.com/how-to-give-your-readers-the-comment-sections-they-want
__label__Position	But what about those who were going to give positive comments. I believe comments should just be monitored
__label__Evidence	This would help the content management team not have to answer every mail about comments.
__label__Position	Considering the arguments and evidence provided by everyone in this discussion, I believe we should somehow find a way to allow people to discuss their opinions (and avoid restricting free speech for the most part), while also protecting people from the potential harms to themselves directly and to and by society by supervising and moderating discussions.
__label__Position	On the other hand, people have the right to not receive unnecessary hate on the internet by trolls. https://www.journalofcommunication.ro/index.php/journalofcommunication/article/view/322 this study shows that hate speech online has a negative effect on lgbt people. People shouldn't be subjected to discrimination for their sexual orientation or race ect. Maybe censor words that offend protected classes? women, lgbt, minorities ect.
__label__Evidence	We should all think before we comment freedom of speech does come with responsibilities
__label__Position	that i vote for neither Tory, Labour, Lib Dem or Greens. i detest them all and their desire to interfere in my life 
__label__Evidence	Users who want to comment will find other ways of doing so such as via facebook or other social media channels. Free speech needs to be permitted otherwise a balance is not provided.
__label__Position	I think comments should be limited and all negative comments should be blocked
__label__Evidence	People can have constructive debates and confront serious issues without using hate speech. Filtering hate speech will not stop debates.
__label__Evidence	Allowing the readers to push a post out of air by flagging it could be just as easily abused by people to mass flag posts they dont like for political or personal reasons and create more problems than it solves
__label__Evidence	Sadly many businesses just don't care and are all about making $$$$ and abusing the environment over helping take care of the current ecological crisis
__label__Evidence	agree public all the way only the rich got richer massive corruption
__label__Position	I believe a new software should be made that becomes an extension to an app that will block the hate speech
__label__Evidence	I like to see comments with people who think like me
__label__Evidence	Social media companies are already using AI to do this and news platform should approach it in the same way - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/
__label__Position	Fact Checking may be a better solution than moderation that censors posters of fake news or hate speech. Research shows that censorship can serve to cement the posters conspiracy views (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X19301159). A 'fact checked' type flag could be helpful instead.
__label__Evidence	this is a great way to monitor
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	finding alternatives to taxing us to death.  Investment and Nationalisation. Instead of private sector becoming millionaire, let's get stome profits so that they can be used instead of working people paying for everyitngn
__label__Position	I think it is important to reduce hate speech. However, it is equally important to uphold the right to freedom of speech and to encourage healthy discussion as this is how people learn/grow. Thus, as another user commented I think there should be dedicated people who monitor the comment section and ban/limit the offending commenters.
__label__Position	Defence is important because if our country is under threat, none of the other issues will matter.
__label__Evidence	If we don't ask corporations to step in and get involved, then we're ignoring the biggest contributor of this issue - EVERYBODY needs to be involved.
__label__Position	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__Evidence	The NHS and social care, together with the dire poverty in what is supposed to be a first-world country, are priority issues which should be dealt with immediately. Climate change will take much longer to address, but we can make a start now - but cannot expect solutions within one parliamentary term.
__label__Position	immigration, wokery, left wing bias, 
__label__Position	I like the idea from AndreasS that comments could only be made ny individuals that have a subscription with the newspaper. If there was hate speech they can then be held accountable.
__label__Evidence	Implementation is challenging due to private land ownership
__label__Evidence	Social media can be used productively and is not inherently harmful
__label__Evidence	Algorithms and AI are much more advanced than the common person thinks. AI is able to discern intent. It is not solely based on keywords like a primitive AI from 30 years ago.
__label__Position	Websites can use filter options as mentioned here in this article, https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/filter-hate-speech-hoaxes-violent-clips-out-of-social-media-a6432199534/
__label__Position	wanting a secure future
__label__Evidence	Moderation can be seen as restricting free speech.
__label__Position	The Newspaper websites should create an AI software so it can be able to detect negative responses and should be flagged as red flag and then disable those comments from being posted to the public. I think that would help instead of someone reading through the comments one by one which would take time to do.
__label__Evidence	I don't want responsibility 
__label__Position	labour will bankrupt the country again
__label__Evidence	While I agree, there are a lot of things that have to happen first before this can become a reality. We have to rework gas stations around the country so that they have the charging stations necessary for electric vehicles and we have to build the charging stations near highways and thoroughfares for those same electric cars so that the future infrastructure is ready to handle the influx of electric cars before demanding they be manufactured at such a high rate. 
__label__Evidence	this is a lovely thought but not sure it will ever happen 
__label__Evidence	anyone could have a problem with another persons point of view
__label__Position	Maybe we just cant and only filter what we can catch. Maybe if the world could move into a zone where they just ignoe hate speech. Perhaps it is rreported and just deleted with minimal fuss. Haters hate being ignored.
__label__Evidence	Polarization is necessary, without it newspapers would be able to deliver any information to the public uncontested.
__label__Evidence	This statement was inspired and taken from Secretary General (https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/hate-speech-is-not-free-speech-says-secretary-general-ahead-of-human-rights-day)
__label__Evidence	I agree and as stated in this article (https://www.impactplus.com/blog/no-comment-why-companies-continue-to-move-away-from-comment-sections-on-their-website) it is possible to see that some websites actually already deleted the comment sections. They turned out to be quite useless as mostly trolls were commenting, while no interesting discussions were there anymore.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__Evidence	Really, or are you trolling?
__label__Evidence	You are creating a divide between the news and how people interpret it
__label__Evidence	Given time that is almost a certainty
__label__Position	Have moderators who constantly monitor and remove hateful posts or ones that are inciting others/goading others.
__label__Evidence	IF you are choosing to have more than two children why should the government fund that? You should be making choices based on your own situation.
__label__Position	"While I understand people's points on censorship and freedom of speech, I do wonder to what extent do we allow ""freedom of speech."" Is someone else's freedom to feel safe, secure, etc. not worth as much as someone's freedom of speech? These are the types of arguments that hate speech brings up, and I would encourage you all to reflect on that as well."
__label__Position	I think having counter speech is something that could be of concern, as this would lead to arguments. Creating a platform particularly for that wouldn't be so good as people would go there to argue.
__label__Evidence	writers will not know how the reader feels
__label__Position	Having read some opinions I believe maybe the best way is for everybody to be ID Verified, I do have some concerns however as this will make it difficult for those who can not afford ID to contribute and a solution for that would need solving first in my opinion.
__label__Evidence	it would give focus to the journalism.
__label__Position	Create a European deliberation platform/organization to support and validate deliberative processes
__label__Position	not all stories need people to add their opinions sothat should ease the pressure on moderators
__label__Position	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__Position	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__Evidence	Not necessarily. I think opinions are okay but not when it is hate and discrimination. Thinking morally that is wrong and shouldn't be allowed on any type of platform.
__label__Evidence	I didnt have a problem reading them
__label__Position	Comment spaces should be moderated, perhaps even approved before posting.
__label__Position	Newspaper comments and letters pages in particular are a good place for national conversations
__label__Evidence	you know what they say - no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in
__label__Evidence	The cost of living is diabolical but I don't think that any of the parties will correct it. I agree that Scotland should be allowed to have another vote on independence.
__label__Position	We need moderation by a group of individuals with valid reasoning
__label__Evidence	We can only do the best we can with the technology we have right now.
__label__Evidence	While I agree that we're all entitled to an opinion, I think it's important we understand the difference between hateful comments that are for hurtful purposes rather than an opinion that does not generate more hate
__label__Evidence	It seems that massive industrial scale projects are what caused climate change. Large scale industry is a major cause of pollution.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	I dont mind this but we cant ignore the fact that there are company who are spreading so much pollution and greenhouse effect just for profit. We need to reprimand them as well.
__label__Evidence	me too with cost of living 
__label__Position	I think we can have proactive crowd voting or send to moderator functions, to ensure a timely removal items could be hidden if several votes are received over time.
__label__Position	renationalise rail, water and energy
__label__Position	According to this article, self-regulation is considered to be an effective tool for filtering hate speech on newspaper websites with moderations https://zdjp.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/poyhtari.pdf
__label__Evidence	100% agreed, has this would work has everyone needs to learn how to respect others
__label__Evidence	more teachers needed

__label__Position	Comments should be monitored before they are published
__label__Position	I agree that public comment sections should be moderated
__label__Position	if the supporting party has any ideas for improvements and no false promises, along with this if they are in support of gaza or any sort of ceasefire
__label__Evidence	However, it might also discourage people from leaving comments generally as it is quite difficult to leave a response and not many people would go through that much effort to say something, which there is a risk of being personally identified as well.

So the news then is we have overcome inequality. And then there is this, uh, explanation. Is that correct? This is what you think? What you are describing in the."",Person21 "
__label__Evidence	Yep. First step is to get rid of the Tories.
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites by having an initial screening of certain questions to determine if a potential commenter is prejudice in any way. As previously mentioned an algorhytim or computer could determine what is positively answered or negatively answered, and the positive participants would be allowed in the sites where the negative people would not have access to.

__label__Position	Online users will now be aware that their negative online behavior will have consequences, and this feature will allow healthy online conversations to take place without any arguments.
__label__Position	redistributing wealth needs some help and thoughtful thinking
__label__Evidence	The negative aspect would be how moderators are going to decide whetehr it is a hate crime or not. Manupliating the moderators could be an issue.

__label__Evidence	true that 
__label__Evidence	this is censorship
__label__Position	We cannot! As simply as that
__label__Evidence	This is true but with the way the news is setup, giving your own idea can lead to heated arguments which can lead to hate speech
__label__Position	maybe make the comment section questions and answers about the article so comments are stictley moderated
__label__Position	Using a tool to search for hate speech would help to eliminate such comments and would not prevent readers from commenting on topics.
__label__Position	comments containing hate speech should be deleted
__label__Position	"To achieve diversity in tackling environmental issues we need to be ready to accept that a fair environmental policy would CANNOT MEAN treating anyone in the same way.

__label__Position	Short answer is you can't, as the term 'hate speech' is incredibly vague, and can differ from person to person.
__label__Evidence	This is a good way to monitor comments
__label__Position	Poor argument
__label__Evidence	Speech cannot be violence in and of itself. What you are suggesting closes down public forums and debate, enhancing the impact of closed minded thinking and echo chambers in our society.

__label__Position	NHS is an important issue
__label__Evidence	True. At the end of the day, the publisher controls what is published
__label__Position	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers by their nature are polarised entities. Banning comments to diminish polarised opinions makes little sense if the newspapers themselves are pumping out polarised opinions.
__label__Position	People should be allowed to say what they want, you cannot say something nice about anyone all the time
__label__Evidence	I think you are right to some degree Fabio. However wouldn't moderating some of the comments mean that we don't get an overall view of people's real views on a topic? Even if they are hateful?
__label__Position	This software has stopped working for me
__label__Evidence	yes. if their going to make money from individuals, they should also suffer the consequence of creating a safe space for them.
__label__Position	By blocking people who have already put hateful comments on the newspaper's website before.
__label__Position	Some people can just delete someone's comment not necessarily it is a hate speech, but because they do not like the person.
__label__Evidence	Agreed, and already planned in our hpuse, where we'd usually vote Lib Dem, but will be voting labour as they are more likely to defeat the tories, although I suspect that in this constituency that this will be a futile attempt.

__label__Position	Hate speech in the comment section is a real problem which leads to real world consequences such as mass shootings as noted here in this article by the un https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech
__label__Position	I believe that mandatory mask-wearing policies infringe upon personal liberty, and that mask mandates are politicized and are manipulative tactics by certain politicians and special interest groups as ways to increase state control
__label__Evidence	If a moderator removes a comment then they should have to justify why to the contributor who may be upset at their comment being removed.
__label__Position	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__Evidence	Agree, in terms of cost, is an extremely -therefore not sustainable- expensive lifestyle. Only applicable to western societies 
__label__Evidence	Removing them removes those concerns and creates a more positive website experience for the reader
__label__Evidence	We need rules and governance as a society. We don't always have to say what we think especially when it constitutes hate speech. You can argue respectfully.
__label__Evidence	it feels right
__label__Evidence	There is no place for hate speech in today's society for hate speech. It is harmful and in some cases, illegal.

__label__Position	Jennifer P, I agree
__label__Position	We are privileged to live in a society with free speech, it is important to keep it this way. Providing a voting system within a comment section allows for free speech to continue and the most relevant comments to remain at the top.
__label__Evidence	I've heard this idea of safe routes for migrants. Britain is an island so literally the only way to get here is by boat.
__label__Evidence	one persons free speech is another persons hate speech
__label__Position	Bringing a solution based on advanced machine learning which could automatically detect hate speech and disable comment function only for articles leading to commenters using hate speech.
__label__Position	news papper sites should filter comments and cancel posts that most promote hate speech
__label__Evidence	newspapers are owned and have people to answer to financially, they are also driven by clicks and advertising revenue so you could be blinded without understanding feedback on a topic from the public
__label__Position	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech can also be reduced by having a like or dislike option on the each comment. This would show how people like or dislike a certain comment. Just like how YouTube has a like or dislike option, the same should be done for the newspapers website
__label__Evidence	Climate Change is the main issue  It causes a lot damage to our environment  Thanks to some of the volunteers who are helping to fix the issue by sharing the issues in mass media to cover up a lot of people 
__label__Evidence	You may think that, but you can't deny that the global community does, which is why the UK needs to do more, other than just idly standing by. And read the rest of the views people are putting here, the whole point of this exercise is asking us for simplistic arguments. Read a book if you want more nuance 
__label__Evidence	look into all that gas cars require before you are so quick to promote them.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Climate change, the economy, NHS, prisons, education and how we fund it all
__label__Evidence	arguably the issue that affects the most  
__label__Evidence	Modern life has moved on from my world view in this regard; I probably shouldn't be taken as any kind of sensible benchmark.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech does not equal hate speech. “Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.” Source: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	Mental health support for yong adults
__label__Evidence	This won't catch everything
__label__Evidence	Choosing an unsustainable diet, e.g. meat-eating, is not only affecting you but also the whole planet that we live in. The principle of freedom cited there, applies up to the point it violates other's freedoms.
__label__Position	I agree with this  and think more education is needed.
__label__Evidence	no to part privatisation a) slippery slope; and b) widens the care disparities between income groups -- privitisation is only attractive in areas where it will make money, i.e., high income/high density
__label__Position	Moderation is the key to this argument, people like to talk and to share opinions, the newspapers readability might suffer if this is removed. there should be an algortithm censoring speech before it is posted and there should be an option to dispute if a statement is hate speech or not, which should then be reviewed by humans. Also it is very important to distinguish between hate speech and diferent opinions. Censorship should not equal an avenue to bully people.
__label__Position	cost of living, nhs
__label__Evidence	i believe that people know what is wrong and what is right. they do know when their comments are harmful

__label__Position	"""If too expensive to adapt people wont do so, resulting in buildings in disrepair, and thus environmemtal and heritage loss"" (Anna Beckett)"
__label__Position	noo it will limit freedom of speech. But there should be a little censorship
__label__Evidence	I agree with this definitely. Let people comment but keep an eye on what people are doing by introducing moderators.
__label__Position	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.
__label__Position	United Nations website has some useful information regarding hate speech (https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage). I think a lot of this boils down to educating people and understanding how these issues can be tackled.
__label__Evidence	this is true opinion is important
__label__Evidence	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.
__label__Evidence	I agree,brexit has been the disaster I expected
__label__Position	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.

__label__Position	Honesty of politicians, NHS, Cost of living. 
__label__Evidence	stand up to the french and send them back
__label__Evidence	it really is for the vast number of people struggling. 
__label__Position	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__Evidence	Everyone has a right to say but it should be put across correctly
__label__Position	Knowledge on the subject should also be accessible and should be provided thorough multiple channels to reach our key audiences. I really enjoyed listening to IHBC @COP26 podcasts (see link) https://ihbc.org.uk/podcasts/
__label__Evidence	hate speech is a real problem and enabling it to freely exist on the internet can lead to a variety of issues including mental health problems for the person its directed at.
__label__Position	Develop new technological tools to enable better democratic participation
__label__Position	Countries need not to spend much for this. It must initiate some compulsory programs and stop producing vehicles that depends on petrol etc
__label__Evidence	Citizens may not have enough knowledge to make informed decisions
__label__Evidence	I think it is the responsibility of the websites to moderate any hatefull comments. You can agree and disagree with somthing without hate.
__label__Position	i think a law should be made that if you do not delete hate speech from your website or article than that newspaper will have to pay a fine.
__label__Position	immigration, cost of living, woke politics
__label__Position	Newspapers should not remove the comment section. They should rather require users who would like to comment to have a registered account with a paid subscription. Rules protecting other users should be set and failure to follow them will result in a suspension of the subscription of those who are guilty and the forfeiture of any funds.
__label__Position	It reduces hate comments on the specific platform but I dont think it reduces hate speech. It deviates the problem somwhere else.
__label__Position	Is anybody disgusted with the restricted choice of parties we have to vote for..I personally don't really want to vote for any of these clowns
__label__Evidence	fingers crossed for change
__label__Position	There are plenty of other platforms for people to comment on the news, this can be done while keeping the author or the items subject private. Therefore, less effected, sometimes people talk/type before thinking about the ramifications.
__label__Evidence	https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/15/20806384/social-media-hate-speech-bias-black-african-american-facebook-twitter Agreed.  Some research suggests algorithms can be biased.
__label__Position	Maybe introduce somesort of advanced AI to filter and flag anything along those lines
__label__Evidence	Voting for a smaller party is a protest vote. Not voting just gives the 2 main parties less competition 
__label__Position	Comments should be monitored
__label__Position	I think it should have rules when commenting in a online newspaper and also should have option to report comments that doesn't follow the rules
__label__Evidence	There's good and bad in all of them and unfortunately the bad in them is what makes us reject so quickly!
__label__Position	I agree that it will get harder every year to address climate change. The worse it gets, the more of a challenge it will be to address it.
__label__Evidence	it glitched out so i didnt get to finish what i was typing, but clearly 14 years of the tories have run the country into the ground not to mention everything being sold off to foreign countries for a quick buck. tories would sell their own family to the saudis or qatar for a few quid
__label__Position	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__Position	I agree that moderators would be a good way to look at individual comments as the would likely be more effective than a computer program. If the public could also flag offensive comments this would go a long way to helping the moderators to look at potential offensive comments
__label__Evidence	This would eliminate inappropriate comments
__label__Position	People have different opinions on different news topics and may not see their hate comment to be something bad while others may. A comment section is made available for everyone to share their opinions. Although sometimes the hate comments are taken out of hand so aa AI moderator should be made available to filter out the hate comments that get out of hand.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites can have an option where other people could report the hate speech comment.
__label__Evidence	That is a very minimalistic view as there could be many words that get missed and what happens if someone uses normal words that make a hateful sentence
__label__Position	We cannot adopt but we should adopt to it because there is no other go with the affected environment unless helping the environment  less pollution 
__label__Position	Remove anonymity. Perhaps contributors should be required to join sites giving some checkable background information. This can be helpful if there is a brief CV so that one can see the perspective of the contributor. There shouldn't be any need to reduce space for comments, just the need for moderation. In the UK we are used to the idea of newspapers having political preferences, so when approaching a discussion site one might have an idea of its political identity and preference.
__label__Position	It will only take away a platform for people to post hate speech but it will still exist. perhaps keeping comments might allow open discussion which may impact other peoples thinking and reduce hate speech through debate and education
__label__Evidence	agree, the news could start selling fake information if the comment section would be removed
__label__Position	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments. If a certain post contain such words, it should not be automatically exposed to other readers but should be reviewed first by the admin to check if it meets the standard before being exposed to everyone.
__label__Evidence	By eliminating readers comments, the readers will not be allowed to give their opinion on the topic, which infringes free-speech.
__label__Position	Moderation of the comments section
__label__Evidence	It also promotes cyberbullying ,saying it is a free speech.
__label__Evidence	everyone has the right to be heard
__label__Evidence	agree with this! Lack of education is often the biggest culprits when it comes to hate speech - many people are scared of things they don't know about.
__label__Position	I don't think either party will make any difference. they are all the same
__label__Evidence	people are going to feel like their views are supressed
__label__Position	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__Evidence	Removing comment sections on newspapers, enables limited misinformation and discrimination to reproduce.
__label__Position	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__Evidence	Yes I'm sure there is software that can do that.

__label__Position	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so              Dominicis wrong
__label__Evidence	internet is not a devil, people are
__label__Evidence	i think so too, there must be software to instyruct an algorhythm to pick out certain hate words and delete the comment
__label__Position	I think the idea of the government rewarding people who participate in activities to protect the environment is a very good idea. It would encourage people to do that more.

__label__Position	Everyone has very different lived experiences. Comment sections should be a place for open and fair discussion. We just need people to oversee these conversation to make sure hate speech is not present and everyone gets a fair say.
__label__Position	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__Evidence	"Doing nothing because of a fear that doing something will be ineffective, means simply that nothing will definitely be achieved.  Freedom of speech is definitely curtailed if people who are likely to be attacked are themselves, afraid to speak.  The experience of CreepyPMs in keeping their site open, friendly and inclusive, using 30 moderators for a relatively small site and a tough policy where in essence that comments must be conductive to a supportive environment and if not, can be removed, even if they have not violated a specific rule, seems to potentially curtail freedom of speech and could silence valid criticism but can also ""allow marginalised and targeted individuals who are not likely to share their stories or opinions when the door is left open to the rest of the world"" to speak.  https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation"

__label__Position	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__Position	by having a system or word check that will not allow users to use words that are considered as hate speech
__label__Evidence	This will enable people to discuss freely

__label__Evidence	This article summarises it well  https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__Position	It already happens on platforms like YouTube and Instagram so it's definitely possible for article sites.
__label__Position	Instead of removing the comment section newspapers can try and look up new and different ways to facilitate their reader engagement.
__label__Evidence	"Transparency and inclusivity in debates build trust and engagement among citizens. BASED ON:""Just so we have, uh, it on a, on a regulatory basis, that we have, um, clear that there is no law making without the possibility of, um, commenting on it or whatever."",Person23 "
__label__Position	No, everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this statement. Updates can also be installed to reduce the number of inappropriate comments
__label__Position	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__Evidence	Focusing on shared goals helps identify common ground
__label__Evidence	"""Community cohesion and impact on wider community heritage is key"" (Paul Norman)"
__label__Position	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Labour are awful but the other options are pretty dire too
__label__Evidence	farage is not the most honest! 
__label__Position	There are various articles and booklets on the internet, freely available, giving recommendations as to how online sites and mdia sites can reduce hate speech. This one says the following ''Social media companies and other internet intermediaries have a legal and ethical responsibility to take effective measures to reduce the dissemination of prohibited hate speech on their digital platforms and to address its consequences. This includes, where appropriate, content moderation''  It seems they are suggesting that all sites that allow public comment should preferably engage moderators to sift out extreme and obscene comments. I think, really, this is the best that can be done without curtailing free speech. Link jere to recomeedations https://www.idi.org.il/media/13570/recommendations-for-reducing-online-hate-speech.pdf
__label__Evidence	While it looks fair to request readers to create accounts and enter their personal details before being able to comment, the reality is, data breaches are still very common. Expecting newspapers to keep readers data secure might not be realistic when such large and technologically advanced companies as Optus can become victims of hackers. Consequences of having personal customer data stolen can be severe. https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/23/optus-data-breach-customers-yet-to-be-reimbursed-for-passport-replacements
__label__Position	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__Position	noo it will limit freedom of speech. But there should be a little censorship  
__label__Position	I think the big thing here is moderation. Either with AI or real people. AI can be used superficially to remove comments that include profanity or slurs. Furthermore, having any comment go through moderation with a real team before posting can fairly reduce hate speech.
__label__Position	Lack of resources to create a more elaborate filtering system is a factor that can impact the process
__label__Evidence	This is what most social media companies already do.  Often the AI sensors the conversation based on the pre-selected criteria without the intervention of any human moderator, because there is too much traffic for humans to monitor.  This leads to a reduction in free-speech.

__label__Position	Use software to filter out offesive words.
__label__Evidence	there can be nuanced discussion that will be lost if certain words or terms are automatically disallowed. People will find a way around as soon as things are banned
__label__Position	monitoring behaviour is always neccasary - but there needs to some sort of enforment too. some sort of 3 strikes and youre out.
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately, newspapers are not always entirely neutral so perhaps they should sign up to some sort of independent moderation
__label__Position	Letting individuals know that as soon as someone comments, that is no longer confidential and if it is hate speech they shall be reported to authorities
__label__Position	everyone should be entitled to comment and have opinions but the comment section should be checked and hate comments deleted and that user blocked on the website
__label__Position	As the comments are read by human beings, their opinion and/or bias come into play when the comments are posted.  This can therefore bring ambiguity to the comments posted depending upon who is reading/approving them.

__label__Evidence	Bigger than that; 1/3 of existing dwellings are of traditional (solid wall/naroow cavity) construction, and 75% of building work is to existing dwellings. This is not a niche. In this we differ substantially from most EU countries. BUT comfort doesn't necessarily equate to higher temperature, it's more about relative humidity and temperature differentials between people and surfaces. 
__label__Evidence	the comments section lets you know what sort of paper you are reading, if its full of loonies then youre probably in the wrong place!
__label__Position	By educating the masses on the psychological of hate speech on others
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	In my opinion, completely removing the ability to comment is a win for the people using hate speech. The problem should be tackled in another way. Machine learning/AI/bots are getting better and more accurate each year, so using one of those to pre-screen comments and in addition using human moderators to decide the not so clear cases is far more optimal choice in my opinion, as it wont reduce the freedom of speech and opinion, as it should be in democratic world.
__label__Evidence	We're going to need to think about this long term as birth rates have fallen.  There won't be enough working age people to support the pensioners.  Immigration is one solution.  If you don't want that then what would you do? 
__label__Evidence	this then gives them the attention they crave and publicises what they are saying
__label__Evidence	Who would not agree!
__label__Position	I additionally feel that I live in an area that is overlooked by potential MPs, just focussing on the main town in our constituency and actually doing nothing for us
__label__Position	Being and advocate of freeing people from hate speech or reducing the verbal abuse that happens on the internet is not necessarily advocating against freedom of speech. As much as there should be freedom of speech people should also be free from abuse. The safety of people should be a priority.  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-020-03737-6
__label__Evidence	I completely agree with this and this might also allow journalist to engage with their readers. I found this study to be really interesting about how the majority of journalists that were interviewed found values in comments.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech undermines people
__label__Position	Many companies are relying on AI tools to track down and remove hate speech. https://respondology.com is one of the tools that can be used by newspaper websites to reduce hate speech.
__label__Evidence	there wont be a planet earth if we dont act now
__label__Position	voting for someone who instils confidence that they can lead this country in what  it needs
__label__Evidence	Agree and they have nothing to show for it
__label__Position	Citizens should be consulted in the agenda-setting of the policy cycle, to make sure concerns and hopes are taken into account and reflected in the policy actions.   Citizens should be also actively engaged in the policy-making cycle, in particular for Policy formulation and Policy Consultation  
__label__Position	I think that if you still want people to be able to comment their opinions you won't be able to stop hate speech. The only practical way to reduce it would be to have someone monitoring the comments or have someone approving whether comments go public.
__label__Position	By making sure that contributors/writers remove any hate or negative speech if it violates the guidlines set.
__label__Evidence	I definitely agree with this view point. Its important to have free speech when addressed correctly
__label__Position	NHS!!!!!!, the economy, first time buyers, cost of living crisis
__label__Evidence	it might have a negative effect on other people, sometimes it might even be harmful
__label__Position	not as much as labour will spend
__label__Evidence	"""The issue of consistency is a HUGE one. As a sector, we do our best but the Public Sector should focus on things such as the skill gap for instance"" (Chris Jofeh, Consultant to Arup and Chair of the independent Decarbonisation of Homes in Wales Advisory Group) "
__label__Evidence	You are right -People have lost the ability to debate, and think that shouting the loudest wins the argument.
__label__Position	Pledge to support NHS, pledge to support workers and workers rights, pledge not to raise taxes
__label__Evidence	Disagree. I think that newspapers have always been allowed to 'sell' information, but news sites do so at their own risk by eliminating vast swaths of subscribers and advertisers. A good reliable newspaper is also the best long term business model
__label__Evidence	Debate is important
__label__Evidence	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.
__label__Evidence	Someone has had to code that algorithm so it is already bias. Comments need a team of diverse moderators
__label__Position	You can learn from others in the forum
__label__Position	by removing our ability for freedom of speech means that governments will be able to control the information in the public domain.  I believe this is something that will never change nor be won.
__label__Position	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__Position	Head speech acan also have a very negative impact on people mental health too. the newspapers can make people look really bad and not write the correct information. we all remember how much the media contributed to Caroline Flack.  Im NHS staff, all the stuff that was said about us during COVID. most was ok but you look at papers now and read comments about us now, than 2yrs ago when we were heros. its so depressing
__label__Evidence	The current system of voting does have its issues. But there is still value in voting. 
__label__Evidence	"It's not about how much people are earning... it""s about how much living cost... You can earn 1Euro and hour if the housing costs, food etc compares to that wage.  You can earn 13euros per hour if the nursery cost is exactly the same per month than what you earn... or that you can't phisically be alone, without a partner and have your own accommodation as simply almost impossible to pay.  Just because other countries have it worst, it doesnt mean the situation here is not bad. "
__label__Evidence	The problem is that people can register an account giving false details, so how do we ensure they have given their correct age for example?
__label__Evidence	I disagree with this. Previous to social media and comment sections, newspapers often printed responses from readers. Journalists and those giving opinion pieces should face scrutiny and feedback from readers.
__label__Evidence	We shouldn t pretend that science has all the answers - there s still a role for politics
__label__Evidence	In the same way that society needs to fight hate, the Internet needs to fight online hate.
__label__Position	IM NOT SURE WHO WE CAN TRUST TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY ANYMORE. JUST FEELS LIKE WE ARE ON OUR KNEES.
__label__Position	I do not think reader comments should be suppressed however those which express hate speech should perhaps be partially redacted or clearly marked as offensive / likely to cause upset. I'm unsure how this could best be achieved, as I agree with the point made that using an algorithm could unfairly quash some legitimate political points, alongside the suppression of opinion by over-zealous editors who could suppress those opinions which fall outwith their own spectrum.
__label__Position	Tax and spend
__label__Evidence	This is silly, AI is always built with the bias of its creators
__label__Position	Using tool, that automaticully remove discussions where is wrong kind words
__label__Position	There are a few strategies for equitably lowering hate speech on newspaper websites without removing room for reader comments. One approach would be to have a group of moderators who are in charge of approving or denying comments prior to posting them.
__label__Position	cost of living
__label__Position	The UK is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world
__label__Evidence	Stronger action could damage EU-Israel relations
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	There is a spread of policies that come under the heading of population control ranging from the coercive to the persuasive.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this statement. When we didn't have any computers, people didn't have the luxury to comment instantly.
__label__Evidence	I do not think this is fair on the people who genuinely want to have a fair conversation on the subject.
__label__Position	I support Labour but find starmer creepy
__label__Position	cost of living crisis, the NHS, the northern powerhouse etc
__label__Position	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__Position	The economy, defence, education, the environment, who would be a strong leader
__label__Evidence	Brexit was the biggest piece of self harm any country has done in years. we need to trade with the EU and now we have to obey their rules without any say. madness.
__label__Position	the only thing i like re labour is recognising palestine but not enough to vote for them
__label__Evidence	I agree, cancelling opinions is reducing free speech, but there needs to be a bar to which all comments are moderated and allowed/prohibited.
__label__Evidence	Would make people think before posting
__label__Evidence	Surely it is possible to have a free exchange of ideas without resorting to hate speech. There must be a  level of basic human respect that can be maintained.
__label__Evidence	So many big problems to solve.  The place is in a state!
__label__Position	The debate can be seen in the discussion here: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2020.1837638
__label__Position	There needs to be a fine balance between freedom of expression and stopping hate speech. The best way is for comments to be screened as that would still allow opinions to be shared while ensuring the safety of all readers
__label__Position	Housing
__label__Evidence	cost of living and energy bills
__label__Evidence	No contribution to the general debate.
__label__Evidence	i think these ideas would be the way forward and i agree
__label__Position	This isnt a freedom of speech issue. That only related to public, not private entities. A private company can prevent you from voicing your opinion on their platform for any reason. i think hate speech is probably the best reason a private company can give in this respect. https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does
__label__Evidence	Do you get a notification if I reply?
__label__Evidence	I definitely agree with this. The website itself should take some responsibility as to what appears on the site. Offensive behaviour should not be permitted.
__label__Evidence	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.
__label__Position	Intermediaries will agree on interoperability standards for consensus platforms.
__label__Position	 a proper solution is that by having a vote system the comments can be deleted by reaching to a specific point.
__label__Evidence	I believe both teachers, Parents and religious leaders as well as the government has to re-sensitize young people about how they ought to live.  
__label__Evidence	"I absolutely agree with that position. As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that. Also - hate speech is not illegal in most countries. Quote from Wikipedia: ""While ""hate speech"" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment."" Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States"
__label__Position	sorry i dont know what happened my window closed :(
__label__Position	https://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/no-turning-of-news24-comments-is-not-a-form-of-censorship/
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Position	The active reporting of hate speech and the website being accountable for curating said reports
__label__Position	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__Evidence	Agree, this problem needs to be sorted, it can not violate human rights
__label__Evidence	in many cases expressing freedom of speech leads to the excessive use of hate behavior towards those who think differently, which can have repercussions on the concept of freedom itself: there must be moderation, but it must not be biased
__label__Evidence	This could be a good approach. Education is important
__label__Position	Freedom of speech can also make people take advantage of false data and spread rumours.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this sentiment as people will be more conscious of their opinions.
__label__Position	I have been listening to the parties take on the NHS crisis and the cost of living.  The NHS is going to be th emajor reason of my choice of who to vote for.
__label__Position	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments
__label__Position	We need tough laws, which punish offenders, but with the state of the prisons, namby pamby judges, the criminal fraternity can almost act with impunity, as we are far too undermanned in the police.
__label__Evidence	Agreed - in some situations, people choose not to work as they would be financially worse off. That needs changing.
__label__Evidence	"""Decarbonisation as much about people as about brick and mortar"" (Paul Norman)"
__label__Position	I'm pro taking action. It doesn't have to be a big action, but if we all play our parts, we can make even small changes to help offset the situation. 
__label__Evidence	It looks like trash all over the country, neither Conservative or the New Labour care at all, they both have to go.
__label__Evidence	Not to be rude, but I doubt people who post hateful comments would care. Imagine someone telling a bully that they're rude - I don't think this would change anything in their behaviour.
__label__Evidence	Because pretending as if it's not happening doesnt mean it will stop when there is a disable comment.
__label__Position	I think criticism is valid when discussing topics and it allows people to express their honest opinions. However, everyone should be mindful about how powerful their words are and to articulate their opinions an appropriate manner.
__label__Position	"""The scale of the heritage buildings problem is big, 125.000 buildings in 169 local authorities are managed by the Clarion Housing Group. The problem is not only about climate and heritage but most importantly about people"" Paul Norman"
__label__Evidence	Newspapers should be neutral, but you find that they are often the ones who actually instigate hate speech
__label__Evidence	How will it be worse than what is already happening?
__label__Position	NHS, Climate Change, Public Transport
__label__Evidence	Scientists have been saying this many years now, it seems people just want to ignore the problems and hope it will go away on its own!
__label__Position	By banning certain words/phrases that may be viewed as rude/discriminatory/classified as hate speech. Removing the opportunity for comment completely would take away free speech and open discussion
__label__Position	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__Evidence	a lot of people, especially the older generation, rely on newspapers in order to be exposed to current affairs
__label__Evidence	Agreed. No allowing the public to share their views only allows the publication to share information without being challenged and I don't think that's fair.  There should at least be room for engagement and debate by the public.
__label__Position	lets just have a completely open space for discussion and everybody is informed of this before entering the comment section.
__label__Position	And any response that limits speech needs to be very carefully weighed to ensure that this remains wholly exceptional, and that legitimate robust debate is not curtailed. refer to this website for more information https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000233231
__label__Evidence	"""if costs of repair of heritage building becomes to high then the chances of these building to end in misreparis is very high"" (Anna Beckett, Symmetrys)"
__label__Position	No, everyone has freedom of speech, citizen opinions should be heard just as journalists are.
__label__Evidence	can algorithms be trusted
__label__Position	Hate speech should not be entertained, if newspaper website fail to moderate their readers comment section, it is best to close the comment sections
__label__Position	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__Position	Deliberative democracy will focus on co-creating new ideas with broad citizen engagement. 
__label__Evidence	Labour will change the UK into Venezuela
__label__Evidence	Must tax the richer for sure. 
__label__Evidence	I agree-having recently been in hospital, I was shocked and saddened by the state of the NHS
__label__Position	I do not see the value in the users comments and rarely read them. People often seem to post unverified rubbish presented as fact. I compare to a printed newspaper, where the only right to reply is by means of letters to the editor.
__label__Position	Everyone want to know about the climate change increase due to Manmade cause.So first we want start to reduce the waste level in our home.It leads to changes in the society if else we will face the huge climate changes in coming decades. 
__label__Evidence	we definitely need a change but hopefully for the better
__label__Position	How are the parties going to deal with the state of the NHS.
__label__Evidence	People are on waiting lists for too long 
__label__Evidence	There should be a right to free speech and peoples views
__label__Position	Student loans are another big issue. We are saddling our children with debt as Universities are entering a financial crisis of tgheir own
__label__Position	Create an independent Judicial Council to handle judicial appointments
__label__Evidence	The dangers of allowing free speech has been constantly seen in different moments. A recent time was when Donald Trump Instigated riots in America, causing damage to buildings and applauding it... making it worse and worse
__label__Position	I am not sure if what i am typing is being recorded...
__label__Evidence	higher probably if they're scrounging on prolific all day... 
__label__Position	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__Evidence	can be subjective what someone views as hate speech someone else might not agree
__label__Position	It is too easy for people to use the term 'free speech' and how it is a fundamental right, when really they are using it to excuse 'hate speech' which should never be tolerated. There are other ways that people can share their ideas in a respectful way.
__label__Evidence	I'm not sure I trust any of the party leaders to deal with any issues. They all promise so much but deliver little 
__label__Position	Taxes, NHS, Crime, Immigration
__label__Evidence	You should vote for yourself 
__label__Position	Giving Scotland a voice in Westminster. Cost of living, trident. Brext, and a return to the EU.
__label__Evidence	"likely to commit hate crimes"""
__label__Evidence	Then who is the judge and jury to decide what is right and what is wrong?
__label__Position	Everybody should be allowed to have their own opinion but at the same time they need to be respectful of others and be aware that not everybody has the same views.
__label__Position	Affordable Housing
__label__Evidence	Trying to convince those with extreme views often leads to unproductive arguments that reinforce divisions
__label__Evidence	It will create faster moderation of content
__label__Evidence	"""Environmental Product Declarations - from natural resource to building site - allows professionals to choose lowest carbon products"" (Peter Cox) "
__label__Position	I think we are all too quick to jump ship. We don't give people in power a chance to change things for the better. This doesn't happen overnight; it takes a long time. The key thing for me is stability and long term growth in all sectors.
__label__Evidence	not everyone has the same education or principles
__label__Position	I cannot modify your statement to clarify it  
__label__Position	There should be moderators of the discussion, people who use hate speech should be informed of what is problematic about their comments, comments should be deleted or they might be hidden but you can open them and read the moderators comments. If educating is not helping after first attempt, person should be restrcited form further discussion.
__label__Evidence	Then what happens to those who cannot afford to buy new vehicles and what about all the oil producing companies and businesses that will be ruined?
__label__Evidence	They can already do this, take a look at social media policy and they can, but choose not to in fear of going against freedome of speech.
__label__Position	Maybe LDs and some newly elected Labour MPs will push the govt further on green issues
__label__Position	What is the point in voting when the politicians all do what they want after they win the election
__label__Position	Time for a change and getting rid of the tory chaos and scandals
__label__Position	I think that homes should be either made cheaper, or a program to help young persons get homes easier is in order and that the NHS needs more support
__label__Evidence	I completely agree, everyone should have the chance to give an opinion and also agree or disagree with the points in an article, however there is no room for hate speech.  The best way to achieve an ability to comment on online newspaper articles and websites is to allow free speech but to regulate comments so as to avoid nasty hate speech, people then making such hateful comments could then be blocked from further comments.
__label__Position	General taxing... We need to raise the base rate which will help put money in pockets to pay for these rise in bills.  Taxing big companies like Shell and Amazon will surely help claw some money back too
__label__Position	Whose responsibility do you think it is? Unfortunately hate speech will continue unless there is someone to control it
__label__Evidence	Education to try and find the root causes as to why the specific hate speech is rooted in some peoples minds
__label__Position	in theory YES, but hardly anyone really wants to be affected, we all still want our holidays abroad, cars, heating, non-seasonal food, and of course tomorrow, not in several weeks time
__label__Position	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	difficult to control but an important question is, by banning hate speech are we missing the opportunity to change minds? https://www.npr.org/2019/10/10/768894901/how-twitter-helped-change-the-mind-of-a-westboro-baptist-church-member
__label__Position	No ways, I think it should be monitored. This technology is so advance now, i think it will be able to detect hate speech and alert the head of the newspaper and they should be responsible for removing it. Some people practice hate speech because they are one sided and comment sections sometimes helps them be enlightened.
__label__Evidence	Yes I feel there are all these grand promises but very little info on how they will be funded 
__label__Evidence	I think we really should all use our vote, even if it's in a tactical way to remove a particular candidate or party. There's lots of information around to help - just make sure your sources are trustworthy
__label__Evidence	Will allow for more focus on what really matters.
__label__Position	attaching more serious sanctions for people who use harmful/hateful speech.
__label__Evidence	its hard to find moderators without bias
__label__Evidence	very true, people get too worked up online and post things they would never say IRL.
__label__Position	I think all the hate speech my be removed before it is published on public
__label__Position	Trust in delivery of manifestos
__label__Position	This can be done by assigning moderators to read comments and filter out those that classify as hate speech.
__label__Position	A good way of reducing hate speech on websites of newspapers is to program the AI so that it adheres to the laws of the country that the website belongs to. For example in the UK the AI that moderates comments could use the CPS (https://www.cps.gov.uk/crime-info/hate-crime) definition of hate crime to control the comments.
__label__Position	https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__Position	We need to focus on shared goals and common ground rather than divisive issues
__label__Position	A reporting site that is accessible across all platforms would be a good start like https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime.
__label__Position	I think we all need to gather our communities and apply pressure on policy makers to address these issues with urgency 
__label__Evidence	Coundn't agree more!
__label__Evidence	is achievable
__label__Evidence	I have always voted the same and won't change just because other parties offer pretty ideas 
__label__Evidence	I agree, but we need to find ways to make citizens active and responsible. We should find hooks to make them interested in participating and being actively engaed 
__label__Position	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__Evidence	Who decides what is categorised as Hate Speech?
__label__Evidence	there is always a need for opinions
__label__Evidence	I believe if almost everyone who knows about hate speech will know what to say  and what not to say.
__label__Evidence	Could you elaborate?
__label__Evidence	Yep, it needs to be a holistic approach. People have a right to speech but they need to be educated in how to express them kindly.
__label__Evidence	If I had the choice I would vote for none of the above because I don't think any of them can be honest or decent if they tried
__label__Position	I won't be voting so none
__label__Position	Having a heavy hand in removing hate speech could backfire and reinforce certain readers'  skewed worldviews. A study published on Science Direct (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X19301159) says that censorship of online comments can confirm commenters' conspiratorial views. Hate speech can lead to real life violence, but you have to go about moderation carefully.
__label__Position	“Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.” — United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, May 2019 This is in line with my opinion related to this topic. Escalation is the real problem that could cause serious problems, such as hate crimes.
__label__Position	While I fully appreciate the urgency of curtailing hate speech, I am strongly of the view that the space comment should not be eliminated because of a few bad apples. Rather an algorithm that can monitor and flag down hateful comments in real time could be used and thus positive and constructive contributions would continue to trickle in. Besides, merely shutting down the space comment results in cancel culture which is a step back in our dispensation.
__label__Evidence	My concern is that comments could be flagged as inappropriate in bad faith e.g. to shut down the opinions of those people disagree with even if the comments are not inappropriate or hateful
__label__Evidence	agree, reduce waiting times especially for A&E 
__label__Evidence	Who is the supervisor?
__label__Evidence	agreed, but what kinda corruption?
__label__Evidence	We should stay of it all - its horrible yes but focus on the UK 
__label__Evidence	I agree, people need to review comments
__label__Position	This conversation seems to be pointless as our opinions will probably never be heard by those who are in control and authority and by big government who controls the people. They are the ones that need to hear and listen to the  people through forums and discussions
__label__Evidence	The comment space allows positive ideas to filter through
__label__Evidence	How can we draw the fine line between hate speech and freedom of speech?
__label__Position	Maybe. But all humanity should collectively act together with the lead of the big super powers. If USA and China stay out, I am afraid it would be useless
__label__Position	I think if a site changed from being able to comment to not being able to comment such as my Facebook feed, then I'd be very upset and possibly boycott the website like everyone else would. However, I also have Apple news where I just read the news and can't comment, but I'm perfectly fine with this. People want a voice, if it's hateful, other people will know. The question for me becomes if Facebook removes commenting from news posts, is that a good thing. No.
__label__Evidence	there is not enough being done towards climate change
__label__Position	wanting the Conservatives out
__label__Position	Migration and public spending are important
__label__Evidence	maybe fake news will be reduced in this way
__label__Position	We need a better country for our children.
__label__Evidence	"Why? It doesn't seem to have brought us any of the supposed benefits. Unless you think going back to the 70s and creating more red tape for businesses is a ""benefit""."
__label__Evidence	I agree with this point of view - a lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with
__label__Evidence	It allows racist  views to be challenged
__label__Position	One way to reduce this could be to remove comments and block those who have been leaving these messages.  I am not sure who easy this would be as you can create a new account in seconds probably.  And if this is someone who is intent on causing controversy I am sure they will find a way around a block.  Are you able to get something for platforms that can do this?
__label__Evidence	I'm worried for my children's future regarding housing.  How can they afford it when it's 9x an average salary
__label__Evidence	I agree, there should be a policy on what is considered hate speech therefore making easy to censor hate speech
__label__Evidence	I agree with this as the comment section will be filled with hate speech that could be upsetting for some
__label__Evidence	i dont think brexit is that bad considering the two year pandemic which certainly left a bigger issue on the country as a whole and brexit was voted by democracy the majority wanted brexit 
__label__Position	Yes I agree with this!
__label__Position	This is something that I think is impossible to do. One can never ever be sure  of people s intensions. I don't believe newspaper websites should even have space for readers comments , there are other platforms where readers can express themselves
__label__Evidence	Blimey, a chance? 14 years not a long enough chance?
__label__Position	"I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about ""A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments"" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm"
__label__Evidence	People will need to get trained to identify hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I think moderation is key, so do agree!
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech and thought are both really important and allow people to sometimes 'clear' their minds of thoughts.
__label__Position	we really hope in this election
__label__Evidence	I strongly agree with your point due to people posting negative comments and can also lead to cyberbullying in a way. I feel like policies need to be in place to ensure that people who misuse the online newspaper website face certain consequences and the people who have access to the comment section also their accounts needs to be properly register for tracing.
__label__Position	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__Evidence	Which environment benefits do you mean?
__label__Evidence	well reform dont have over 50% in the polls and blame the conservatives execution of it not the voters 
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.
__label__Position	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.
__label__Evidence	Makes a more friendly and respectful environment
__label__Position	Significant work has been already on this issue
__label__Evidence	I agree that anybody being allowed to comment can give rise to fake news in comment sections
__label__Position	Investments in the uk roads and railway 
__label__Evidence	It does take away freedom of speech on the website
__label__Evidence	posting hate is not freedom of speech
__label__Position	Comment sections should be removed altogether in order to reduce hate speech and harm especially to vulnerable communities.
__label__Evidence	Allows people to be able to comment on current events while eliminating the issues of hate speech
__label__Evidence	Yes, it is a very difficult balance and trying to find mechanisms that are fair and balanced to control these are basically impossible to find.
__label__Evidence	unfortunately, people may continue to not adhere with the proper language of communication under comments.
__label__Evidence	the thing is people always find a way to say those certain words.
__label__Position	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__Position	"Removing or limiting ones ability to comment or express their thoughts and opinions brings into question ""freedom of speech"". However freedom of speech should not be prioritised over the wellbeing of other people in terms of cyber bullying and discrimination. And for that reason in order to prevent serious hate speech considered derogatory or that puts groups of people in a vulnerable position, what we are able to say on social media should be regulated."
__label__Evidence	Agreed. I found a similar article and the more people feel censored the more hate sites thrive. Instead of a platform where people can engage and educate.
__label__Position	I think that the best way to reduce hate speech in newspapers' websites is to have a robust and consistent moderation policy. It might delay the posting of comments but at least that way no one can use the space negatively.
__label__Evidence	I have never supported one particular party, I only voted for who I think the best (or least worst!) person is each time
__label__Position	It is unnecessary to have censorship of comment sections. Let everyone see the bigots, the haters and yes, people with a different view of the world. It wont hurt to see  that some people live totally different lives. That IS what reading is all about you know, living lives other than our own.
__label__Position	what they're aims are about climate change and Palestine
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is interestingly tackled in this article
__label__Evidence	While this would eliminate all hate speech, newspapers would not implement it, as the interaction drives hits on their site, so the comments section is an essential part of spreading the news person to person
__label__Evidence	"It's important not to confuse freedom of speech and hate speech: ""freedom"" can be a dangerous weapon when you use it to attack others for their identity."
__label__Position	Numbers on benefits too many cut the money paid to them 
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	The cost of living and housing crisis in my area
__label__Position	I remain unconvinced that comments sections do more good than harm. According to https://socialmediapsychology.eu/2016/10/05/onlineandsocialmediacomments/, comments encourage extremism and there is a large (22%) amount of abusive language. Discourse should take place, but not anonymously in online comments sections
__label__Evidence	Yes indeed - crime - tax avoidance by big corporation and alot of other issues face us at the moment
__label__Position	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__Evidence	this is good idea but some words can have more than one meaning and be used it variety of different sentences. so maybe muting words that could be discrimatory could have its limitations. i.e if you mut the word gay ( this word then count be used it postive topics about gay rights marriages etc .
__label__Evidence	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts!
__label__Position	Nowadays everything is possible on the internet. The comment sections must exist and limit the bad language. There are so many options and software the moderators can use. There is very good explanation about the profanity filters in the following article: https://www.spectrumlabsai.com/profanity-filters   There is also VPN filters and so on, the computer systems offer so many options for everyone. We should not just give up and remove something that can exist with the right IT.
__label__Position	If the hate speech needs to be looked at, then it should go back to editor of the paper and question why are they agreeing to this.
__label__Evidence	yes it is a key issue
__label__Position	This is very true, but then isn't it time to start before it gets to be a worse situation? The economic impacts are starting to hit now.
__label__Position	key issues for me would be somebody who looks after the average joe, makes my food cheaper makes my car insurance less redu
__label__Evidence	No need to keep on - just do the process properly - were out its done 
__label__Position	To proofread comments and remove all hate speech before it is published.
__label__Position	I believe that people should be taught that casting a vote is only a small part of their political participation. Very often the gap between policymakers and citizens comes from the fact that the delegation mechanism does not provide true incentive for elected lawmakers to listen to the people. On the other hand, most of the people believe that they have done their job once they casted their votes, ignoring the legitimate channels to influence the government and policies.
__label__Position	According to the UN website, the solution to hate speech is not reducing free speech, but rather increasing it. This allows conversation and exchange of ideas, so people can see other people's point of view and develop empathy. This has been proven to reduce hate speech overall
__label__Evidence	It is Europe's moral duty to do so
__label__Evidence	You may find Labour a lot worse. Especially if you work. They'll take all your money off you.
__label__Evidence	it is censorship
__label__Position	Removing hate speech from comment section should be a must as there should not be any room for hate speech in our society. My original thought was that commenters should not be allowed to remain anonymous and that any hate speech by them should have real life consequences. Having had this original thought I am now inclined to say that commenters should be allowed to remain anonymous an example behind my thoughts are that in some countries it is illegal to be gay and those who are, are persecuted. If for example they wanted to post on an article or give an opinion on an LGBTQ issue then they could be identified. There are more reason to remain anonymous, found here https://www.techiexpert.com/reasons-why-people-seek-anonymity-on-the-internet/
__label__Position	Moderation and regulation needs to be performed by both the newspaper itself and the platform. To my understanding this is performed currently through Facebook, though as some other comments allude to, is done mostly by bots with no human review (leaving this open to incorrect interpretation). Blanket comment bans would remove the ability for open and healthy discussion, but some moderation is necessary to combat bullying and other prejudicial stances expressed online.
__label__Position	It would be very difficult to achieve without removing the ability to comment (which, in my opinion , isn't t he best solution). That's the nature of internet anonymity.
__label__Position	eliminating the comment space on the internet would not only reduce hate speech, it would also remove the positive comments so i don't think this is a good idea at all. Regulation would encourage discussion whilst allowing people to express strong opinions without resorting to hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Also shows that his aides have no clue either... Surely if you are a housing officer then you know your field and how to tackle it! 
__label__Evidence	this may clash with the need to preserve heritage buildings.
__label__Position	Biased due to AI == The creators could manipulate AI to for Their Voices
__label__Evidence	There is an urgent need to engage with the high consumers, and that therefore focusing on poorer and excluded communities, the so called ‘hard to reach’ may not deliver the highest possible level of cuts in carbon emissions for every pound expended
__label__Evidence	the issue of bias becomes an issue in determining what or what not to remove.
__label__Evidence	If you disagree with how they run their websites, run your own website.
__label__Position	There is a fine line between hate speech and honest criticism one should not be confused with the other and the person filtering such comments should be biased
__label__Position	The boats
__label__Position	You would need to detect which accounts are using hate speech and ban them from writing posts
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately people will always exist that are hateful
__label__Evidence	I agree, Scotland voted to remain anyway and as usual don't get what we vote for 
__label__Position	https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joseph-Graf/publication/354727319_The_prevalence_of_comment_sections_in_US_daily_newspapers/links/6149e947a3df59440ba12b3a/The-prevalence-of-comment-sections-in-US-daily-newspapers.pdf
__label__Evidence	are we listening?
__label__Evidence	Continuing as normal.
__label__Evidence	I agree that most if not all online news articles do not need a comments section. However, I believe having a note to tell readers to be well mannered would not stop readers from posting hate speech if they had intended to do so in the first place.
__label__Evidence	when hate speech encourages violence or discrimination against any specific class of people it should be removed regardless of how inoffensive an particular individual might find it
__label__Position	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__Evidence	newspapers are meant to inform, not to be discussed. The comment section is not necessary.
__label__Position	yes we can if its in sighting direct violence however we have to agree on what the limit is then on this freedom of speech, equally we need to restrict it to just give people in power a position to censor too. its a tough one. If people could handle bad comments it wouldnt matter
__label__Position	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments. Pre- using technology to recognise potentially offensive words as well as closer moderation of articles on potentially controversial topics. Post-moderation to allow readers to report offensive topics which will be hidden from view until moderated.
__label__Evidence	there are bigger issues.  we could fund the NHS if we can tackle our increasing social care costs.  Get the able back to work 
__label__Evidence	The creation of specific platforms to discuss this information often leads to groups with similar beliefs setting up their own platforms, which become a haven for hate speech and fake news
__label__Evidence	Some people could cloud hate speech as 'open mindedness' and use it as a way to push their agenda without taking responsibility.
__label__Position	The Palestinian genocide, Cost of living crisis, attitude to immigration, and attitude towards austerity
__label__Evidence	If the information was moderated & hidden if deemed to be hate speech then it would still exist for the purposes of feedback but not be visible within the comments section
__label__Evidence	All very important issues to consider when thinking about how to vote! I'm voting Green (probably) because of this, or potentially biting my tongue and voting Labour 
__label__Position	How do you propose this to be executed?
__label__Evidence	true.. even universal credit is not enough to pay rent, food and bills ..  
__label__Position	I do not believe voting is the solution to any of the problems as people we face. The sysyem It's self is broken and needs to be compleatly  changed
__label__Position	Newspaper websites may eliminate comments, employ moderators, or limit comments to subscribed users. There are options to address hateful comments.
__label__Position	space for comments does not belong on newspaper websites
__label__Position	I am for a monitored comment section. Eliminating it completely might compel people to find other ways to leave hate speech comments.
__label__Position	I have been a lifelong Conservative voter but I have difficulty voting for them as they need to change. I find Labour untrustworthy. My dilema is either to continue with my faith or not vote as a protest
__label__Evidence	I agree. I personally enjoy posting my opinion thinking people think I'm smart. I don't know if I change people's minds but I think in the moment, I think I'm both clever and nice. If I couldn't comment, it'd ruin the whole Facebook post experience for me. (Source: My experience)
__label__Evidence	I dont believe in censorship though. Commentary and opinions are important. We cannot say that just because some people might believe fake news we should only have one government authorized news source to protect people. People need to be less sensitive and also be aware enough to not take everything they read as being true.
__label__Evidence	Discriminatory words could be automatically blocked which will certainly reduce hate speech to some extent
__label__Position	There are a number of organizations which work to eradicate hate speech especially on social media as it is a form of cyber bullying
__label__Position	I think we should just collect personal information. It works in South Korea. People will behave if their are not anonymous. Modertors are important too, but not enough,
__label__Evidence	On heavily discussed topics, there may be too many comments to properly moderate. The burden may be too high to manually do this.
__label__Evidence	agree, 14 years of government and theyve wrecked the quality of life for many people at the benefit of others
__label__Evidence	Crowdsource moderation is a great idea, similar to reddit where people can vote, but there are still moderators who can remove posts completely if they break sub rules
__label__Evidence	A certain language criteria would be a better solution , restricting the limitations to ways of expression only 
__label__Evidence	Fully agree
__label__Position	Tories have been bad, but Labour will be no better
__label__Evidence	Totally agree. It still gives space to express but will limit the hate speech
__label__Evidence	This could be done through public opinion, such as what the general public would consider less restricted and what is acceptable in current society.
__label__Position	No one should be able to post hate speech comments or remarks. There must be moderations in place that regulate such comments and conduct.
__label__Evidence	I agree is a matter of political will above everything else
__label__Evidence	Regulations fail, and extremists will point to any minor failing as strong proof of their firmly held beliefs.
__label__Position	There is always going to be hate speech and comments, that is the way of the world unfortunately these days.  But I do think it needs monitored more closely
__label__Evidence	I agree - the state of education is a mess!
__label__Position	there should be repercussions to posting hate comments and moderators or software that stop the hate comments so that everyone still gets freedom of speech
__label__Position	There should be more moderators who can 'hide' offensive comments that can still be seen by the poster, as well as their contacts
__label__Position	Cost of living going up while quality of services and everything else is going down.
__label__Evidence	Those are key factors for me too but unfortunately the major parties have not really about them! 
__label__Evidence	I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated, but I don't think that it requires the total removal of space for comments, as the comments add value. I believe that moderation is the way forward.
__label__Position	i Think people who believe the comment section should be removed should read this article.  https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__Position	immigration too high
__label__Position	nhs and economy
__label__Evidence	"The united states supreme court has upheld the right to anonymity: McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/514/334/ ""Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority"""
__label__Position	Removing comment sections would be beneficial as hate speech can be very harmful to many groups of people, even if some would see it as eliminating free speech.
__label__Position	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__Position	The EU should take stronger action against Israeli settlement expansion
__label__Evidence	"I quote ""Hate speech is defined as bias-motivated, hostile, malicious speech aimed at a person or a group of people because of some of their actual or perceived innate characteristics."" (https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea) If a comment is hate speech, it is mutually exclusive to being valid criticism."
__label__Position	Some people are really stuck in their own beliefs and views that education will not change their perspective. This however should not deter us from having necessary discourse on important societal issues because actual people die in some cases because  of hate speech
__label__Evidence	It may lead to an underground subculture or racists, homophobes who avoid this format
__label__Evidence	I'm really worried about the NHS too 
__label__Evidence	Reduces the amount of troll comments
__label__Evidence	there is enough money, its just not managed well... this seems to be the issue with a lot of things 
__label__Position	After going through all the other comments ,my opinion on the topic has not changed. Newspaper Websites are where people should get the news from ONLY,  not write their opinions. They can go express their opinion else where about what they have read , not on the website.
__label__Evidence	yes, and full of impossible promises
__label__Position	Hate speech will always appear on open forums.  The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__Position	Improve listening and dialogue between institutions/politicians and citizens
__label__Position	More accountability is needed for not stamping down on hate speech
__label__Position	How can anyone restore  the NHS with the constant amount of immigrants joining the system
__label__Evidence	Not if the idea is hateful to minorities.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely agree, everything is in ruin
__label__Position	Moderation should be taken perhaps slightly more seriously - and for websites like Metro and MailOnline this is done so through active moderation rather than technological triggers. This link: https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/25756/html/ shows a pretty coherent list of moderating activity for the DMG group and it is promising to see that particular stories (often of a sensitive nature or relating to criminal cases) are not open to receive comments on public forums. It is often forgotten that news outlets' primary intention is to inform - it is only in recent decades that the element of discourse has been implemented (at least easily and openly, outside of writing into a newspaper to voice an opinion).
__label__Evidence	encourages social participation and reflection
__label__Position	Improve EU foresight capabilities to better anticipate crises
__label__Evidence	Often people are just looking for information and news anyone. After all paper newspapers don't have a comment section that anyone can just have their comment appear in automatically!
__label__Evidence	I dont agree with this, if hate speech is causing societal issues it should be talk about in the news
__label__Evidence	Cant be onesided as thats too bias, balanced viewpoint is better
__label__Position	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech
__label__Evidence	I would agree, with addition that also misinformation, especially one that could induce negative consequences  should be treated the same as hate speech
__label__Position	I feel strongly on the fact that despite the troubles they can create, without them would limit the possibility for conversation. They will begin to use this feature as a scapegoat and we will be worse off as a result! https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Evidence	I agree, the comment section should likely remain but be heavily moderated and regulated to disallow hate speech as the article above says
__label__Evidence	Yes however, it would at least stop the effect hate speech has on others
__label__Position	I think that what people comment should be monitored, we cannot allow people to celebrate racism, homophobia and fatphobia all in the name of free speech.
__label__Evidence	Cybersecurity would have to be very strong if you mean physical addresses...
__label__Evidence	Exactly this - we get what we pay for 
__label__Evidence	I dont think you can use all means necessary to eradate hate speech.  You can only control how you react to it
__label__Evidence	even electric cars are not great for the environment.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites may provide reasons of the consequences of hate speech comments.
__label__Position	Cost of living crisis and strain on public services including NHS 
__label__Evidence	already said
__label__Evidence	There should be more put in place to stop all the greedy landlords buying up properties to make a fortune off those who battle to get deposits together.  
__label__Evidence	Could be effective to some extent as it could prevent hate speech being available on these websites
__label__Evidence	It might lead to fake profiles
__label__Evidence	This article (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512786.2013.859838?casa_token=V_anYAQrBCIAAAAA%3A8IhQZy8qfCjnjwaIRbnec33KKLtJ-bMtB2hlHbj2F-zaeHbi--55gbSq8lsDIkCmhmSQE1khpVZRD9M) states that comments are integral to keeping news fresh and discussed. Having news discussed by people is what sparks change in our society, so they are still important and probably shouldn't be removed!
__label__Evidence	Yes, you can have your own opinion but that doesnt mean you have the right to spread hate.
__label__Position	Maybe if there is a surplus of messages left then all foulmouth comments could be sifted out, allthough i agree this could leed to bias
__label__Evidence	Removal of hate speech is not too much power, but hate speech needs to be clearly defined and a set of rules adhered to.
__label__Position	being more conservative minded
__label__Evidence	I was quite happy when they were saying Rishi might fall in his constituency as that would be the ultimate put down for a sitting PM but sadly, they're now saying he might just hang on. I'd take your pick for sure!
__label__Evidence	This is a horribly uninformed and unnecessarily inflammatory opinion, EmilyN. Are you saying that people who want to target, insult, and threaten others should be more protected that the people who are being threatened (i.e. the victims)? Just food for thought.
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree. More Tax.
__label__Position	Hate speech has no place in online debate. However, suggestions to use moderators to police forums are heavily flawed, as such processes will be open to personal bias. Who decides what constitutes hate speech? The notion of 'rewiring' perspectives, and 'tracking down' posters seems very authoritarian and not in keeping with a free and democractic society. However, people being unable to post from anonymous accounts would probably be beneficial.
__label__Position	NHS when are we going to pay our doctors and nurses what they deserve?
__label__Position	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree that removing anonymity online can help to moderate behaviour. With anonymity online users lose their inhibitions and can be more extreme as shown in this article https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noam-Lapidot-Lefler/publication/220495001_Effects_of_anonymity_invisibility_and_lack_of_eye-contact_on_toxic_online_disinhibition/links/5f9590ce92851c14bce5ae0c/Effects-of-anonymity-invisibility-and-lack-of-eye-contact-on-toxic-online-disinhibition.pdf
__label__Evidence	The NHS is a bottomless pit. However much money you put in it will be spent and more required.
__label__Evidence	what's the point in having comments at all if people are not allowed free speech?
__label__Position	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__Position	It may be useful to have some form of online policing force to moderate the newspaper website. This is suggested by the research published in Police Practice and Research: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15614263.2021.1919109
__label__Position	There will be a shift away from traditional political parties and structures
__label__Position	Hate comments should never be allowed or condoned
__label__Position	living with covid will need much new investment in primary care
__label__Position	The solution to this problem is to NEVER allow opinions on news topics to be added (no comment section) we all have different views which is going to lead to problems occurring hence why no comment section no hate speech, its like a newspaper article
__label__Evidence	It can limit hate comments
__label__Evidence	I agree, education is the best way in stopping this in the future https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/preventive-role-of-education
__label__Position	Being vegan doesn't solve the collective issue of big farming and the drastic loss of biodiversity. Carbon footprint is not the singular way to measure sustainability. 
__label__Evidence	new party need to be in power
__label__Position	Just one key issue - get the Tories out.
__label__Position	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__Evidence	Agree, seems to easy for them to avoid paying their fair share of tax
__label__Position	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__Position	Comments should be monitored, or IP addresses banned if they contribute to hate speech
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is not the same  thing as criticism. Criticism should be respectful and objective.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech should be allowed on the website but with clear guidelines. If someone breaks any rules, they will be blocked.
__label__Evidence	Opinions can damaging and should not always be shared
__label__Position	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__Evidence	we can never be sure when it comes to people. It will be dangerous should people be allowed to express themselves
__label__Position	We need to improve transparency and measurement of sustainability in food systems
__label__Position	Educate people about it
__label__Position	Economy, education and social care
__label__Evidence	People wont be able to express themselves
__label__Position	Cracking down on hate speech on newspaper websites is effective, but it only means that those spouting the speech go and do it somewhere else... https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/crackdown-on-online-hate-speech-pushes-extremists-to-other-platforms
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__Evidence	The Rwanda policy is unbelievably expensive. 
__label__Evidence	People  are waiting too long to see consultants and operations are being cancelled at last minute. 
__label__Position	I think removing the entire comment section is not a solution because hwen people do domething bad we cannot ban the entire platform. If people are stealing money we cannot close all the banks. We can try to reduce the robbery!
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	no one can afford anything these days
__label__Evidence	it is a thin line to censorship
__label__Position	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__Evidence	The fact we are discussing it with different responses is evidence of your point that it is a very difficult question to find a solution to.
__label__Evidence	I like the balanced approach suggested.
__label__Position	"NHS and how it can be ""fixed"" by various parties. Anything to do with pensions, University feesand tax"
__label__Evidence	Europe is risk-averse when it comes to new agricultural technologies
__label__Evidence	"""We may have destroyed the planet and doomed humanity to extinction, but for a beautiful moment in time we did create a lot of value for shareholders!."""
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is complex and jubjective. AI is still developing and not good enough to understand basic debate let alone interpret language, Too easy for AI to take words out of context.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a very serious problem and it is more evident online as anyone and everyone can write anything without fear. in as much as we all have freedom of speech, that freedom should not be used as a weapon against other people.
__label__Position	No , I think that would seriously limit freedom of speech 
__label__Evidence	moderators
__label__Evidence	Maybe just turn the comments off what are obviously polarising matters.
__label__Evidence	Many technologies like electric vehicles still plug into the grid and use fossil fuels. We do not have a zero emission grid yet.
__label__Position	I am voting for the party that I feel will make a difference.We need a change
__label__Position	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__Position	I think it's important to remember that free speech doesn't remove consequences of that speech but people who may have views which the majority of people don't support are rarely coming at it with an intention of 'hate' and having the difficult discussions might be the only way they will be exposed to the information which might change their thinking
__label__Evidence	I agree that we, as humans, can adapt to the situation as best as possible. But we can also take small steps towards change. The situation doesn't have to be impossible. 
__label__Evidence	yes, the lack of consequences is the problem. We can see from somewhere like facebook where peoples info is so easy to find that people have had negative consequences over their hateful posts so clearly being able to link back the comment to the person can help
__label__Evidence	I automatically disregard any party which puts another down! None of them are worth their salt, but not voting isn't going to help either.
__label__Position	Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments. However to stop people from expressing their opinions is creating another problem altogether. Those who aren't able to make help contributions should be blocked and stripped of their right to do so.
__label__Position	ithink the best thing to do is to not have comments as that can really alter someone elses perception. Especially in this day and age people tend to rely on comments to then pass their own judgement and that can cause hate speech. However if the comments were to still be present i think an idea would be to mute comments that incite any type of hate.
__label__Position	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__Evidence	Everyone should be included in dialogue, not just the middle
__label__Position	For me, the most surprising position expressed here was that there should be no limits on online commenting by the public. I am concerned that such an approach would lead to dissemination of hateful views by a small minority of commenters. According to www.poynter.org, National Public Radio in the U.S. did a survey and found that only 0.06 per cent of users actually commented on their website and that 491,000 comments actually only came from 20,000 individuals. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Position	People are allowed to have different views on certain topics and to engage with others on newspaper websites but this will be prevented by hate speech which may make other readers to stop reading
__label__Position	Provide a clear definition on what is considered hate speech and eliminate those comments that fit in that definition
__label__Position	The problem with moderating means that people may have a stance on what counts as a hate comment and may cause differing opinions and deletions of stuff that may just be outside someone's comfort zone https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Position	People should be able to regulate their opinions so as to not encourage hateful speech.
__label__Evidence	This should have been thought about many years ago. I believe things are too far gone to ever be able to get the planet back to normal again
__label__Evidence	also, less caddle means less incentives for deforestation
__label__Position	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__Position	The difficulty with reducing hate speech, is that it is everywhere. It cannot feasibly be reduced with human power, but rather requires a computer system. The difficulty with an electronic system, is that it inherently requires money and financing, and therefore is incentivised to make money. When money is in the equation; thoughts, politics and ideas can be easily manipulated by those funding the system
__label__Position	Not a fan of 16 year olds being able to vote.
__label__Position	a higher proportion of people on the website strongly agree with the views expressed, and the majority of views expressed are in favour of allowing it to continue, however it is only a small majority and not significant.
__label__Position	it should target the insulting and violation to individual and groups right by law or common morality  
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think it would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	giving away personal/sensitive information
__label__Evidence	I mean sure voting for fascism is definitely a change but probably not the one that we should go for
__label__Position	It looks as if the Government have been trying in recent years to develop plans for tackling hate crime - including targeting schools, working with newspapers and media to spread the word.
__label__Position	Unfortunately, the public's view on acts of terrorism (including domestic) can be strongly swayed by the effective use of such innocent feeling things as comment sections, as these groups may flood such sections underneath reporting of their own acts with sympathetic or 'this isn't an issue' type posts, thus influencing others' opinions directly or indirectly.
__label__Position	providing equality for all
__label__Position	Investing in green energy so we're no longer dependent on foreign (unreliable) sources
__label__Evidence	Good!
__label__Evidence	Less people will be willing to pay.
__label__Position	Climate change is happening and speeding up as we go on. It should be the #1 priority for EVERYONE to find ways to resolve this. PERIOD
__label__Position	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__Position	by providing some form of censorship on the comments put up
__label__Position	People forget that comments do not just go into a vast vacum online, they can have real damaging effects. Here is an article from 2014 which beautifully summarises by saying that assertions that they are just comments gives no humanity to victims - https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Evidence	While I see the logic to this argument, the publics interaction with paper newspapers and slower press looks to have declined according to this article, therefore I'm not sure this solution would work: https://clubs.waketech.edu/wake-review/magazine/creative-writing/non-fiction/the-decline-in-newspapers-a-closer-look-joseph-ahrens/
__label__Evidence	It is true, there is freedom of speech, all readers should be able comment on what they think
__label__Position	The Economy, health and education
__label__Position	Ensuring there is a process of discipline involved for anyone participating in hate speech. Measures such as warnings or account determination may be taken.
__label__Position	add a set of blacklisted words that people can not post and will be automatically removed and also have moderaters that read all posted comments are are able to remove and comment that may contain hate speech
__label__Position	The best way would be to introduce some kind of moderators who have clear definitions and limitations on what hate speech can be.
__label__Evidence	I definitely agree about environmental protection as the tories have backtracked so much.  Labour is usually stronger on education.  The jury is out on taxes though. 
__label__Evidence	I think with people reading less newspapers both hard copy and online, Print subscription circulations have fallen by 7% over the past two years, from 125 million overall to 116 million, while single-copy sales are down 11%, from 3.2 million in the first half of 2019 to 2.8 million in the first half of this year.17 Dec 2021, the papers are not going to give the time and effort to monitor the comments sections when there's nothing in it for them.
__label__Evidence	Reform of the system is needed.
__label__Evidence	I don't disagree that we have a problem with housing etc, but I don't feel comfortable with centering on overpopulation, as what does this mean for a solution... depopulation? And what does that lead to? That becomes an uncomfortable place
__label__Position	Proactive communication before issues become polarized is more effective
__label__Evidence	This is not in line with our right to freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__Evidence	Some issues may have fundamentally different visions of the future that are hard to reconcile
__label__Position	I fairly believe that the biggest issue at hand is the meaning behind freedom of speech and hate speech. Whenever people do post or write things that are hate speech, they hide behind the principle of freedom of speech. Newspapers and websites must be able to monitor and get opinions from the public about what to remove. Comment sections are really important to socialize and allow thought-provoking questions and ideas.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this too!! 
__label__Position	Looking at how Labour act when they have had power eg Welsh devolution, London mayor as an indicator of how a Labour run UK will look
__label__Position	Hate speech should be addressed by the public. Those who see the hateful comments should not continue pass it but rather bring it to others attention and stand against what is being said. The problem remains if everyone is not willing to do anything. Once people realise that there are consequences, that is when hate speech will reduce.  Read here: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Evidence	This limits free speech and reader engagement
__label__Evidence	Moderating will reduce hate speech and allow open discussion without personal, insulting opinions
__label__Position	Eliminating one's ability to express their opinions on a particular site does not change that opinion.  They'll just move to their own echo-chamber elsewhere where it'll fester without being challenged.  All that's needed is a reasonable degree of moderation to keep the discussion relatively civil where opponents can have their discussions out in the open.
__label__Evidence	so people who earned their wealth dont get to keep it?
__label__Evidence	Trans people are in long list of people used by this government to deflect from their own ineptitude.  Divide and conquer.  
__label__Position	By use of an algorithm that filters out misinformation and abuse. This would still enable free speech but not to the detriment of science or those that are vulnerable.
__label__Position	Correct ,technology is the need of today's humanity  but it should also help the nature side by side 
__label__Position	the fear labour will change society 
__label__Evidence	Problem being, who gets to decide what hate speech actually is? It's all very well claiming hate speech at the drop of at hat but often  it may be perceived as escalationary and over reactivity particularly to the level of juvenilty online discussion sometimes goes. I mean fine the web site providers are free to use their own discernment and reasonably can determine what does or doesn't feature on their website but that is not really conducive to cultivation an active user base.
__label__Position	People should be allowed to comment
__label__Evidence	This has the potential to make the community look barren and devoid of chat with lots of comments being removed. Look at some of the political sections of reddit.com for examples
__label__Evidence	I feel they do have a responsibility to monitor trolling and abusive behaviour as this can be harmful to others. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.
__label__Position	People will become dumber. 
__label__Evidence	Persons can become very insensitive and offensive in the opinions given, especially in the unmoderated comments forums.
__label__Position	I agree. It is always good to allow people to express their opinions however readers of the comment should also be allowed the freedom to respond by either agreeing, disagreeing or flagging it as inappropriate if the comment is offensive.
__label__Position	Weakening ethics and goodwill because of AI 
__label__Position	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public
__label__Evidence	are they not all the same, none fit to govern or lead
__label__Evidence	By holding them liabile it will remove negativity on the platform.
__label__Position	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__Position	Technology should be used to detect and remove hate speech. An example of how well this has worked is Facebook (https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/hate-speech-prevalence-dropped-facebook/) which said hate speech has dropped by almost 50% with their algorithms.

__label__Evidence	It s unclear how to handle mutually exclusive or polarized opinions
__label__Evidence	The most inspiring leadership is natural, organic, open and honest.
__label__Evidence	"@LawrenceM and @AndrewA said it best. This world is already in utter chaos. Humanity? Is that even a thing anymore. Lets's not add further to a world which is breeding hate, discrimination, selfish propoganda, etc on a daily basis. And for the love of all things good, let's use our limited time and energy on this earth to promote tolerance, acceptance and understanding when dealing with matters or situations that we find uncommon or ""alien""to us."
__label__Evidence	The world is changing in terms of human empowerment and the connectedness of the individual and the transparency of the powers that be. The opinions of the people CAN be heard and change is possible. Humanity needs to work together and gain strength from one another.
__label__Position	Removing the Tory party. health & social care, housing, economy.
__label__Position	the state of the NHS, the level of poverty, Conservatives getting away with many things and going unpunished
__label__Evidence	I do agree with you, but I think the people also should have a way of reporting comments.
__label__Evidence	should be included in free speech
__label__Evidence	all the leader of late are a laughing stock
__label__Evidence	I agree that we have to be very careful around censorship. Shutting commentary down because it doesn't fit your agenda or internal narrative can be very dangerous as it is a tool used by dictators.
__label__Evidence	Current frameworks may be inadequate for addressing complex, systemic challenges
__label__Position	https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ shows that the exposure to hate speech on one of the biggest websites (FB) was only 0.11%. Surely this shows that there shouldn't be an overall ban on comments sections? Monitoring must be working.
__label__Position	The vast majority of digital news consumers - that is 76% in America, read comments sections. This means by removing them were missing a big chance at limiting the harmful effects of echo chambers and encouraging consumers to think critically and question things
__label__Position	This link shows that in 2020 Facebook reported that exposure to hate speech was only 0.11% which I think is a pretty good argument for not putting a blanket ban on comments sections https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/
__label__Evidence	This is a good idea, there are a lot of sites that use AI bots that block out hate speech, bad words, and they are more appropriate for all ages. Keeps the tone of the comments at a decent level
__label__Position	However many newspapers have chosen to cancel out the commenting section on the newspaper websites saying that they prefer that their readers comment on their social media platforms as they will still post there and they will not cancel or remove the comment section.
__label__Evidence	There would potentially be reduction of hate speeches, but similarly there would be removal of positive speeches/opinions.
__label__Evidence	i agree with the comment about fake news, a lot of people reading online articles are vulnerable to taking information at face value without checking whether or not there is actual evidence for this
__label__Evidence	i think  this is correct but i do feel that there is more that technology can do to help these days too
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	Seems to involved and complicated for most to even want to try.
__label__Position	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__Evidence	We can always try to reduce it. It's important to let people with good intentions comment and protect them against hate speech commets, than can do a lot of harm https://www.coe.int/en/web/cyberviolence/online-hate-speech-and-hate-crime
__label__Position	And after we have learned to love each other, they wont be anytime for hatred speech
__label__Evidence	Standards which keep users behaviour respectful towards one another should be reinforced throughout discussion boards!
__label__Position	Cost of living is way too high, also re-privatise the Rail lines, Gas, electric, as these are run by greedy big companies
__label__Position	Not only hate speech but also internalized stereotypes has awful effect on online discussions: Please check this article. Moderation is a great idea as informed mods can decrease both hate speech and internalized stereotypes in the comments: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-018-0941-5
__label__Evidence	Agree entirely, but answers to questions like this come there none when politicians are talking about their policies on housing - it's all about numbers of houses and very little about who they are for and how the likes of young people can realistically get on the housing ladder.
__label__Position	I disagree with  the idea that hate speech is free speech as nothing that perpetuates targetted violence should be done freely without consequence.People on the internet need to watch what they say the same way they would when engaged in a conversation in the real world.For those that choose to not adhere it is imperative that they are removed from these platforms and banned from creating other accounts.

__label__Evidence	I disagree......
__label__Evidence	People are really struggling with rent prices 
__label__Evidence	This might be true, but the key is developing  the pathway, which means advice. Cheap access to more qualified advisors is the solution, not downgrading heritage value in the planning balance.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section is will only prohibit the sharing of opinions and views and it may not necessarily eradicate hate speech.
__label__Position	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.
__label__Position	I fully agree with Labour's intention to make it easier for Brits to develop home-grown skills so we don't have to rely on immigrants doing jobs we could have done if the training had been available.
__label__Evidence	It's their arrogance that really gets to me. They have all these scandals, all these screwups, and then try to tell us that they're the only party that can handle the problems the country faces, many of which they're responsible for. They act like they're born to rule 
__label__Position	It is important to allow everybody to express their opinion, even if it is hate speech.If you see too much hate speech, it should make you reflect on why so many are so hateful toward the subject. It is  a way to find out the real emotions of people, be it hate or good and to study the subject in this perspective
__label__Evidence	no hate
__label__Position	Someone mentioned in this site that although freedom of speech is given to everyone, an algorithm should be in place to eliminate comments including hate speech in the newspaper where everyone is reading the newspaper. It would be unfair that the people are reading and for them to be reading rude and foul comments.
__label__Position	but still people are bias, especially when it comes to serious matter/ or personal matter
__label__Evidence	Eliminating the space for reader comments would be violating free speech, in my opinion it would be much better to have every incident recorded as a Non-crime hate incident'. The government needs to have stricter and clearer laws on what entails hate crime and hate incidents.
__label__Evidence	I totally agree with this. I don't understand how much more it will take before humans do something to make significant changes. We are often reactive instead of proactive but in this case our efforts will most likely be to late to significantly alter the course we are on.
__label__Evidence	I think that removing peoples ability to comment would be more harm than good because they will just do it elsewhere like social media platforms.
__label__Position	no, after all news paper should represent freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	Passing hateful speeches is not basic right of freedom of speech, rather you are checking how peoples comment could affect society. People need to be banned and removed from passing those comments to put positive energy on media platforms.
__label__Evidence	Healthcare is really important to me. I think the government have been using immigration to blame their poor governance, it gives them someone to blame.  
__label__Position	if a comment is going to hurt someone then it  should not be published
__label__Position	The problem with directly challenging hate speech, as a focus, can actually reflect the biases of those doing so, or even software. This can lead to minorities actually being disproportianately flagged for hate speech, despite more often being the victims of this rhetoric online (https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/15/20806384/social-media-hate-speech-bias-black-african-american-facebook-twitter)

__label__Position	I think it's probably better to know what a person is thinking, whether that's positive/neutral/negative than to just delete or ignore it. The idea of accountability and not hiding behind a user ID is a good one. People might actually begin to think about what they're saying before posting.
__label__Evidence	I do agree that sometimes people can mistake different opinions as hate speech but I do think it is quite easy to understand that hate speech involves language that disrespect the person you are talking to
__label__Evidence	there is no guarantee that other platforms will not also have hate speech, if anything they might even encourage it more as they may attract a particular group of people who are interested in spreading hate speech
__label__Evidence	"How much hate speech is there really on newspaper comments sections? Usually a difference of opinion is enough for some people to lurch for the ""hate speech"" card in order to get a comment removed because they don't like a different viewpoint."
__label__Position	Leadership in the OU should allow everyone to demonstrate leadership capabilities - it is not about hierarchical positions, anyone can be a leader
__label__Position	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.

__label__Evidence	People have worked hard for their money and paid tax on it. Why is there a need to tax someone who works hard and invest even more/
__label__Position	I still think comments should be monitored by AI for certain phrases and reactions. A reporting feature can be used to flag posts and remove them either by AI or a real person

__label__Evidence	Would benefit society more in long term.
__label__Evidence	I don't think this is appropriate if it is harmful to others.
__label__Position	Ending privatization and moving back to the public sector
__label__Evidence	This is a fine point. Though if I take a more literal stance, this kind of deletion wouldn't happen as the moderators wouldn't accept it in the first place? If they did decide to remove posts afterwards, the interference may become more and more common, resulting in a news publisher that is increasingly political - something you'd want to avoid on a platform that gives people a range of speech and perspectives.
__label__Position	I think most of us share a unanimous idea which is that restricting the comments section is not so beneficial in the long run, and that internal measures  can be taken to deal with the issue of hate speech . This article shows how hate speech can be effectively tackled https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/why-tackle-hate-speech
__label__Position	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer
__label__Position	In a lot of developing countries, dairy is a primary source of protein specially for kids. So no, this seems extreme.

__label__Evidence	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170
__label__Position	By blocking rotten apples who spew hate speech immediately
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	It would still need to be moderated as the users can radicalise themselves
__label__Position	I guess hate speech is open to interpretation.   What might be interpreted as hate speech or offensive by me might not be the case for my fellow citizen. So it is a really fine line.  So how do you manage that effectively?  Will an AI be sufficient?  Costs for human intervention would be too high.

__label__Position	One of the biggest challenges in achieving sustainable agriculture is effectively conveying the need for change and transformation to rural communities. Many farmers and rural practitioners are deeply rooted in traditional farming methods, and transitioning to sustainable practices can be seen as risky or impractical without clear, tangible benefits. Resistance to change is often compounded by limited access to education, training, and resources necessary for implementing new techniques. Additionally, there's a significant gap between innovative agricultural research and its practical application in the field. Bridging this gap requires not only technological progress and innovation but also effective communication and demonstration of sustainable practices' long-term benefits and feasibility. Collaboration between different stakeholders can be improved by fostering stronger connections between researchers and field practitioners. Creating platforms for regular interaction and knowledge exchange can help translate scientific research into practical solutions that are easily adoptable by farmers. Extension services, demonstration farms, and participatory research projects can play a critical role in this process. Additionally, leveraging technological advancements such as digital farming tools, mobile apps, and remote sensing can provide farmers with real-time information and support. Policymakers can also facilitate collaboration by developing policies and incentives that encourage innovation and the adoption of sustainable practices. By involving farmers in the research process and making them active participants in the development and testing of new technologies, we can ensure that solutions are both practical and impactful, ultimately leading to a more sustainable agricultural system.
__label__Evidence	I agree with you here but along with the response above I also agree that Labours candidates are not wholly promising either.  In my honest opinion I feel neither would do as promised within their manifestos but we will, as per usual just have to trust the process.  One thing is for sure, the Conservatives need to go.

__label__Evidence	Farmers are already heavily consulted, but their input often doesn t lead to action
__label__Position	Have filtering algorithms on the newspaper website to filter out comments that could be viewed as hate speech.
__label__Position	Have guidelines to control what is allowed to be commented.
__label__Position	i would say having the option to report an offensive comment would help, other than nothing at all because then that is a start to correcting someone's choice of words or point of view.
__label__Position	Housing affordability, NHS
__label__Evidence	Totally agree but the team of moderators might be a high cost for the newspaper, especially if they need to evaluate every comment
__label__Evidence	"I do not agree with the idea of submitting a large amount of personal data. That is unenforceable and goes against the GDPR. I also do not understand the 're-education' argument. Who is supposed to educate them and are these supposed ""educators"" professionally qualified?"

__label__Position	You can not, which is a sad state of affairs, there cant be free speech without hate speech. The world i now more tolerate of it and it does not shock in the same ways that it used to
__label__Evidence	Allowing those to post it anonymously gives them the okay to do it over and over again without being called out over it.
__label__Evidence	Critical discussions are essential to democratic nations
__label__Evidence	I agree. What does it help to not even try to change the advancement of climate change?
__label__Evidence	Controversial topics should be decided on how sensitive the information or event would be to groups that are targeted with hate speech due to protected characteristics e.g race, religion, gender, sexuality etc.
__label__Evidence	I think it is important to a) get the tories out and b) make sure reform dont have too strong a foothold. Farage in one way or another has been reasonable for the downfall of the country.  For myself i would rather we follow a scandinavian model than an american one
__label__Evidence	interesting, I can agree but still write a con

__label__Position	Newspapers -should- be taking responsibility for making sure users don't violate hate speech regulations and similar in their comments sections, but simply don't seem to be held accountable when they don't. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=The%20New%20Governors:%20The%20People,%20Rules%20and%20Processes%20Governing%20Online%20Speech
__label__Evidence	I appreciate that everyone has the right to freedom of speech but at the expense of others and being hateful?
__label__Evidence	For sure I think UK diplomacy is going to need to work over time to make sure the world comes out the other side of Donald Trumps next presidency! He's a lunatic! 
__label__Evidence	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Evidence	good decision to remove the comment
__label__Position	Bad comments have to go if you got a bad comment you should delete and report
__label__Position	Healthcare and looking after our most neediest
__label__Position	I think that eliminating the comments section altogether might be a useful idea as even moderators might not be effective in controlling the hate speech in comments section.
__label__Evidence	Allows less bias when reading or consuming news content
__label__Evidence	I agree that Labour are going to win but I really don't agree that the reductive nonsense spouted by Reform has anything to offer this country
__label__Evidence	Have you actually read the comments on a newspaper article!
__label__Position	what theyll be doing to help climate change and palestine
__label__Evidence	who do you think can turn things around? It is definitely needed 
__label__Position	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__Evidence	People should be allowed to give their opinions because where else will be able to read how people feel about certain things happening around other than comments. I just think they should be monitored and taught to not post hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	The United Nations have outlined what hate soeech is here, so this could be used overall as a rule of thumb... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Evidence	Getting the Tories out is the first step towards a better and brighter Britain - not sure Labour can achieve that but whatever anyone says, they're still the better option over Conservatives by a long shot. 
__label__Position	We could monitor responses, blacklisting offensive words and possibly having unbiased humans monitor it
__label__Evidence	we can't trust people to follow standards
__label__Position	Our country indeed can not take anymore, we are a tiny island.
__label__Evidence	crime is a big concern in this country and I want the new Government to focus on this too.
__label__Position	I think the best way is to block or censor certain words. Especially words that are synonymous with hate speech. Or better yet, have moderators in comments sections.
__label__Evidence	There are some good points however in having news sites require users to submit data they risk each users' privacy and right to anonymity. This could be increadibly dangerous and would encourage people to stop using the site
__label__Evidence	Technology alone cannot solve democratic challenges
__label__Position	Another way for the community to participate in moderation may be to issue genuine warnings to people, this also goes more towards the root of the problem, telling people they are in the wrong, rather than shutting the door on them so they can post their opinion somewhere else. https://www.popsci.com/technology/nyu-researches-hate-speech-warnings-twitter/
__label__Position	1st argument: allowing hate speech to fester online is detrimental and can be hurtful to others. It can have horrific consequences. By moderating and removing hate speech comments, this should prevent any negative consequences from occurring.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is not freedom of consequence. The paradox of tolerance is a very good example of why intolerant or hate speech is not the same as having the freedom to express your dislike of something that is not a person's identity or existence. To have the opinion that a group of people deserves to die simply because they are a certain race is an intolerant, disgusting, and genocidal belief. That should not be tolerated.
__label__Position	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__Evidence	because no
__label__Evidence	Rent should definitely be capped based on area / property type etc, it may deter landlords from entering the market but the greed on show at the moment is just ridiculous 
__label__Evidence	People buy papers knowing the paper's political stance. I read articles to understand a journalist's perspective.
__label__Evidence	I agree. The wages increase but this isn't inline with the cost of basic living conditions 
__label__Evidence	unfortunately hospitals are so understaffed and under resourced - it will take years to train and retain staff - there is no incentive to work for the NHS anymore and it is arguably one of the most important jobs for our country.
__label__Evidence	I think people should have the right to comment but should do so respectfully.
__label__Evidence	Agree. Certain words can be filtered and if triggered comment can be removed
__label__Position	This does sound like a difficult one. There is need for moderators and people who can or artificial intelligence that can screen and delete such comments. I do not think that educating people on being nice will work as some are just bitter for nothing.
__label__Position	I believe a more thorough discussion on what the purpose behind removing those comments is warranted. Is it to try and reduce hate? Is it to protect readers? to not give negativity a breeding ground? If it is primarily to protect readers from hate speech, then any counterargument involving hate speech slipping through is void as it is about reducing frequency as much as possible.
__label__Evidence	I don't agree. There are too many people who shouldn't have access to the Internet. They hide behind their PC screens and writes a lot of things they would never dare to say in reality. They believe they can say everything that comes to their minds when they can hide behind a PC screen, and that lowers the quality in the comments section. And there are laws against racism and other topics than they can use as triggers.
__label__Evidence	The following article is supporting that https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116310118
__label__Evidence	"I agree to a certain extent - like Wikipedia, if anyone can contribute then there is no way to validate what's been said, and it can create ""Fake News""."
__label__Position	"As good as ai and things may be at removing only hateful comments it's bound to mess up and it's a risky route to take taking the control out of the hands of humans for such a sensitive topic as to what is ""hateful"". Just removing the comment section is obviously far safer so it's understandable why some newspapers have done so. Honestly just having a stronger vetting process where every comment has to be approved manually is probably the safest procedure, but maybe have the person doing the vetting to be as unbiased as possible to try to only remove hateful comments and not stifle free speech."
__label__Evidence	Give option to delete bad comments
__label__Position	I am concerned about the economy and growth of the UK.  I am also interested in the tax position of the various paries
__label__Evidence	Offers good ways to combat hate speech on newspaper websites.
__label__Position	home ownership
__label__Evidence	Current regulations are insufficient to address the challenges posed by social media and AI
__label__Evidence	Economy is growing. NHS is important but doesn't work and am i the only one who can get seen by a doctor quickly? never have a problem 
__label__Position	i agree free speech is im portant however it needs to be monitored carefully. free speech can very quickly turn into hate speech leading to crime and violence. much research has been done to show how serious hate speech can be and how much it leads on to other things
__label__Evidence	Even a simple thing such as re-entering regulatory alignment with the EU would help with imports and exports# 
__label__Position	Everyone want to know about the climate change increase due to Manmade cause.So first we want start to reduce the waste level in our home.It leads to changes in the society if else we will face the huge climate changes in coming decades.
__label__Position	Jerusalem is the key issue in resolving the conflict
__label__Evidence	We can never run away from hate speech
__label__Position	Unfortunately the Tories, Labour, Liberal Democrats, SNP, and particularly the racist Reform UK combined won't be able to sort out the cost of living crisis, or address issues we are having Worldwide .  We need to increases immigration, bring in more Drs and nurses to bolster up the NHS,  and all Public sector and low paid jobs
__label__Evidence	The impact of illegal migration is a smoke screen
__label__Evidence	Reduction in VAT on adaptive reuse projects down to 0% like new construction is offered is an obvious opportunity for legislation to bring about a circular approach (Katherine Gunderson)
__label__Evidence	Hate speech an be considered a form of verbal assault. Why should we accept that?
__label__Evidence	there  would be no hate speech
__label__Evidence	Newspaper articles are for delivering news not for people's opinion.
__label__Position	There surely must be a role here for AI to monitor comments and flag any that warrant attention? Also encouraging and allowing other people to report them so that they can be removed.
__label__Position	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__Evidence	I don't agree, actually 
__label__Position	"another way to curb hatespeech is using empathy, as using humour can ""fuel the flame""- https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/12/empathy-based-counter-speech-can-reduce-hate-speech.html"
__label__Evidence	It will filter out how people truly feel which defeats the purpose of freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	one-tone approach
__label__Position	Provide citizens with access to verified, non-polarizing information
__label__Position	I think this will affect free speech but I also agree that the option to comment on newspaper articles should be removed until a better solution can be found. Hate speech is serious and I believe the newspaper websites wouldn't remove the ability to comment unless they had no other choice. I agree with someone elses post that maybe having moderators in the comment sections would be a great start to ending hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree. too  much damage has already been done to reverse the process and many people are unwilling to make changes to their lives that may be too much for their budget to handle
__label__Position	By introduction of standards and moderation by set rules. - that would allow for posting ‘exchanging thoughts as long as they adhere to generic rules of the platform.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers are biased, therefore requires readers to fact-check and challenges their articles.
__label__Position	we dont need leaders that patronize discrimination and lie!
__label__Evidence	a more toward automation
__label__Position	Making clearer what behaviour the law prohibits   and increasing the consequences for breaking   the law   Replace the existing criminal provision with a new   criminal offence in the Crimes Act that is clearer and more effective   What is the current law?  As described earlier in this document (on page 12), there is a crime of intentionally “inciting   racial disharmony” in Aotearoa in section 131 of the Human Rights Act.   What is the problem with the current law?  This is a complicated provision and is difficult to understand. It uses four terms, “hostility”, “ill￾will”, “contempt”, and “ridicule” which have broad meanings and could also potentially overlap.   It also uses the word “excite” in a way that is not often used in day-to-day language. The Royal   Commission noted that, unlike the civil provision, it does not cover electronic communications.  What will this proposal do?  This proposal would create a new criminal provision in the Crimes Act that is clearer and easier   to understand than section 131 of the Human Rights Act.  Under this proposal, the terms “hostility”, “ill-will”, “contempt” and “ridicule” would be replaced   by “hatred”. This wording was suggested by the Royal Commission, which acknowledged that   the change would narrow the meaning of the words, when compared to the current offence.
__label__Evidence	If required, details can be handed to the authorities if there is a legal breach.
__label__Position	I believe the comment section should not be closed but however, people should voice out their views whilst being respectful. There is no reason to be mean and hit below the belt. Obviously we cant all have the same views but if we communicate well, we might learn more from our differences
__label__Position	Create a automated system that captures certain phrases or words and automatically flags and bans them.
__label__Evidence	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Evidence	I agree as many news papers in our days don't have comment sections as it is expensive and time consuming
__label__Position	I think we should lower tax honestly
__label__Evidence	I'm not sure they'd want us back!
__label__Position	The notion of moderators are useless. Let me remind you about how Suckerberg was questioned about his fact checkers. Also who fact checks the fact checkers?
__label__Position	People can be shown all the ways that they should act but if they are not held responsible they will not watch what they say https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	I'm also very concerned about getting GP appointments, it seems impossible since the pandemic
__label__Evidence	Some people may use AI responsibly 
__label__Evidence	I totally agree. There are people who like to read comments. It is also a right to express an opinion.
__label__Position	I am still of the standing that some type of programme should be used to identify hate speech key words or phrases and remove comments that include them.
__label__Position	Making a difference locally, more jobs, community and funding for growth
__label__Position	People will become dumber.
__label__Position	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__Evidence	agreed. people will always want their opinions heard
__label__Position	Our railway is a joke.
__label__Evidence	Even if it is moderated, who is to say that the moderator is unbiased and won't let some comments through even though they contain hate soeech
__label__Evidence	I'm 50/50 on this. Nothing is wrong with immigration if people are skilled and are willing to be skilled. If there is a lack of people wanting to up-skill, why not allow the immigrants to take the jobs!
__label__Position	Focus should be on shared goals rather than specific technologies or methods
__label__Evidence	Yeah. That's true anyway. Freedom of speech is good but protecting the citizens and preventing violence through hate speech is also great
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is used to intentionally hurt others. It cannot be allowed in modern-day society and should not be seen as free-speech
__label__Evidence	hate speech is discrimination, but people should be free to express themselves on websites because not every comment will be hate speech and other people inspire other from comments, without the comment space people will be unable to interact online.
__label__Evidence	This seems to have a slippery slope for restricting opinions.
__label__Evidence	I completely disagree with the notion of not voting as a form of protest, you can choose a strategic vote, where we align with a particular party's policies, just to balance out the representation, and allow some voice of reason to be able to speak-up
__label__Evidence	It can be difficult to monitor everything all the time, but I think if something is reported and not deleted then fair enough.
__label__Position	1st position: comments on newspaper articles should not be allowed
__label__Position	i think that if you are going to leave comments your name should also be published.if you could do it so people have to sign up before they can comment.
__label__Evidence	immigration could have been sorted out by training people to sort out who is genuinly seeking asylum , instead of giving billions to Rwanda
__label__Position	The most important question about filtering mechanisms is who controls them and how much power they have or should have. The concern for using a filter mechanism should be to hire a neutral service provider for it.  This should be confirmed by certificates or similar from independent institutions so that credibility is established.
__label__Position	I think that by removing anonymous commenting, you may stop a lot of people commenting at all which is bad for free speech. Not everyone who wants to remain private will use hate speech. Definitely more moderation would be a good idea though.
__label__Evidence	"I am quite impressed with the team that Starmer has around him - they seem to have experience at the ""coal face"""
__label__Position	I do not believe it is necessary to name and shame users of hate speech, as although their actions are wrong, this may lead to humiliation and darker thoughts, self harm or suicide. Repying to the comment with empathy and education may be the best guide, and if the action does not change, possibly a block.
__label__Evidence	reflecting on this, and the use of AI - here is a statement from Facebook about monitoring hate speech and now allowing these comments on the platform: https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/
__label__Position	Registering with ID is the single step that would improve incidences of hate speech in comments section. That coupled with live moderation either by AI or human, and following rules that can quickly adapt to change should greatly rduce hate speech.
__label__Position	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__Position	education as a whole has been well underfunded with priority subjects still no teachers
__label__Position	this is possibly the worst platform i have ever used for anything.

__label__Evidence	"""E.g. rebound effect."" (Crispin Edwards) "
__label__Evidence	Agree completely
__label__Position	Remaining free of EU interference, defence and tax
__label__Evidence	Agree, bio-fuels is not a clean form of energy. Rich countries support it as a cheap form of energy, yet it has a high CO2 profile
__label__Evidence	i normally just put a cross in the little box :)
__label__Evidence	This is simplistic and would be very limited in its effectiveness.
__label__Evidence	"""Indeed, adaptation and conversation sometimes in conflict"" (Steven Bee)"
__label__Position	All the recent leaders of the Conservatives starting with Boris Johnson have done damage to this country
__label__Evidence	I'd like to see new parties formed like in France but our voting system stops that happening
__label__Position	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__Position	Moderators approving posts before being public would be ideal, but expensive
__label__Position	I believe that comments should be regulated and any negative comments should simply be removed. Eliminating the chance to discuss topics freely isn´t the solution and shouldn´t be considered.
__label__Evidence	I agree, that feels like a reasonable approach. Although I'm a little bit skeptical what comes to its effectivity.
__label__Position	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech.  We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.
__label__Position	As already demonstrated by other bigger social media companies, algorithms often contain and reinforce the negative biases of its creators, so I'm not sure how effective they would be in detecting and filtering out hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Is there a particular country that you think does it well and we should model ours on? 
__label__Position	I think it would be a very good idea to have moderators on heavily commented on articles. Again I think it would help if comments were restricted to the article and people are not allowed to comment on what other people have said
__label__Evidence	I agree that moderators are all too often bias one way or the other so only extreme hate speech should be censored.
__label__Evidence	I think using personal data would be tricky. Many companies have been caught selling user's data without consent or storing it in an unsafe way, which could harm those affected by hate speech more than those who post it
__label__Evidence	I think it demonstrates clearly how often AI struggles to detect hate speech or misclassifies innocent content as hateful - it would just further restrict freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle.  Needs real time moderation.

__label__Position	Has anyone already done a postal vote? My vote is already locked in
__label__Evidence	That's a brilliant idea. Certain words do NOT need to be used and if they are they should be reviewed just incase.
__label__Position	there are people who go in the comment section just to argue and cause distress to other people commenting and that needs to be monitored and comments removed if necessary
__label__Evidence	"Define aggressive, some reddit subs ban gendered language which is over moderation in my opinion when you look at the content of a word not the technical definition of it sometimes. Like saying ""I'm having a bitch of a time"" vs ""you're a bitch""."
__label__Position	"I believe censoring hate speech does violate the freedom of speech right, however, hate speech that promotes danger, discrimination, and violence can be removed. ""Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under the law"" (https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech)"
__label__Evidence	l agree the ordinary people always suffer 
__label__Position	I also think the concept of Counterspeech to reduce the impact of hate speech could be beneficial.https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__Evidence	it's boring and unusable
__label__Evidence	I agree with this. It's important for the newspaper to know how readers feel and react to the content
__label__Position	Admins!!
__label__Position	I want to see the super wealthy taxed to the max so the money can be better used where it is really needed
__label__Evidence	I totally agree with this point because I think freedom of speech is fundamental in a modern and democratic society but at the same time we cannot avoid the fact that online hate speech have become a problem and we should deal with it
__label__Position	"I have to disagree with this, as in my opinion it is the responsibility of the newspaper websites to police it to some degree. If we look at this article: https://zdjp.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/poyhtari.pdf it is said that : ""The study shows that moderation is not the only solution to prevent hate speech and cyberhate, but generally, the whole structure of the comment fi elds has been designed in a way that effi - ciently prevents problematic content. The number of available discussions and the practice of pre- or postmoderation dictate, how freely people can participate and comment. Finnish and British sites allow the most discussion, while Swedish and Dutch news sites prefer selected discussions, moderated by professional moderation companies."" so because of this, i think that newspaper websites have great tools to control and deny hatespeech."

__label__Evidence	The comments section can not create fake news. It may attract people with extreme views but not people making up news themselves.
__label__Position	there must be a code of conduct which is publicly accessible to write a comment. comment themselves could have button on where any other person could consider the comment to behateful with a points system in place
__label__Evidence	Agree, in terms of cost, is an extremely -therefore not sustainable- expensive lifestyle. Only applicable to western societies
__label__Evidence	Definitely need to work on this 
__label__Position	Whilst newspapers have allowed hate speech in their comment sections, they themselves are biased in their opinions whether to one side of an argument or another and this shows in the news items printed. Perhaps having to give verified personal information before commenting  might stop trolls and hate speech.
__label__Evidence	This article is interesting - perhaps a suggestion to use moderating language, or an agreement to respond politely and moderately, should be 'e-signed' by users before contributing.
__label__Position	"Any ""hate"" speech not defined by the law, is not hate speech at all.  It is just a form of words that other people choose to find offensive, based on their attitudes and beliefs."
__label__Evidence	it's a survey question
__label__Position	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__Evidence	Good idea, however the elimination of hateful words won't completely eliminate hate speech altogether (ex. people can use alternate language)
__label__Evidence	There are now 4 pillars of sustainability, rather than 3. Culture was added as the 4th pillar - and this includes heritage (Nigel Griffiths)

__label__Evidence	Global market forces make it difficult to guarantee fair prices
__label__Position	I agree with that
__label__Position	I agree with so many of the comments above - there are some really good ideas. I think comment sections are needed in newspapers because it's a way to communicate and connect on different topics. There must be another way to reduce hate speech. Censoring words is a good idea. I also agree that it's now newspaper's sole responsibility to stop it so why should they have to remove the comment section.
__label__Evidence	agree. they have been nothing but disastrous.
__label__Position	animal rights
__label__Position	monitor the comments that are posted
__label__Evidence	i don't think submitting personal data is a good idea to reduce hate speech, it is invasive
__label__Position	I think we should have nice lamps at the office 
__label__Position	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__Position	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__Position	investmen tin people
__label__Evidence	Could exclude nasty comments
__label__Position	there should be rules that have to be followed and if someone does not follow the rules then their comment should not be able to get posted.
__label__Evidence	This would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.

__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	Maybe comments space should be programed to stop hate words while people type
__label__Position	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__Evidence	I don't think that we should choose either mitigation or adaptation. It seems that both are very useful tools to fight climate change and other environmental concerns.
__label__Evidence	It can be difficult to automate this monitoring
__label__Position	Through active moderation.
__label__Evidence	I agree, there's so many people that cannot afford to properly live anymore
__label__Evidence	The problem with this is that the moderator themselves often have an agenda.
__label__Evidence	I agree I think we should adapt the best we can. We can't change what has already happened.
__label__Position	I am concerned how money will be found to implement some stratagies
__label__Position	It would be easier if the submitted comment had to be approved before being posted.
__label__Evidence	We have to, it's what's best for ordinary people in this country.
__label__Position	Personally I think it would require a well developed algorithm moderated by a team that updates it regularly to make sure it flags the correct material and continually updates it's database of words, phrases and dogwhistles
__label__Evidence	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.

__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	no one can afford to rent a flat or house on their own now 
__label__Position	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.
__label__Position	I disagree and like to see others adding narrative and story to a topic.  If it was just about news then it might as well be a list of bullet points rather than human interest or social history

__label__Evidence	5478e52cfdf99b5322cf7f7b The war in Gaza has very little to do with us. I support giving aid to Palestine and selling defensive weapons to Israel but what is the electorate of a country half way across the world meant to do to sway this conflict?

__label__Position	I truly worry none of them will be any good! they say one thing then do another
__label__Position	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Position	"Possibly it depends on the story in the newspaper, but generally speaking does anyone really pay attention to the comments?  Sometimes people go out of their way to cause uproar and a lot of the comments, especially in the Daily Mail, are actually bots confessing true love to their ""princess Meghan"""
__label__Position	what type of resources do you mean? You mena money to buy/implement a good filtering too, or human resources for filtering data? In both cases I think these are factors that can affect indeed the filtering quality and therefore its fairness
__label__Position	The Council of Foreign Relations has noted that hate speech online does have real world implications, and is linked to increasing violence towards minorities. (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) What happens in online comment sections does impact the offline world and can put people in danger.
__label__Position	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist.  Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with.  But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged.  There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__Position	By warning users that hate speech will have consequences of being eliminated and blocked from the page and also making the system to monitor such users actively
__label__Position	Investing in green energy and upskilling the next generation for changes to come, such as AI
__label__Position	This can be done through lectures and youtube videos highlighting how moderators should approach those committing hate speech. It can also be done by teaching what hate speech itself actualy is, and how it affects people.
__label__Evidence	I agree that the hate speech perhaps should not be entirely removed. Sometimes a society has to confront its own ugliness/hatred head on, and removing it might do more harm than good (ie making commenters feel persecuted, perhaps making them even more hateful or violent). I also agree that still being able to access the newspaper might help change their minds.

__label__Position	Check this out https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Position	I think that the newspaper websites should keep reader comments but ensure that people are able to comply to having their opinions factually and intuitively backed up to ensure that they do not fall into hate speech. At the same time these comment spaces should be monitored to remove any comments which are hate speech and keep the comments strictly to free speech opinions about the topic of debate.
__label__Position	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__Position	Human spoiled the nature to a great extent and they have to face the consequences and should avoid doing more harm to the environment any further. 
__label__Position	preventing certain words being able to be used, filtering words
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	A documentation that I find interesting is available at the following link: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf
__label__Position	Comment sections are useful and needed, but there should be some monitoring and regulations in place to ensure that hateful comments are reduced.  A reporting system and a list of banned words would help, as would a system where moderators could approve or deny posts containing images. Reported comments, once reviewed, could be completely deleted or quarantined depending on the severity of the post in question.  In some case, quarantining posts to be hidden unless unhidden by individual users could allow the flow of posts to be followed and understood within the context of a conversation. This is a similar system to what is already in place in social media platforms such as Facebook and Reddit.
__label__Position	"We need people who actually fully understand how the ordinary person  feels, rather than the, "" them and us"" scenario"
__label__Position	have moderators and also have a rating system so people who comment alot and are safe and seen as realible people can be given access to report post which will then be hidden untill a mod can read and make a finale descion of the post.
__label__Position	I consider it important to allow debate to be open, there must be a better way to reduce or eliminate hate from comment space than getting rid of them. Doing so would allow no one to question opinion pieces they didn't agree with.
__label__Evidence	Just remove comment ability
__label__Evidence	I think that their needs to be some sort of compulsory education for UK citizens to understand what sort of international instability our UK government contributes to before we make blanket statements about stopping asylum seekers and refugees from entering the country! 
__label__Position	Key factors include ethical point of intervention along with just mere word filtering. Because sometime the message that was thought to be sent across might be pure but because of wrong choices of words, it can get filtered out.

__label__Position	I think that generally speaking, climate change can be corrected for the future. But we need big corporations to be on board, and the federal government to start mandating it.
__label__Evidence	hate speech will be reduced
__label__Position	Also another thought is I am wondering if Newspaper websites are the best place for discussions and comments, after all they are not government or public services, they are companies at the end of the day trying to sell newspapers or subscriptions to their services which increases their profits which it pays to their shareholders. Would a forum type website (like Reddit, or Quora, or maybe something new) be a much better location for these discussions, and by shifting the location to somewhere like this comments and media can be moderated and if anything breaks their rules posts can be removed before it becomes visible?
__label__Evidence	I tend to think that the government subsidizes too much already 
__label__Position	report anyone as soon as it is seen so they can be dealt with and removed.

__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites may remove comment areas if they wish. Having moderators or allowing only subscribed comments are also options that may work. They just have to be careful on who decides what is hate speech and what is fair comment.
__label__Position	I agree with this article about fining large social media companies if they fail to reduce the volume of abusive content on their platform. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ This gives the company a clear incentive to build technology that reduces this unsociable behaviour on an inherently social platform
__label__Evidence	can help educate
__label__Evidence	yes people will become dumber because they will train their brains power less 
__label__Position	Seems like counter-speech is also a good technique to integrate into a moderating system. I still believe the hate comments themselves should not be made public, but could maybe been shown as a blocked comment due to hate speech, with the counter-speech available to view for anyone, or it could simply be sent to the poster after removing their comment in order to give them a chance to reflect. https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1877a1a6-35c9-4355-9270-bba5a521639f
__label__Evidence	This is a great solution
__label__Evidence	That's not true, there are millions of platforms to hold conversation about news articles without talking directly under them. Everything they right is open to public scrutiny.
__label__Evidence	removing certain words would definitely prevent people from purposely stirring up hatred through the comment speech
__label__Evidence	You may argue that it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police their comment sections. Having said that, perhaps the relevant question you should be asking is whether it is in their best interests to do so. That is, even if it's not their moral obligation, it may STILL be in their financial and functional best interest to do so. The prevalence and salience of hate speech may signal to audiences that the newspaper tolerates (at best) and endorses (at worst) the hateful commentary appearing in their comment section. How do you think this would impact the bottom-line of the bottom line of said newspaper company? I would argue: Not well. And how do you think this would impact the ability of said newspaper to reach future audiences? I would argue: Not well. Individuals disgusted by the appearance of hate speech may be at an increased probability of avoiding said newspaper website in the future on moral grounds. Consider, for example, individuals who boycott Nestle for ethical reasons.

__label__Position	https://www.prio.org/publications/12392 According to Katrine Fangen and Carina Riborg, people who wrote hate speech comments on the newspapers were people who thought themselves as knowladgeable, so they will go on promoting hatred and spreading their ideas even if we eliminate the section of comments: we have to work on the root of the problem, which is education.
__label__Evidence	bit over stated
__label__Position	I agree with FransescoT online forums can be a wonderful community but hate speech with faceless people can ruin it. If you want to comment there should be some accountability.

__label__Position	The key issues that are important to me in terms of deciding who to vote for are the crime, the economy, the state of the environment and ensuring that taxation is fairly distributed.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__Position	https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/ The article linked here shows the outcome for many outlets who faced the issue of hate spech in their comment sections. One who disabled the section turned it back on eventually. And a leading newspaper actually invested in the comment sections, and provides the ability for readers & staffers to 'spotlight' top comments. This enhances my position that comment sections should not be removed and instead moderated and positive discussion allowed.
__label__Evidence	Having a timed ban is a good way to discourage hate speech, teaching people to reconsider their language and helping to moderate the tone of the comment section without permanently banning people from the discussion.
__label__Position	https://www.prio.org/publications/12392
__label__Evidence	I would agree, but this article (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0163443712472089?casa_token=FJm_UB0wIqEAAAAA%3ALr9dI-lrHJemMa9XgBVkx8tCkSQUSUAg14owxExDkpThv0tpIu6LJySR_p7EJ_lPqQbiATTxEfULs7k) states that filtering racism doesn't really stop racism, it just encourages it to go elsewhere. Maybe it will protect sites that use it, but otherwise, people will still find racism online. And maybe that's not the responsibility of the news site, but I find it disheartening still.

__label__Position	There is no way to fully eliminate one or the other. The best option is moderation by well trained moderators.

__label__Evidence	More understanding

__label__Evidence	"It is hard to actually define the ""offensiveness"" of a statement. "
__label__Evidence	Yes, it time for a change, we need new ideas and action
__label__Evidence	Yes 100%
__label__Position	I think having moderators who check the comments and remove any that contain hate speech is the best way of reducing it.
__label__Evidence	Who deems whether criticism is valid or invalid in this situation? I guess there will always be conflicting opinions and ideas, but over policing of this may not be the solution to managing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	It will be difficult finding people who will remain unbiased on issues they feel strongly about.
__label__Position	It is important to put attention to the fact that comments should not be randomly and uncontrollably censored since every person has the right to freely express themselves (https://rm.coe.int/16800c170f). Current algorithms are effective, but not 100% flawless in detecting hate speech and therefore should be optimized and can be used as a tool to eliminate hate speech on newspaper websites (https://ieai.sot.tum.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Research-Brief_Intervening-Against-Online-Hate-Speech_April2022_FINAL.pdf).
__label__Position	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Maybe designing an algorithm which recognises the hate speech and removes it automatically. Basically, implementing AI in the app.
__label__Position	This United Nations Guide has a clear reference to what constitutes hate speech. I think it is important to remember that it is only hate speech when directed against individuals or groups of individuals.   https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Evidence	There is always going to be fake news, thats what sells. Hate speech is not the same as voicing an opinion.
__label__Position	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net. This would make more work for the newspapers but would only require one person to constantly monitor what is being submitted and only allow reasonable comments.
__label__Evidence	It needs more than money, it needs some serious reform
__label__Position	No, because the newspapers should only provide information and journalism, the hate speech should be condemned by the public, not censored by the newspaper
__label__Position	While it may be silencing people's freedom of speech I still think it is appropriate to remove hate speech. There are other ways to express opinions without attacking another person personally.
__label__Evidence	I think that people need to be able to post comments but not offend others so I think that it should be policed by the webiste or they need to consider AI to filter out bad comments
__label__Evidence	agree a real punishment.
__label__Position	We need to frame scientific information within broader narratives and values
__label__Position	There should be no comment section however a robust system with an ombudsman should be put in place. Most importantly articles should be fact based information and not opinion based speculation.
__label__Position	I think it is not the correct thing to do as it makes it a one sided interaction and bars further exploration of the topic. The solution in my view would be to have the posts read first by an appointed party before being approved to go live.
__label__Position	The NHS, cost of living, inflation
__label__Position	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__Evidence	I do agree that online hate speech may require different legislation than already exists
__label__Evidence	There are concerns about unintended consequences of new technologies
__label__Evidence	This would persuade people to think about the consequences of hate speech since they will have to take responsibility with people being able to identify them.
__label__Evidence	The government should build more houses, and give more money to the NHS

__label__Position	Cost of living, housing, women's rights
__label__Position	Most realistically, you ought to have comment spaces moderated while the article is ongoing and then lock them after a certain amount of time has passed - or when meaningful discussion naturally draws to close. That gives a balance between being able to like...actually keep an eye on what people are saying without having to monitor everything you put up constantly. On the same front, creating aggregate comment spaces for a specific topic rather than one for every article could also potentially reduce the amount of areas necessary to be moderated, and accordingly allow for a higher quality of moderation that could curb the impacts of these behaviours.
__label__Position	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__Position	Removing comment space from online articles doesn't avoid people commenting.  This article reflects on Canadian newspapers who have removed comment space but still posts its articles on Twitter & Facebook where people can comment - so hate speech can still be written.  Moderating it is the only way to prevent it. https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/25/is-it-really-a-good-idea-to-turn-for-news-websites-to-turn-off-comments

__label__Evidence	It is sunny now.
__label__Evidence	I agree with you on the fact the media controlling what we view can be untrustworthy and outright terrifying, however in the view of hate speech and affecting the health of authors and committed readers mentally factors in more greatly than this, in my personal opinion.
__label__Position	removing the comment space from newspapers is not a way, there should be a parallel monitor that filters comments as well as bots that flag comments  
__label__Position	It might work better if there is a clear process for other readers to be able to escalate or report comments that are offensive, incite hate or otherwise in breach of the code of conduct.
__label__Position	It's important that we remain a democratic society with acceptance of free speech, however it is a tricky balance between allowing free speech and the moderation of speech to prevent hate speech. I believe newspapers should be allowing comment sections, however it will be their responsibility to monitor this, and the social media website's responsibilities to monitor this on their platforms as well. How they choose to do this will depend on cost/staffing availability/bot technology, however it is an important action to take to prevent hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely agree
__label__Position	People who pass hate comments should be given time off the app to reflect or rather banned from making further comments under that specific post
__label__Position	Social media manipulation through AI 
__label__Position	Cost of housing and regulating rents in London
__label__Evidence	Yes, spending 7 hours in A&E is no joke, but where are the medical staff going to come from? How many doctors are in training? Who wants to be a GP etc. 
__label__Position	We need to improve communication and engagement with consumers
__label__Position	Be proud of heritage and stop saying sorry for everything in the past.  Be proud ofmthe UK
__label__Position	I believe the most appropriate action is to use a combination of computer algorithms and human moderation to monitor and remove hate language. It is important that this doesn't simply become censorship but should be focused on comments that are used to hurt, demean or offend others.
__label__Evidence	Algorithms aren't that sophisticated. They might miss stuff, or label as hate speech something that isn't
__label__Position	Taking an evidence based approach, it does seem that removing hate speech can reduce its effect, but it might drive its would be posters onto more extremeist online communities where they are able to reinforce their views. Thus it makes the views less acceptable, but reinforces and radicalises a small number. Thus, education and inclusivity of all- no matter their beliefs- has an important civic purpose.
__label__Position	Other issues include crime, the prison service, immigration and education
__label__Evidence	Newspapers have to be free to censor  but finding the balance between legitimate comment and hate speech is more difficult that it first appears.  We can have different thresholds of what we find acceptable in an open forum.
__label__Position	Immigration Crisis, Cost of Living
__label__Evidence	There's a lot more violence against men and boys so maybe that should be the focus 
__label__Position	Comments should be regulated, but comment space should not be removed.
__label__Evidence	This is true
__label__Position	There is still no right way to control and curb hate speech, and readers need to be educated about it. And while this work is done, the comment space should be removed to avoid creating yet another hate space.
__label__Evidence	when do we click next?
__label__Position	By blocking the accounts of people that use hateful speech and not allowing them to access all newspapers websites
__label__Evidence	We owe our future generation the responsibility of keeping the planet safe for them, this is a non-negotiable obligation.
__label__Position	As commenter DamienC mentioned, it's almost impossible to define Hate Speech without rigorous Academic insight and debate. It's possible that by having a comment section at all, you are saying 'I accept and allow any and all opinions be expressed here'
__label__Evidence	Yes I don't know why they can't just tell the truth! It's not like the UK public expect them to to everything but what's the point in making promises to win the election and then not keeping to any of their promises?
__label__Evidence	An improvement on this would be to have a flagged comment be reviewed by a moderator rather than just delete a comment altogether.
__label__Evidence	Removing the comments section won't make much difference as people just migrate to different platforms to continue posting hate speech, the EU setup a code of conduct for countering illegal hate speech, https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en, this has had an effect on hate speech online and is something that newspapers can be part of if they want to help stop hate speech being posted by users responding to online articles.

__label__Position	i think the comment section of any newspaper is very important and helps the newspaper understand how it's readers are feeling.   it shouldn't be a difficult task to find a way to reduce Hate within the comments.
__label__Evidence	the servers could store our info 
__label__Evidence	Newspapers do not want to face critism by removing comments column, unfair society
__label__Position	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__Evidence	Do you believe that people can actually be controlled. The audience will alway find a way to spread hate.
__label__Evidence	We will; eventually join the EU (or at least customs union/single market) albeit not for years.
__label__Evidence	It is difficult to determine what is considered hate speech as everyone has their own biases
__label__Evidence	Some people may set up fake details / profiles in order to still post the hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	True picture of peoples lives will be shared and discussed
__label__Evidence	I totally agree with this. Privatisation has been a huge mistake 
__label__Position	How about a government that looks after the majority and stops bending to breaking to point  for ta generation that is offended by air 
__label__Evidence	I overall agree. But, newspaper comment sections are very public and mainstream. Allowing hate speech on such places makes it seem less taboo, and more allowed. These aren't the kinds of ideas we want people to think are 'ok'.
__label__Evidence	Immigration is good for the economy  
__label__Evidence	Agreed - investment is a key word here. reducing homelessness reduces other pin ch points in places like healthcare etc.
__label__Position	Given stories or topics that comment on our social space,free speech should be communication that can express thoughts and opinions, debates on how we feel about any particular information.
__label__Position	I see that a lot wants to go the AI route. one or so are against it. Again, it is good to see the opinion of other people and how other people feel about an article, or news event. I do understand that there are people that abuse platforms for the sake of hate, but therefore I will agree with a NON bias panel that regulate the comments on a platform. AI is limited and we have seen on other platforms that it creates division when they start to mix in unwanted words or meddling with AI system to create a certain outcome. It is dangerous again and that is what is causing more hate, than a few that just use and abuse.
__label__Position	Improve civic education, especially for young people
__label__Position	This would be much more ethical
__label__Position	Readers should be allowed to share diffrent opinions but maybe the sytem or website should restrict certain vocabulary in the comment section.
__label__Evidence	Manpower intensive
__label__Position	Incidentally, I have already voted,  by post.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a symptom of a toxic society and education to people to respect opposing views is the way to go
__label__Position	"There could be a list of community guidelines that commenters would have to scroll through and check ""I agree"" or something similar before having access to the comment section. The community guidelines could include things like ""No personal attacks"" ""No racial slurs or profanity"" etc. It is important to remember that something is not automatically hate speech just because you are offended by it. Censoring all criticism and comments is not the answer, and neither is allowing a group of moderators to determine what is and what isn't hate speech. Community guidelines with clear outlines on what is and what isn't allowed is fair for all. Do not leave anything up to speculation."
__label__Evidence	Costly to the company to pay for dedicated moderators
__label__Position	Inconsistent application of planning policy and conservation guidance means that improvement proposals meet with widely different and unpredictable responses in addition to delays caused by the strained planning system. 
__label__Evidence	I disagree, try to read everyone's idea. Some are feasible and doable
__label__Position	You need stricter standards with moderators who act quickly to censor and analyse comments to remove those which cross boundaries.
__label__Evidence	But who is going to pay for all thee changes? Big business surely will not foot the bill and pour own government in the USA is in so much debt already that we are nearing an economic collapse
__label__Evidence	Little real difference in broader terms, doubt many people could tell theire policies apart
__label__Evidence	I agree, public debate is good.
__label__Position	It seems like there needs to be more emphasis on education before people get to the age of commenting on newspapers, if at this point people still don't understand what is and what is not hate speech, newspapers need to moderate comment sections by having a person or an algorithm flag comments that could be derogatory before they go live so that the conversation is not broken in the comment section. This allows for free speech while also trying to moderate and get rid of hate speech.
__label__Position	I think that as others have said we need to have comments sections as it gives a chance for people to point out different views and perhaps make corrections or point out exceptions. I hadnt thought about moderated comments sections before but it may be a good idea. Although there would need to be very clear guidelines on what constitutes hate speech I think or there might be the potential for something someone doesnt agree with to be incorrectely flagged
__label__Position	I care deeply about animal rights, so I'm evaluating each party's stance on animal welfare. This includes their positions on factory farming, animal testing, and wildlife protection.
__label__Evidence	newspapers write viewpoint without reproach
__label__Evidence	There should already be policies that hinder hate speech as it seems that the problem is escalating
__label__Position	As evidenced by this story the dangers in letting people comment without clear consequences is dire so I see the need for such debate https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/fake-dr-oz-poster-went-viral-twitter-fact-check-not-rcna46899
__label__Evidence	Removing readers comments removes the users freedom of speech which is a basic human right
__label__Evidence	It also may be neccesary to use the words, but in light of this would give a person a chance to think before they type, so to speak.
__label__Evidence	Which party you think would be best for that? 
__label__Evidence	What crisis?
__label__Evidence	Asking people to ignore it is not a solution
__label__Evidence	This will cause readers not to engage with the website  or newspapers
__label__Position	"Climate change is anyways is a hoax! 31,000 scientists reject global warming and say ""no convincing evidence"" that humans can or will cause global warming"
__label__Evidence	Europe has ceded leadership on the peace process to the US
__label__Evidence	You would hope!
__label__Evidence	*affecting
__label__Position	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this argument. It is important to balance the right to freedom of speech against the need to reduce hate speech.
__label__Position	I am not really happy with any of them but want Conservatives out all they have done is make a total shambles of everything !
__label__Position	Transport has also been a factor for me, especially fixing the state of the local roads.
__label__Position	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__Evidence	I think there are bigger fish to fry at the moment. 
__label__Position	Hate speech is something is completely unacceptable and should be eradicated by all means necessary however regulations are our best bet if we are to maintain freedom of speech at the same time.
__label__Evidence	i do get your point, some hate speech does get severe, which is what should be removed, i think some should be removed from root, and yes some topics need you to talk about them
__label__Position	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm
__label__Position	Arguments for:
__label__Position	testing
__label__Position	the cost of living crisis
__label__Position	i give up. this is unusable
__label__Evidence	"""Townscape ('amenity') and heritage concerns"" (Crispin Edwards)"
__label__Position	nationalise the water companies
__label__Position	I have been looking at various parties stances on the NHS and improving public services
__label__Position	People may not accept or have different ideas. There is no need for Hate speech and people dont know when or where is appropriated to use some of the terms, as well using punctuation which some times leads to different ways of speaking. we need to accept that we are different but all the same by the end.
__label__Evidence	agree - adverts are on everything now so being on BBC wont make much difference.
__label__Position	helping cost of living, preventing NHS privitisation, lowering austerity
__label__Evidence	I think some avenues are being made to increase LGBTQIA+ rights but perhaps not quick enough. Cost Of living has just got out of control and those costs aren't going to come down.  it will take a few years until peoples salaries catch up and prices have been stable for a while until the pinch lessens and I doubt any government will make a huge difference to this as their goal will be to keep inflation down. 
__label__Evidence	I gree because....
__label__Evidence	would be a very good start to flagging hateful people
__label__Position	There should be a policy that reflects upon hate speech. Such hateful comments should be deleted. The policy would have to have all hateful language covered. According to an article in Media engagement, research in mentioned countries was done and most people preferred that hateful speech comments should be deleted rather than profanity.
__label__Evidence	Thats a reasonable idea however, there needs to updates that automatically flag out inappropriate comments
__label__Evidence	I don't think joining the EU is really an option, we are too far down the line now. It shouldn't have happened but it did and we need to make the best of it now. 
__label__Position	International intervention is necessary to resolve the conflict
__label__Evidence	The environment and immigration are just as important as the economy and the NHS. The latter two have more far reaching consequences than the first two in many respects 
__label__Position	Affordable housing is another important issue
__label__Position	NHS and cost of living definitely
__label__Position	There should be some filters to remove bad comments
__label__Position	I dont like how the MPs argue like children when putting forward their ideas, it is quite embarrasing to watch
__label__Evidence	100% agree, Comment section is for everyone to present their opinion at all times
__label__Position	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__Evidence	I think the main things to ensure are: - Taking away the option for anonymous accounts - Having a screening process  - Giving users the ability to flag comments they think are innapropriate
__label__Position	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion 
__label__Position	having a screener in the background conrtolling everything thats coming in and also comment section
__label__Position	IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO READ NEWSPAPERS TO FEEL SAFE AND FREE WHEN THEY READ NEWSPAPERS.SOME WEBSITES OR NEWSPAPERS DONT ALLOW PEOPLE TO VOICE OUT THEIR FEELINGS OR COMMENTS AND THAT SHOULD BE IMPROVED.
__label__Position	improvung people's education
__label__Position	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view.  We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__Evidence	apparently the target group does not consider it like that: https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2004/05000/Immigrant_Suicide_Rates_as_a_Function_of.9.aspx
__label__Position	We could put a system in place that would automaticly delete and report any comments that contain hate speach.
__label__Evidence	Despite this there is woefully little work done to date on behaviour change and mobilisation within diverse groups, specifically in relation to ethnicity and disability. Work on behaviour change by Defra and others rarely looks at diversity beyond traditional income and class segmentation. Defra’s Framework and Strategy for Environmental Behaviour Change reports of over 100 pages barely mention ethnicity and make no references to disability or age. 
__label__Evidence	Agreed - it's technically simple to ensure that any website that allows public comments, can be linked to verified accounts. The government were thinking about doing this with adult sites - why not with sites that revel in hate speech.
__label__Evidence	We need to get out of the ECHR
__label__Evidence	fully agree
__label__Position	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.
__label__Position	housing, taxation, immigration
__label__Evidence	But too much freedom creates all the hate and toxicity we see in today's media
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	I agree with this comment sections can provide excellent reccomendations, for example: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/20/steely-dans-20-greatest-songs-ranked
__label__Position	after much thought on this subject i have come to the conclusion that most of the mainline papers are biased in their view then all comments should be shown,,,but i still cant work out how the foul language can be supressed
__label__Evidence	Agreed, but social housing has to be just as important because house prices for 1st timers will continue to rise if there's still a shortage. 
__label__Evidence	I like this becuase
__label__Position	I have decided not to vote at all.
__label__Position	Studies are indicating that comments on news articles can colour readers' perception of the article's content itself. By including unmoderated comment sections that can be full of hate speech and misinformation, journalists could actually be said to be reneging on their main responsibility -- which is not to elevate the speech of others, but to report on the news factually and objectively. https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/internet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality/371862/
__label__Position	Cost of living and indirect stealth taxes are a big issue
__label__Evidence	i agree, this would be useful as it can keep other comments
__label__Evidence	https://www.salon.com/2018/11/17/why-comments-sections-must-die/ While this article seems to agree with this point of view, I still feel that taking away spaces for discussion isn't the way to control hate speech.
__label__Evidence	It could lead to technical mistakes barring genuine contribution
__label__Evidence	It's lack of investment in training. We can't keep letting our country poach other people's trained doctors and nurses to save money.
__label__Evidence	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by having a team of moderators view the postings before publishing to make sure that there is no hate speech included.  Another way is for the readers to flag any hate speech as in appropriate for the moderators to review.
__label__Evidence	We will just end up importing oil and gas from other countries
__label__Position	Removing the comment section will not be effective since there will not be any interactions between readers.
__label__Position	have an approval for each comment?
__label__Position	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__Evidence	look into all that gas cars require before you are so quick to promote them. 
__label__Position	In my opinion all the comments should be screened before they are shared with the viewers
__label__Position	I dont think we can eliminate hate speech from newspaper headlines.  ONe idea could be do censor certain words, however, I think it is more important to educate people on their stance so they do no worry / are not concerned by others hateful words
__label__Position	Create an observatory of citizen engagement to study best practices
__label__Position	Veganism, while more ethical, good for the environment, and healthier diet, is not feasible for a great proportion of the human population
__label__Position	Human populations are approching carrying capacity on planet Earth.Without population control there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of climate cange.
__label__Evidence	By eliminating the entire comment secion you would be getting rid of the freedom of readers comments
__label__Position	MSM needs to be more accountable, along with social media sites. it's a very devisive world.
__label__Position	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__Evidence	I agree blocking all comments blocks free speech
__label__Evidence	I think this could be a good idea, but people will probably eventually find workarounds to avoid the censoring (as seen with spam bots using alternate characters in Youtube comments for example)
__label__Position	what reform has said as i agree with much of what farage says but a vote gets labour in
__label__Position	sorry caps lock on in error
__label__Evidence	I can understand the reason why that might remove some of the problem, but that argument is a bit like saying, some roads frequently experience traffic jams, so let's get rid of all the cars. What's more important is the effective moderation of hate speech - and also crucially to call out mistruths. Discussions are the starting point.
__label__Position	57b4e9d152a08d0001d1b9dc Care for the elderly, and NHS.
__label__Evidence	Different groups have different values and priorities that need to be addressed
__label__Position	The welfare and the cost of living should be addressed by the incoming government 
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can spread rapidly, and destroy lives. It is offensive, hurtful and can ruin people. I think this is a very bad opinion to take.
__label__Position	Some news sites still have active comment sections and have enabled a 'report comment' function for hate speech:
__label__Position	Comments should be vetted by publishers before posting on newspapers.to avoid hate speeches
__label__Position	Removing the comment space will take away the readers and users freedom of speech and the right to engage on the current affairs which give the newspaper ultimate power without any consequences.
__label__Evidence	Yes, a big improvement they could make is reducing the extremely long waiting times that we currently have.
__label__Evidence	depression and peer pressure should really call out to ones morals and values as a human being.
__label__Position	High levels of immigration, both legal and illegal. Rising toleration of crime
__label__Evidence	If the cancel that section then where will we be able to say what we feel. They will be robbing us of our free speech.
__label__Evidence	It is not possible to technically change the climate problem 
__label__Evidence	I agree while hate speech can be and should be monitored and removed immediately in order to reduce trauma on affected group and not to embolden other bigots. Platforms should still allow users to express opinions contrary to the creators. Peer review of reporting works well in these instances when someone goes too far - but this is also abused by with review bombing
__label__Evidence	Agree, it is a terrible situation, made worse by a right-wing Israeli govt.
__label__Position	Address the problem at hand (hate speech) without involving others who have nothing to do with it.
__label__Evidence	Yes, I think this is the right approach
__label__Evidence	Hate speech causes a lot of issues so it's nearly impossible to ignore. As much as we may have the right to freedom of speech, we also have the responsibility to engage responsibly.
__label__Position	I totally disagree, people are different
__label__Evidence	One research by the Sage suggest that we are in a world of algorithmic audiencing, whereby we are presented information in a way to increase engagement. This can be good and bad, but often the idea of engagement is most known when there is conflict. HEre's the link https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02683962211013358
__label__Position	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious  consiquences
__label__Position	As by this planet every year human population increased by year by year. so that human needs also may increased. we have to find another solution for this climate change else we have to find alternate reusable energy sources like green gas, electric bike etc. this is the only way to protect our planet from this climate chagne
__label__Evidence	Yes, this is important. Social care is the forgotten people that is so neglected even though they would have contributed to the economy
__label__Position	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__Position	Starmer will love zero hour contracts as he will get to pay everyone a load of benefits paid by me the tax payer.
__label__Position	I believe that comment sections should be allowed and should be monitored, but getting the manpower for that moderation is tricky
__label__Position	"I see two solutions to reduce hate speech from newspapers websites. First, websites can have moderators to filter what is considered as being ""hate speech"" and what's is a useful comment (giving an opinion about something without any hate, insults, etc.)"
__label__Position	"I believe we can fairly reduce hate speech by developing an algorithm to flag any potential ""hate words"" that may come up and then have an actaul member of staff thoroughly read the comment to determine if it was indeed hate speech or not. Also collecting indentification information can be crucial to hold the offenders responsible."
__label__Position	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__Evidence	It is truly dire, I think that's why we are here, to test it, not to talk about the election.
__label__Evidence	These comments are on their sites and it is their responsibility to control them. Some comments may be discriminating and therefore do not belong on the site
__label__Position	This is an article on why the UN tackle hate speech and its effects https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/why-tackle-hate-speech
__label__Position	There is much to be said for moderation strategies, as detailed here: https://www.medienanstalt-nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/materials_and_ordering_system/download/L202_Hateful-Commenting-Online.pdf
__label__Evidence	If we don’t have the skills to upgrade 3000 heritage buildings a year, what do the panelists suggest for up-skilling the wider construction industry for the existing “non-heritage” building stock? (Richard Lorch)
__label__Position	Europe should be the leader in resolving this conflict - it lies deep in Europe's democratic and human rights values to get involved and resolve this
__label__Evidence	In my opinion freedom of speech stops when it is directed hate towards a person or a group of people. Online platforms do not have to tolerate hate speech on their platforms.
__label__Position	we need to stop coment section
__label__Evidence	housing is a big one, landlords are getting away with everything. Charing insane prices for mouldy boxes  
__label__Position	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__Position	people have varying opinions about issues, and some do not consider their opinions as hate speech even if they are. reducing hate speech therefore will require websites to have a moderator who reads over comments and maybe a disclaimer for readers on what the newspaper considers hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I like the idea, however, most people don't have the time to go to other website to engage in conversation. This, if anything, will likely to reduce the amount of constructive conversation rather than increasing
__label__Position	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.
__label__Evidence	Arguably it could be in the newspaper's self-interest to police hate speech even if we say that it's not necessarily their responsibility, as moderation of comment sections has been shown to reduce perceptions of bias of the article itse lf (see e.g. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1356861)
__label__Evidence	I completely agree with you on this, cause this has been really heavy on my paying the heavy bills on housing   
__label__Evidence	I think adding chat bans for repeat offenders of hate speech could help.
__label__Position	I think that comments should be monitored and certain keywords should be flagged for review. This wouldn't catch everything, but might help a little.
__label__Evidence	Agreed - The party is represented by their candidates, and so many of them have vile political or personal  histories.
__label__Position	money for NHS and social care
__label__Position	the comment section should remain as it allows the readers to engage with the article. to reduce the risk of hate speech there should be restrictions and should be moderated to ensure the risk of hate speech is minimum
__label__Position	This would be a possibility, although even if people do not use their real names and details it is easy to track people online if they do not use a vpn (virtual private network) or tor (onion router). Connecting to a website reveals your ip address and a whole load of information which would be enough to track a person if a hate crime had been committed.
__label__Position	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__Evidence	Yes, I agree with this
__label__Position	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech.  Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire.  In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing.  On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen.  So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Evidence	Agree. I dont believe there would be one sophisticated enough to deal with this
__label__Evidence	No hate speech
__label__Evidence	If the best thing that can be said about Brexit is that is it not as bad as a global pandemic that killed millions that speaks volumes.
__label__Position	Lack of resources to create a more elaborate filtering system is a factor that can impact the process 
__label__Evidence	agreed amen to that 
__label__Position	Ask people to be respectful and back-up their opinions factually. The danger, of course, is attaching URLs or info that themselves propagate misinformation by presenting it as fact.
__label__Position	Taxes, housing, economy , illegal immigration
__label__Position	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__Position	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__Evidence	I believe having the ability to read through the comments of other is very important when making decisions. The fact that monitoring is weak across most platforms is the biggest issue.
__label__Position	make a difference but maybe it will
__label__Position	we could have people checking comments regularly and there be a helpline for people to inform of hate speech
__label__Position	Disallow comments. Discourse should take place in person, not in an anonymous forum. Discourse has evolved alongside human civilization, and anonymity has not been part of that until now. The conversations that happen online anonymously are not largely meaningful. It's self-defeating white noise, because it lacks social context.
__label__Evidence	It should not be made known to the public that certain comments have been deleted because it discourages participation. REMOVE THEM IN SECRET.
__label__Position	There is a strong need for newspapers to come up with strategies to manage this, as hate speech has been linked to increases in violence towards minorities, as seen here: https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Evidence	This will not stop hate speech
__label__Position	Those who want to encourage and participate in reasoned debate should be given ways to be encouraged to do so themselves, and to contribute more. Social support can encourage people to participate in a more positive manner (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-60830-006)
__label__Position	Newspapers should have a clear indication of what they consider hate speech to be and what the consequences of posting hate speech on the platform are. Most sites require you to have an account in order to able to comment and you have to submit some personal information to create that account. The newspaper site should monitor comments and remove hate comments from the site and if you have been noted to be a serial hate commenter then your personal information used to create the account can be used to contact you for re-education purposes. This however, should come with a disclaimer so that people can know what they are getting themselve into.
__label__Evidence	yes, but we need to motivate  their continuous participation.
__label__Evidence	If a man created a radio show, attacking the 'western' world, not actively engaging in war, terrorism or the sort, but speaking on it being a necessary evil... e.c.t. I for one would never call that and acceptable part of free spee ch and i know you wouldn't either
__label__Evidence	I agree that we need to rebuild our relationship with EU and vastly increase housebuilding. I think rejoining EU won't happen but realistically the single market instead (as much as I would wish we were still part of EU) 
__label__Position	As many of the opinions and comments iterate that it is not the responsibility of the media whether or not something is published with hate speech or not i disagree with this because if the person hadnt to have a platform to be heard and voice them self it would definitely go a little less noticed. That being said laws need to be passed on the extent of hate speech that they post as everyone is entitled to an opinion, however not everyone's opinion is from a good space or logical which we tend to dismiss the repercussions of the behavior of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	you cannot control people and there opinions.
__label__Position	Develop AI which is able to detect and delete hate speech automatically.
__label__Position	From my point of view, it is highly depends on the society and the behavarioul thoughts of people in that society. there are always disagree comments but as long as they are positive to writer and the subject itself. it can work. and if this hate can be spread in other thoughts and these comments are destructive so it can be limited, otherwise there is no need to removing this part.
__label__Evidence	they say they are honest but will find a big lie in that
__label__Evidence	information
__label__Position	economy, foreign policy, nhs
__label__Evidence	I agree with your suggestion
__label__Position	Not everyone agrees on what sustainable agriculture means and it is hard to take specific actions when there are so many ripple effects and unknown unknowns. Collaboration can possibly be improved with regular and open communication. 
__label__Evidence	Good luck with that one!
__label__Position	For people cant help themselves but say meaning and hurtful words towards other commentator and towards the newspaper itself, laminating will be a great choice and idea.
__label__Evidence	Agreed. And many of these potential solutions are also not successful at limiting harmful content (https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/the-facebook-upvote-and-downvote-experiment-is-a-bust.html). As long as the platform is comforming to the laws of the country then it should not have to introduce further measures to limit hate speech at the expense of preventing free and open discussion.
__label__Evidence	Whilst I agree, not when people are spewing hate and creating a hateful echo chamber.
__label__Evidence	This relies on people being impartial, which can never be certain. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/alternative-truths/201006/the-persistent-illusion-impartiality
__label__Evidence	I agree because the masses are suffering, due to bad economic practices by this current leadership and poor immigration policies 
__label__Evidence	Addressing concerns early can help prevent misinformation from taking hold
__label__Position	Yes agree make it easier to get gp appointment
__label__Evidence	I would love to think that we could screen every comment written about every article but it is simply not realistic. Removing the platform that gives power to hate comments is the best solution. I understand that people want free speech, but i do not see this idea manifesting seamlessly
__label__Position	One key issue has surrounded university fees e.g. tuition, as I am a student. However, I also believe a key issue is housing and job prospects for young people
__label__Position	getting the tories out
__label__Position	I still think a fliter needs to be added and then a mod can look over any comments that are flagged. This would likely stop people from leaving hate, if they know that their comments will not be posted/seen by anyone.
__label__Evidence	newspapers should remain impartial and hate speech leans on an opinion.
__label__Position	Algorithms for detecting hate speech are not yet as effective as human moderation, but I believe in combination with human moderation it can be a very useful tool to flag only potential comments for manual approval, rather than every comment. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152
__label__Position	By monitoring the comment section and holding people liable for their hateful speech.
__label__Evidence	infrastructure for EV is terrible 
__label__Evidence	Yes, people need to be more willing to kick up a stink 
__label__Evidence	the algorithm could be abused by users
__label__Evidence	This closes the possibility of healthy debate and non-hate speech.
__label__Position	Clear position on what parties are going to do
__label__Position	Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__Position	I dont agree that hate speech should be seen as free speech. We should be able to critisise and share resources and fact check, express options of disappointment and dislike but i dont think there should be such a large space online for people to fill it with hate, awful coments about other groups of people or individuals.
__label__Position	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__Evidence	Removing hate speech is not the same as removing the ability for everyone to present their opinion : https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Evidence	Rich are already leaving the UK it will be counterproductive 
__label__Position	Comments sections should be removed. They serve two purposes, echo chambers and arguing. Few people ever change their opinions based on the comments section of a news article. People who feel the need to announce their views on a public forum and demand everyone agree with them is a running trend. When someone doesn't agree and dares to voice an opposiing opinion the conversation can quickly devolve into name calling and personal insults. While this behavior doesn't always fall into the category of hate speech it is still toxic, damaging, and all too common.  https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Evidence	If your opinion degrades or harms an individual it is not needed. Removing it is the best option
__label__Position	i want to nationalise everything, we have horrible train fares, electricity bills, the water companies are dumping poo into every river they can fine,  
__label__Evidence	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Position	Proof that it's basically impossible to remove hate speech since comments and hate speech are pretty much synonymous: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Evidence	I totattluy disagree because.....
__label__Evidence	I like the idea of controversial opinions still being available to see other perspectives, but not being forced to see them if you don't want to.
__label__Evidence	Will still allow some comments which could be seen as offensive
__label__Evidence	There has to be fairness somewhere
__label__Evidence	Europe has historically been more involved in the region
__label__Evidence	unsustainable as people are dying
__label__Position	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__Position	yes so if they have something bad to say then they will be revield
__label__Position	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__Position	"""It is not so much about promoting upskilling as such, but about increasing demand so that  people will get incentive to start upskilling"" (Christopher Jofeh)"
__label__Evidence	This may negatively impact the public. As newspapers may publish news in a manner deceiving the truth and those who are not aware would believe lies.
__label__Evidence	If the newspapers are providing a platform on which abuse can be given, they do have a responsibility to prevent it. Abuse is in no way shape or form valid criticism.
__label__Evidence	The whole point of comment sections is so that people can provide their opinion on what they've seen/read, stopping this only minimizes debate and being able to view differing opinions. This then leads to break off groups choosing to use other platforms and thus having platforms with polar opinions which can be dangerous as people could be exposed to only one viewpoint
__label__Position	I think keeping the comment section would be a more democratic solution, but as it is often used to spread misinformation and hate speech I wonder if it's really that necessary. Do people find a lot of use into reading other people's comments to an article anyway, apart from the curiosity it creates in the reader? There are plenty of other options for people to be engaged online and express their opinions on topics they care about anyway.
__label__Position	The lack of faith I have in the ability of the political parties to fix the economy and look after people's welfare
__label__Position	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Position	even though the party has made mistakes, better conservatives than labour
__label__Evidence	This may be true to an extent, but it isn't a reason to give up on making positive change to create a better future.
__label__Evidence	True spirit of journalism
__label__Evidence	one con is this one
__label__Position	Websites could be held accountable and fined for any online harassment or hate speech online.
__label__Position	True
__label__Evidence	I agree that in removing hate speech there is a chance that we could be silencing valid criticism and curtailing freedom of speech. However, I do think that sometimes there can be a fine line between criticism and hate speech and I would much rather see valid criticism removed than to see hate speech spread.
__label__Position	The reader comments space should not be eliminated as it prevents the concept of freedom of speech, however there should be a regulations or filters to remove such comments that may be harmful to other or include hate speech.
__label__Position	economy and nhs
__label__Position	I stand with the abolition of online hate speech through the moderation of newspaper platforms, or the removal of the comment section altogether. If the latter is chosen, then comments should be allowed on third party platforms such as twitter and facebook... If the comments are identified as hate speech, it is then the third party platform's duty to deal with it.
__label__Evidence	To read a persons message would be an invasion of privacy
__label__Position	Refrigerants currently cause emissions throughout their life cycles, but 90 percent of emissions happen at disposal. 
__label__Position	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__Position	Although technology could help reduce hate speech, there are issues. For example, the program has to be written by a human who themselves may have a bias which influences what amounts to hate speech or not. This is raised in this artcle: https://deepsense.ai/artificial-intelligence-hate-speech/
__label__Position	Brexit, health care, economy and education
__label__Evidence	I believe those algorithms are not programmed to dealing with hate speech. Otherwise, social media would not be as toxic and emotionally as it is
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree but I can't see which party is likely to address that - they all toe the fashionable line
__label__Position	Yes that could also help
__label__Position	Furthermore, AI should be trusted in this case, as there has been development in the past two years on AI being able to detect and counteract hate speech, as shown on Facebook etc. (https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-advances-to-better-detect-hate-speech/).
__label__Position	Poor management during Covid (#Partygate while I buried relatives)
__label__Evidence	It is not possible to technically change the climate problem
__label__Evidence	the software might fail
__label__Evidence	Very much agree. Worth reading Four chancellors and a funeral.
__label__Position	there is no way to prevent hate speech totally, flagging comments for a moderator to deal with is probably the best way of preventing it
__label__Evidence	Knowing the rules, unfortunately, doesn't mean that people respect them. There's a lot of hate speech on Facebook and a lot of it goes unnoticed.
__label__Position	I don't have a hard stance on this because I do not feel knowledgeable enough about the issue to say for sure what my ideal solution would be. I agree it is a gigantic problem that needs to be met with urgency and importance by all of us. I don't know that we could reverse climate change, it seems most damage has been done, but I'm hopeful taking stronger actions now would at least help reverse some things, and prevent current issues from developing further. It's worth trying.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it can be very challenging. But what good is it to just give up. We have to at least try to make change, no matter how hard it can be. We just have to learn how to make the right types of changes. 
__label__Position	Inflation
__label__Position	I think we have to use some fact checking system that allows us to present thoughts and opinions, the system can block derogatory comments. This allows for a calm debate
__label__Position	next government to have a stance on the Israel/Palestine situation that reflects the UK.
__label__Evidence	I completely agree - I frequently don't comment because I expect that I will accidently unleash an off-topic argeument by people who just want to cause trouble.
__label__Evidence	No certificates should be needed to detect a hate comments, it comes to ethics and morality 
__label__Evidence	The current education system is outdated and doesn t address modern technological challenges
__label__Position	The entire nature of human rights standards and principles, as well as the ideals of tolerance, inclusiveness, and diversity, are all denied by hate speech. As a result, it may expose individuals who are the target to exclusion from social and economic opportunities, assault, and other forms of abuse. Expressions of hatred that go uncontrolled can potentially impair societal cohesiveness, peace, and development by creating the conditions for disputes, tensions, and widespread human rights abuses, including atrocity crimes. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/why-tackle-hate-speech
__label__Evidence	It is important to give everyone a point of view and allow them a space to voice it, within reason.
__label__Evidence	I personaly like the General Policy Recommendation from the Council of Europe to this topic: https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/recommendation-no.15
__label__Position	The Tories have taxed me to oblivion, and now Labour will go even harder. they can both go whistle.
__label__Evidence	While I agree with this statement, I would like to mention that public consultations have long been employed by governments to collect ideas and opinions. I believe to a certain extent the people are also to blame as they are so used to the conventional representative democracy while not trying to go beyond participating in elections.
__label__Position	Environmental policy; stance on electoral reform (move to a proportional system); integrity in politics; personality of local candidates
__label__Evidence	It's appalling. The side of the motorway coming back from the airport a few weeks ago was shocking. Couldn't see the grass on the side of the road in some areas there was that much! 
__label__Position	https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/the-comment-moderator-is-the-most-important-job-in-the#:~:text=Moderating%20content%20and%20comments%20is,cultural%20norms%20and%20acceptable%20behaviors.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__Position	Readers comments also give newspapers opportunity to improve, as some of the readers might also add things that they think the newspaper should improve on. taking the comment section out would also take away this opportunity from newspapers as they might not find out what their readers think. more education is need to reduce the impact of hate speech and also introducing technology that can deal with hate speech on the comment section.
__label__Evidence	It's true that eliminating the comments section might be helpful to prevent some ideas to spread more quickly.
__label__Position	introduce proportional representation in voting
__label__Position	Monitoring hate speech I think is the best way to initially deal with the problem. I think it is unfair to remove space for readers comments. People use these spaces to reassure their own decisions in some cases.
__label__Evidence	But to what extent should free speech be allowed? Should we as a society allow people that say hateful things against a particular ethnic group, race or gender all in the concept of 'its free speech, you can say whatever' I think that people are able to practice their rights but as soon as it starts becoming oppressive or infringing on another person's right, that is where we should start drawing a line.
__label__Position	I think everyone agrees here that comment regualtion is necessary.
__label__Position	The Leadership Conference Education Funds gives us ways to combat hate speech online, whether it be newspapers or social media to make sure that people's rights are protected. A link is given below, because there has been instances that hate speech not only started now but has been with us from eons, but people have found ways to deal with it. Here’s how you can help combat hate speech online and stop the spread of violent actions: Hold platforms accountable for hate speech. Report tweets, YouTube videos, Instagram posts, Facebook posts, and other speech that spreads hate to the platforms that are hosting it and demand action. If given the opportunity, be specific about what you find offensive and why. Raise awareness of the problem. Talk to your friends and family about why hate speech is not a problem just for the internet, but our societies and culture at large. https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=f872b161360cb19eJmltdHM9MTY2NjIyNDAwMCZpZ3VpZD0xNDgwZDNmYy03ZTI1LTYzYzMtMGZiZC1kZDNiN2ZkZDYyOTAmaW5zaWQ9NTQzNw&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=1480d3fc-7e25-63c3-0fbd-dd3b7fdd6290&psq=how+to+reduce+hate+speech+online&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9jaXZpbHJpZ2h0cy5vcmcvZWRmdW5kL3Jlc291cmNlL2NvbWJhdC1vbmxpbmUtaGF0ZS1zcGVlY2gvIzp-OnRleHQ9SGVyZSVFMiU4MCU5OXMlMjBob3clMjB5b3UlMjBjYW4lMjBoZWxwJTIwY29tYmF0JTIwaGF0ZSUyMHNwZWVjaCxoYXRlJTIwYWJvdXQlMjB0aGUlMjB3b3JzdCUyMGluc3RhbmNlcyUyMHlvdSUyMHNlZS4lMjA&ntb=1
__label__Evidence	Care must be taken not to accidentally block users
__label__Position	Active listening is crucial for building trust and reducing polarization
__label__Evidence	agree needs lots of focus
__label__Evidence	I agree to remove it and that opinions should be on the third party sites.
__label__Evidence	Social media can be used productively for learning and education
__label__Evidence	I somewhat agree with this.  I can't see what real changes there will be. 
__label__Position	Adaptation and fighting climate change often go hand in hand 
__label__Position	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__Position	Filter the comments so that any with known hate speech terms cant be posted. Make sure people sign in to make comments etc
__label__Position	Why people are unwilling to work and prefer to live off social benefits
__label__Position	But first and foremost you have to agree with what theyre promising
__label__Evidence	cost of living crisis my top priority  
__label__Position	To fairly reduce hate speech will be helping people from cyberbullying which may continue to increase the ideology of having media as a safe space
__label__Position	Statistics and trends are showing that climate change is irreversible(https: //www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99888903&t=1621870823276)
__label__Position	inept and greedy politicians
__label__Evidence	Persons will have to think before responding.
__label__Evidence	I want to hear everyones opinion
__label__Position	The way to avoid constant closure of the comments section is to use well-considered, human judgement by moderators back by explicit codes of conduct with examples. Some evidence of this approach:
__label__Evidence	could take a while
__label__Position	human mods and word filters
__label__Evidence	If we are so badly off then why won't the English parties let us have another referendum.  We are so much more worse off because of Brexit which Scotland didn't vote in favour of. 
__label__Evidence	I think that this is correct but mst places have a law or legal guideline as to what it considered hatespeech n that country
__label__Position	I find it hard to get into politics because I don't trust any of them
__label__Position	Medical sovereignty
__label__Evidence	I agree. In most cases people often react out of anger or disappointment, sometimes even without fully comprehending what is being said which I feel is the reason for some hate speech.
__label__Position	hoping that more schemes are introduced to help first time buyers
__label__Position	The only way to reduce hate speech is to create an algorithm that will delete any comments that displays hate speech
__label__Evidence	Yes, another way to only limit hate speech is to remove anonymity. Therefore, certain sites can require those to sign-up with their bio and this is verified by moderators. Someone may think twice about being 'hateful' if there are repercussions.
__label__Evidence	I don't think dated attitudes are the issue in the NHS so much as it all comes down to lack of resourcing. I've spoken to many people working there who also work in the private sector and they are absolutely capable of using modern technology. They just don't have access to it and overhauling system costs money. 
__label__Evidence	Comments would need to be approved before being posted.
__label__Position	The track record of the person vying for the post must be well examined before the voting process 
__label__Position	The use of the comments section is mainly to engage readers, but may be obsolete, and is there because it has always been there.....we should re evaluate its usefulness
__label__Position	NHS needs to be overhauled rather than patched up
__label__Position	The key issues for me are the Universal Credit Minimum Income Floor and having it removed to help working people better, also having more help for the homeless and having enough properties to house vulnerable people
__label__Evidence	Education is a great tool but essentially your website gives the solution without the steps. First people need to learn how to disarm the person they're debating with to educate them, which most people don't have the finesse to do. How do you change someones views when they're defensive from start to finish of your conversation?
__label__Evidence	the comment section can actually be a platform for bullying other people and hence it is a solution . removing it will limit publication of the hate speech
__label__Position	We must remove that comment before publishing and printing out
__label__Position	NHS, political representation, standards in public life, position on women's rights
__label__Evidence	Its not a easy thing to inconvenience people more than they already are.
__label__Position	Have individuals read posts prior to publicizing. This allows to filter out any comments that are inappropriate.
__label__Position	Do not allow comments, they are unnecessary.  Discussion should occur on other public forums.  We don't conduct discussions by writing on a newspaper and leaving it on a train for other poeple to write their comments on it.
__label__Position	Financial education to be taught in schools!!!!
__label__Evidence	It would reduce hate comments to the max.
__label__Position	We do not need to as it is free speech
__label__Position	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.
__label__Position	There can be some sort of system or AI that is able to scan comments for certain words associated with hate speech and if those words are identified, the comment is to be removed.
__label__Position	someone to check their posts before the article goes live, like a robot think
__label__Evidence	well said, this would help the economy a lot 
__label__Evidence	We have no problem where I live 
__label__Position	It is not fair if newspapers take away the comment space. I do not consider this to be fair choice in a supposed democratic society/
__label__Position	For me, the N.H.S. is a top issue. It is clearly not functioning well, and we are all suffering. It needs reform and that means not just throwing money at it. More doctors, nurses are needed.
__label__Evidence	But proper moderation is difficult to achieve.
__label__Position	im going to vote tory because rishi sunak posted a little dark age edit, thats what convinced me
__label__Evidence	Tasking whole units with not only moderation of hate speech but also tracking it and analysing it for trends is a huge additional workload for an already stretched sector. It sounds great, but likely unrealistic in terms of newspaper resources.
__label__Evidence	a lot to digest there.  I think just having a Government who don't just make stuff up would be a good starting point! 
__label__Evidence	I think that is a good way to go as it means posts can be checked before they are posted online so any posts that contain hate speech can be filtered out, whilst some may argue this goes against free speech and the right to free speech, I think when it comes to hate speech this is justified.
__label__Position	If this behaviour of eliminating comments is existing at a business decision level then it may have a limited effect on free speech as outlets are funded by consumers after all. If the state is taking an active role to legislate against these outlets then there may be a problem.
__label__Position	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful. We obviously can not control what people do but by filtering the comment section we can limit what people can and can not say.
__label__Evidence	Yes, I would be much more likely to post, read and respond to comments on a website location that is moderated and checked before posting
__label__Position	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__Position	Filters absolutely are needed in comments once again, and I agree that newspapers are needed to inform people
__label__Evidence	If you eliminate comments completely you both take away the right to free speech and inhibit the ability to have an open discussion about what constitutes hateful and offensive comments
__label__Position	If we start to moderate speech online too heavily, we will push more people to radicalisation in dark web groups
__label__Position	Some collaborative ways to promote sustainable agriculture practices include forming partnerships between farmers and researchers to implement innovative techniques, establishing farmer cooperatives for collective knowledge sharing and resource management
__label__Position	Have someone moderate the comment section and flag or remove comments that meet the criteria for hate speech. It minimises the hate speech problem while not restricting users from commenting their opinion or forcing them to conform their view to the post.
__label__Position	Equal rights and better quality of life
__label__Evidence	I think it is important for newspapers to provide a platform for people to express and discuss their opinions. Being able to hear other peoples' opinions is an important part of educating oneself, so completely eliminating a comment section seems unprogressive.
__label__Position	protecting welfare of poorest
__label__Evidence	Agree. Every time a government stays in power for more than a decade, it loses touch with reality.
__label__Evidence	It is a nice explanation
__label__Position	Yes I was reading a little about a few starting points to combat the hate speech and it was a good resource to help us move forward in reducing the impact hate speech has. You can find it on this link. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Evidence	How do you propose to address the root causes?
__label__Evidence	Less moderation and legal issues
__label__Position	Taxes, cost of living, education
__label__Position	Comments can be vetted and reviewed for key words that might be labelled as hate speech.
__label__Position	The NHS is suffering, one of the few issues that are important to me is how the government will address the issues concerning NHS.
__label__Position	Have set rules on what users can comment on regarding certain topics. If the user breaks those rules there should be consequences.
__label__Position	bring in legislation to ensure that companies link their top earners pay to that of the lowest earners eg they can't be paid more  than ?x the pay  of the lowest earner
__label__Position	When will the government pension shceme be scrapped?
__label__Position	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__Position	No, becuase the people have the right to express their thoughts  
__label__Evidence	Hate speech must be controlled in some how.
__label__Evidence	Taking away hate speech may not allow the audience to actually continue to express any opinions at all
__label__Evidence	"I used to moderate a forum. The administrator set up various parameters for keyword triggers. There would be a lot of spurious reports due to poor spelling or grammar use - for example you would get a post flagged up for mentioning the word ""hoe"" however from the entire sentence it was clear they actually mistyped ""home"" - the system is not foolproof."
__label__Evidence	Current power holders have no incentive to change the system
__label__Position	The similarilty between Labour and Conservative 
__label__Position	quality of life , the immigration policy , social care, to geet the party out who has made our country the laughing stock of many others , our respect has gone, quality of life, social care, enviromental issues and the immigration poicy
__label__Evidence	To understand how this can be managed in order that peoples opinionsare taken into account and not dismissed.
__label__Position	I merely believe that if steps are taken we can combat fake news and hate speech responsibly.
__label__Evidence	is half an hour would be sufficient for that? it might take more time for people to get together into groups 
__label__Position	We're forgetting that on some platforms, the person who made a post on social media can chose to disable the comment section. this could be a solution for newspaper websites if their comments are attacked by trolls.
__label__Evidence	How will all the content be monitored.
__label__Evidence	The biggest problem that there is
__label__Evidence	I think comments provide additional context and a barometer for the reception of the article. Removing comments completely would be a shame!
__label__Evidence	Education alone may not be sufficient to address complex societal challenges
__label__Evidence	This could be considered less democratic and biased only showing positive comments. https://www.proquest.com/openview/87a0114d041605296b4dd4dd32634b4d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750
__label__Evidence	This might negatively affect the person/ people in the articles.
__label__Evidence	We need people in the UK to actually be helped back into work to realise they can earn more money by working than on benefits. There are enough people to make a difference without so many immigrants.
__label__Evidence	This raises several questions: • Does exclusion matter? • Is investing time and resources in creating a genuinely inclusive environmental sector well spent and why? • How can this transition to an inclusive sector best be brought about?
__label__Position	I believe in democracy, equality and freedom of speech however I do not believe in hate speech therefore I believe that newspaper websites should keep the original essence of the newspaper and not a comment section as other newspaper websites with comment section seem to spread fake news. I think that since we live in a social media world, hence newspaper websites can post their article on them so that people can share their views on the article.
__label__Position	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__Position	Possible solution could be to create users with membership rankings and incentives for positive behaviours.
__label__Evidence	Human-based detection exists for certain content, but represents a really high cost for companies. 
__label__Position	If the information is accurate and the facts are accurate.
__label__Position	tackling immigration, safe spaces for biological women, policing, wokery, left wing bias in all mainstream media and tv.
__label__Position	MAYBE JUST REMOOVE SOME PARTS THAT PEOPLE DONT NEED TO SEE AND ADD IT THERE IN ITS PLACE
__label__Position	I can understand this argument, it would solve a lot of problems, but not all comments that people make are hate speech. Eliminating the space means that other helpful comments that generate ideas are removed too.
__label__Position	the cost of living, the NHS, childcare and the Israel/Gaza war
__label__Position	The arrogance of the Conservatives
__label__Position	I think comments should be approved by someone before going live.
__label__Position	There can never be any one side to a story and it is important for the readers of an article to engage on it,so with that said, the comment space shouldn't be eliminated but a robot can be created to monitor the readers comments, flagging hate speech, racism and cyber bulling. the punishment should be revoking those readers subscription to the newspaper for a certain period as the brand itself wouldn't want to want to be associated with such
__label__Evidence	The requirement of a phone number is a reasonable one, but might restrict participation (i.e. there will be people who are unable or unwilling to give their phone number just to comment on a newspaper website). An alternative approach could be to enforce a 'waiting time' from account creation to the ability to post comments? This would prevent repeat offenders from simply creating new accounts after they were banned
__label__Evidence	Most readers don't know that comments are turned off https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Position	I really like this.  It might be a costly exercise for newspapers and media companies to employ moderators, but the reduction in comments sections without oversight would be no bad thing.
__label__Position	First, it would be important to define what hate speech is so that readers that want to post comments have a chance to self-modify their posts. Secondly, having a filter that will automatically block posts that contain proscribed words could also help to reduce the amount of hate speech featured in comments sections.
__label__Evidence	Not so much swearing and negativity.
__label__Evidence	AGreed
__label__Position	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__Evidence	Sometimes being truthful can mean being harsh, but for the greater good.
__label__Position	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments and content management.
__label__Position	Taking away the comments section would feel like an enfringement on everyones right to freedom of speech. Rather a limitation of what can  be said sounds better. Guidelines are made for that
__label__Position	by just making the section smaller and have trasparency with dooing so
__label__Position	I think news outlets should not encourage hate comments, which some do (e.g. MailOnline) by their headlines and stories they choose to run and how they write them. I also think there should be a screening process for anyone who wants to post a comment.
__label__Evidence	waiting lists for housing in my area are crazy 
__label__Position	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__Position	Yess, thats totally correct. In order to reduce hate speeches there shoyld not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	yes it is a mess but it has to be sorted out

__label__Evidence	This is correct, as blocking free speech altogether leads us into a very different type of society. It is a tricky dilemma, how to allow free speech but prevent hate speech, but one that does need attention and ideas
__label__Evidence	There has to be a way that people can comment and respond especially if an article is not accurate. I feel that monitoring is a better answer to this problem, although also time consuming.
__label__Evidence	Robots cannot feel empathy or anything to distinguish between a regular comment and a comment containing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Who will moderate it? Can local papers afford to hire people to moderate every comment?

__label__Position	There will always be haters - it is human nature. To eliminate hate speech you would have to eliminate the comments space. If newspapers want to keep the comments space, then constant moderation would be necessary.

__label__Evidence	The poorest communities in the UK are amongst the most negatively affected by the causes and consequences of climate change. We need different and low-carbon ways to develop prosperity and meet the aspirations of these communities as part of a strategy to tackle poverty and inequality.  It will be essential that those suffering the effects of poverty and those who represent their interests are involved in this work.

__label__Evidence	There is nothing wrong with a healthy discussion from opposing sides of an argument. The only issue is when people are posting hate speech. What is hate speech needs to be clearly understood https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Position	completely agree with this allison. However, I would feel safer knowing comments are being moderated and hate speech is being taken serious even if this means a few critical comments which don't completely fit the hate speech category are taken down. I would silence a few but i trust moderators would choose to only get rid of those comments that are genuinely harmful
__label__Evidence	Requiring people to give a lot of information about themselves in order to give their opinion online is NOT a direction we should be going in. Moderators are fine; requiring people to dox themselves so they can be educated is not it.
__label__Evidence	I think some people are out there to hurt so know they're commenting hateful things but know they can get away with it because there are no consequences.
__label__Position	We should define what hate speech is, how people see hate speech, when it is considered hate speech. If we can answer these questions, we may be able to reduce hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Comment section is a space where we learn from each other, and we can disagree but need to eliminate hate speech.

__label__Position	I believe that comment space does enhance social participation and should not be completely removed.  I do think that it should be regulated by moderators following a clear set of standards.  It might also help to make people more accountable for what they have written, by having to supply some personal details before commenting.

A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions.

__label__Evidence	I agree, newspapers should remain impartial as much as possibe and outsource the management to a third party that most consumers of media can agree on to form that structure for defining and removing comments.

__label__Evidence	true there are valid criticism that are necessary
__label__Position	I feel that climate change is happening on some level, but question how much of it is due to a natural cycle and how much to human activity.    When it comes to stopping pollution and protecting the earth, I am on board.   Where I draw the line is using climate change as a platform to implement socialist policies and take excessive freedoms from people.
__label__Position	Commenters with a history of hate speech should be blocked from commenting
__label__Position	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__Position	Monitoring hate speech can become a very tedious process if it is left for humans to do. Sifting through hundreds, if not thousands of comments is a very time consuming process. Then to add to that, some moderators may or may not agree that a certain comment needs to be moderated.
__label__Evidence	I don't understand why not.  Even if it's for a local independent who you think will be good for your area. 
__label__Evidence	People are using hate speech in non sensitive articles too.
__label__Evidence	but they say inflation is coming down, I don't feel it!
__label__Evidence	I like this idea, I hope everyone is able to be respectful to each other but unfortunately this is not always the case
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__Position	I don't believe that we can reverse the climate change that we have already done at this point, because we're too far gone. That said, I think that we do have the ability to at least slow it down or change the current course as to not do any more damage.  
__label__Position	I don't believe eliminating space for readers comments is a fair practice. People should be free to express their opinion. Hate speech can be a problem. However, simply turning off comments is not going to eliminate hatred; it will only sweep the problem under the carpet. In fact, allowing people to vent in the comment sections can serve as an escape valve for the negative emotions.
__label__Evidence	100% agree
__label__Evidence	It is unfair to say you don't trust parties that have had no chance to prove themselves. The tories alone have been in charge for 14 years. Any of the other parties could offer more, its certainly worth a gamble at this point

__label__Position	European countries should recognize the State of Palestine
__label__Position	The Conservatives have to go 
__label__Position	The implementation of polices to regulate any form of discriminatory or hateful comments, while allowing space for readers to express opinions is necessary. As it is through uncensored opinions that conversations begins and transform into real issues. There definitely needs to be a 'blocking users' feature and censors on profanity. However, a very restricted comments section can cause misrepresented news websites to spread their biased perspective without being challenged by the public.
__label__Evidence	Agree with this. It's about getting the balance right to allow people to voice their opinions and add to the discussion without being hateful to others
__label__Position	I think that growing more trees can reverse the adverse effects of manmade climate change. Trees release fresh oxygen. Protecting the environment is the key to reversing the harmful effects of climate change. It is most important to preserve the natural environment and plant more trees.

__label__Position	labour will need to put up taxes and look to be hiding future plans

__label__Evidence	You are aware that ethnic minorities can be racist?
__label__Position	Trans rights and treatment of minority groups (Labour's treatment of Dianne Abbott etc.)
__label__Position	By enforcing moderation and review process to filter the views and opinions reflected in the newspaper wesbites, we are adding subjective filteration into the process which is not creating healthy environment for the freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I feel something really needs to be done to help the NHS as well, it's supposed to be the pride of the nation
__label__Position	who can tackle the cost of living crisis
__label__Position	I think online newspaper shouldn't remove the comment space from their platform. I think everyone should follow rules do reduce hate speech. Every comment should be moderae.
__label__Position	i do not believe that speech should be restricted just like that. what constitues as hate speech? and what constitues as fair criticism? i believe the people today have become very sensitive and cannot critically think because of censorship of important thoughts and ideas. if we dont censor oversexualisation and crude language, why should we censor criticism? i believe hate speech which incites harm and calls for negativity flat out should be what is flagged by the administrators or moderators and the people should vote on it, not just one person.
__label__Position	I think most people are reasonable and will consider others' feelings and stand points before they post, at least to some extent. The people we need to worry about are those who just post their opinions without any thought or care for others who may be offended or even attacked by their post. These people are very hard to control as they want to be entitled to their 'freedom of speech', regardless of who it may offend or upset.  On the other hand, restricting what people want to say is dodgy territory and we run the risk of entering into murky waters of what can be controlled by 'the powers that be'. If we let them control what we say, we're only half a step away from letting them control what we do...which arguably we already let them do in 2020 with the covid lockdowns etc.  On reflection I therefore think that newspapers should have filters set up in their comments sections that automatically block hate speech (this can be pre-identified words and phrases). This way, people wanting to cause trouble by posting hate speech won't be able to do so on the newspapers' websites. I also agree with previous commenters who have suggested making the comments section a little harder to find, which will put off some of the troublemakers and also hide any sensitive comments from those not wishing to read any of the comments.  I've been on a bit of a ramble here but I hope this all makes sense!
__label__Position	affordable housing, current cost of living crisis, education
__label__Position	Hate speech is for sure an issue on newspaper/journalism websites. I don't think that removing the comment section is the way to go, however, there does need to be some type of moderation to make sure that people still feel safe and comfortable getting the news. A moderation team or algorithm seems okay, but will also require a lot of resources to get set up. Another option could be community moderation, where people can flag and report comments if they are inappropriate. Again, this is difficult to implement fully, because people will abuse the function or otherwise find ways around it. We should also consider what we as individuals can do - can we help to educate people around us so that they don't spread hate speech around?
__label__Position	nationalisation seems a good idea, because right now the government is relying on our taxes.  If the profits go to the governent then they can drop the taxes.
__label__Position	tax. education and NHS services
__label__Evidence	would definitely need a team of moderators
__label__Evidence	Recent congressional hearings have highlighted the chasm between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler convened a hearing in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, saying the internet has aided white nationalism’s international proliferation. “The President’s rhetoric fans the flames with language that—whether intentional or not—may motivate and embolden white supremacist movements,” he said, a charge Republicans on the panel disputed. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Ted Cruz, held a nearly simultaneous hearing in which he alleged that major social media companies’ rules disproportionately censor conservative speech, threatening the platforms with federal regulation. Democrats on that panel said Republicans seek to weaken policies dealing with hate speech and disinformation that instead ought to be strengthened.
__label__Position	you wanna control people thoughts???
__label__Evidence	Free speech
__label__Evidence	I really hope whoever gets in stops these boats 
__label__Position	Sorry, I intended to add to the above Guardian-article-link, that it surprised me because it suggested that, to some extent - and in some forums - online commenting is not anonymous.  I was quite heartened to read that a few of those commenters interviewed had actually been temporarily banned at one time or another, for some comment they made, and that actually this had greatly affected them.  Possibly this is just the attitude of this people who actually take responsibility for their own comments and are willing to be identified, though.  I don't imagine that the people who make death threats or rape threats are quite so distressed by the prospect of being thrown out of a forum.
__label__Position	Upon reflection and a comment that PeterD made, I've re-considered my stance slightly. A good point has been made that journalistic integrity should sometimes be challenged and that becomes difficult when comment sections are removed. You could argue that feedback forms are one way of allowing work to be challenged but these are anonymous and thus impossible to regulate
__label__Position	my opinion on this matter is that newspaper agencies must hire website monitors that will also be responsible for making sure that no hate speech is spread on the platforms
__label__Evidence	Yes they are just in it for what they can get out of it
__label__Evidence	Good that you are taking this seriously 
__label__Evidence	The comments need to hidden from the public comments and get approved to be viewed in online newspaper website.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech should be preserved but it had to be regulated. I think comments should definitely be moderated by people. Banning words or using an algorithm has many flaws such as misuse.
__label__Position	Moderation seems to be a popular idea that generally I agree with. That being said I also think there should be a way to report comments that contain hate speech in order to streamline the moderation process and ensure problematic comments and commenters are addressed in a timely manner.
__label__Evidence	Yes, freedom of speech is very important in this day and age.
__label__Position	"We shouldn't eliminate comment sections entirely as that comes with its own repercussions but there should be some form of at least minimal moderation available on these sites to ensure that certain topics don't then become completely overwhelmed with negative/hate-filled opinions - as this blog suggests ""Comment moderation is essential to grow a digital community. Without comment moderation, you open your community to abuse, profanity and spam—and turn prospective fans and customers away. It’s your responsibility to ensure your brand environment is safe and inviting to your audience."" (https://www.smartmoderation.com/the-quick-and-easy-guide-to-comment-moderation)"
__label__Evidence	Exactly. Just ignore the hate speech. Like in real life you just ignore the bullies
__label__Evidence	I agree with removing comments but not for this reason
__label__Position	Hate speech is a topic that has many sides. it depends on a person what they see as hate speech. I can see an opinion on a subject while another person will feel attacked by that opinion. This is a thin red line that I do think AI's created in the world with trying to please everybody. In the end, the opinion of a person is not seen as an opinion anymore, but rather hate speech. My suggestion would be for all people to respect each others opinion, like we use to and not take everything so personal now a days. If the shoe fits, wear it. If it does not effect you, don't comment. And NEVER be personal in your opinion. Live and let live again in the world is what is needed.
__label__Evidence	NHS privatisation would be a huge blunder...fund it properly like they promised!! 
__label__Evidence	some mistook freedom of speech for spreading the hate speech. Some root causes of hate speech originate from child hood traumas and are deep, i do not think that we may be able to tackle those just for the comment section hate speech.
__label__Position	im also concerned about the small boats coming in. 
__label__Position	Hate speech is a problem that has let some people to even take their lives. finding a way to eliminate it is a good idea but eliminating the comment section does not sound to be a good idea as every story gets interesting with interaction. the comment section brings life to a story so we cannot afford not to have it. I would suggest filtering the comments and blocking those with hate speech.
__label__Evidence	well said.
__label__Position	How to tackle the horrendous state of the NHS, support for every day families given the cost of living it still an ongoing issue.
__label__Evidence	I do not agree with this, to solve this issue, there should be moderators to monitor the comments before they are posted
__label__Evidence	also, less caddle means less incentives for deforestation 
__label__Position	There have to a way to remove hate speech before it could reach the comment space, the comment space is important because some people will help to improve the online newspaper
__label__Position	I definitely think newspapers should remove the comment space because it encourages trolls and hate speech
__label__Position	I think that the space should be monitored and should state on top of the space that hate speech is not acceptable and will be removed.
__label__Position	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Evidence	This still poses an issue with what people think is acceptable.  You run the risk of people joining in as opposed to call it out.
__label__Evidence	They've both had a chance to prove themselves - they've both had a chance to show consistency over policies. Neither have. 
__label__Evidence	Surely this would depend on the opinions and ideas of the moderators in some cases unless they followed some standards such as what the UN outline here on hate speech... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Position	NHS and help low earners
__label__Evidence	"In my country, and I have no doubt in many others, incitement to hatred is punishable by law. So, when you write that it is not the problem of newspapers or websites, I can only be astonished. It is too easy to start a controversy that may have consequences and to defend it by saying: ""we have started a discussion, the outcome is not our responsibility, we wash our hands of it""."
__label__Position	Go through and censor out certain words
__label__Position	I think it would be hard to use moderators due to the sheer volume of comments.  How could this be patrolled 24-7?
__label__Evidence	Agree on the NHS, time to think of new models rather than just pouring more money into it
__label__Evidence	How will we know how the public feels about about  a certain topic if they cant even give their opinions? I do not think this is fair. At least appropriate measures can be taken in order to stop hate speech.
__label__Position	I think newspapers websites should have an online system  that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I don't think this would a particularly helpful thing to do. Comment sections help readers make their contribution(s) to the discourse. Perhaps the development of algorithms that work through the comments to identify what's inappropriate and remove it.
__label__Evidence	A good point, a lot of memes may be seen as offensive and may be flagged as such. There is the man I saw on the news who made a video for YouTube and made his dog do an offensive stance as a joke and ended up with prison time, it depends on how far a joke could go and the stance of those seeing the joke. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-43478925
__label__Position	Hate speech cannot be reduced unless we completely prohibit online discussion which is totalitarian. We need comments sections that allow freedom of speech but with moderation for offensive or derogatory words and phrases.
__label__Position	From what I read, a lot of you agree that the freedom to write comments is important but that there need to be rules to ensure there is no hate speech. If a newspaper has a comments section then they must employ moderators to police those comments sections and ensure that everyone makes their points within etiquette rules.
__label__Position	comments can be screened before they are posted live on the platform so they can be filtered.
__label__Position	Scottish Independence
__label__Evidence	that's right, comments actually can give a lot useful information but also give all the wrong idea about particular article.
__label__Position	Which MP do you most want to see have a Portillo moment? Mogg would be my first choice. 
__label__Evidence	We need some approaches to actually preventing hate speech and putting an end to it.
__label__Evidence	Yes, reduce waiting lists, get people help they need and in turn seen improvements in policing, homlessness, unemployement etc.  
__label__Evidence	honestly, what do you think you are adding to the discourse?
__label__Evidence	"In which case it may be better to actually *remove* the comments altogether, than overwrite them with the ""this comment was removed due to hate speech policy"" or ""this comment was flagged as inappropriate""."
__label__Evidence	In an ideal world perhaps, but how would you recognise 'hate speech' and police this in practical terms without infringing civil liberties and free speech. AI offers one avenue, but many challenges remain and there are many risks with this approach: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152
__label__Position	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__Evidence	Less hate speech
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech does exist, and every user has the right to say what they wish. Where is the line drawn in regard to this discriminatory content?
__label__Evidence	The establishment elites will never stop the truth, they don't want to be criticised in any way. If truth is banned in online media, people will find another way of discussing truth, like samizdat in Soviet Union
__label__Position	I'm pro taking action. It doesn't have to be a big action, but if we all play our parts, we can make even small changes to help offset the situation.
__label__Evidence	I tend to think that the government subsidizes too much already
__label__Position	Balancing the right to free speech and the illegality of hate speech is a complex task. The best way to do it would be to have individuals check newspaper websites comments and decide themselves based off of existing statutory and common law. However, this is unlikely to be able to be done due to the manpower necessary and as such an AI which can do this would be needed.
__label__Position	stop new oil and gas licences and ban lobbying by fossil fuel interests
__label__Position	hate speech is inevitable
__label__Position	Conservation of resources may end up where it's eventually undone by someone who takes them, as nature doesnt like a void.So climate change can be neutral at best and getting worse at worst with this principle. 
__label__Evidence	I absolutely agree. It's newspapers responsibility that these comments do not end up in their comment section.
__label__Evidence	Framing information within broader narratives helps people connect it to their values and worldviews
__label__Position	The Economy     The  NHS  The Environment  Immigration 
__label__Evidence	Agreed. The same is happening on a global level... France, Trump...
__label__Evidence	I agree it really is up to the publisher to include comments. I don't believe that not allowing a platform will reduce hate speech.
__label__Evidence	This works in terms of removing literal slurs from the platform, but doesn't account for when hate speech is more well-disguised or nebulous - how could we expect an automatic system to understand a dogwhistle?
__label__Evidence	I believe working hard to be comfortable is important but I also believe that when you have more money than is needed for a lifetime you have a responsibility to be outward thinking and help others. 
__label__Position	yes because people will rely on ai too much
__label__Evidence	Sadly not everyone can be polite enough to express themselves without the use of hate speech, hence such people should be blocked as we cannot tolerate it.
__label__Evidence	how do you decide what is disrespecful?
__label__Evidence	I think there is another group that is probably more a majority than the two groups mentioned. That group is the people who do care about the environment but is overwhelmed by the sheer cost and magnitude of the many things they are told they should be doing while also trying to navigate their own lives. And when they don't scream vocally about saving everything, they get accused of being part of the exploiting group.
__label__Position	I believe that if there was a program that could trace the people who are committing this crime and them getting punishment from the government law, it would reduce the hate speech. The problem is that people think they can get away. maybe this link can help: https://pmg.org.za/page/Prevention%20and%20Combating%20of%20Hate%20Crimes%20and%20Hate%20Speech%20Bill%20&%20International%20Crimes%20Bill:%20briefing,%20with%20Minister%20and%20Deputy%20Minister
__label__Evidence	but doesn't the detection ai get better at filtering the more it works?
__label__Position	returning as many SNP MPs to westminter to further independence for Scotland
__label__Position	Yes,because hate speech is not worth protecting,it only has bad effects.
__label__Position	by letting users know that hate speech can not be tolerated and then putting measures that can limit use of hate speech (warnings, report buttons, blocking, locking of accounts and also sensitizing users of consequences of using hate speech on comments space.
__label__Evidence	Moderators have their own biases and blind spots who would be picking the moderators?
__label__Position	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__Evidence	This sounds like a very expensive solution - I think maybe more time and money should be spent on algorithms that can do the same thing
__label__Evidence	also would allow anyone to say whatever hate they havem to say
__label__Position	NHS Backlog, LGBTQ rights, housing crisis, cost of living
__label__Position	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588
__label__Evidence	Maybe this can engender a difference of awareness in the society as a whole.

__label__Position	Reform of the NHS
__label__Evidence	You're absolutely right, and this is to be expected when right-wing governments who focus on raising money for their wealthy friends are in power
__label__Position	i have never voted before as ive always been of the opinion that my vote isnt gonna c
__label__Position	I think everyone feels that the current government have let us down - so is there a particular party that is currently looking as though they could rectify all these problems
__label__Evidence	What if the moderators are biased themselves?
__label__Position	More Admin and block buttons
__label__Evidence	Using an algorithm to automatically filter out posts that contain obviously offensive and derogatory words or phrases would be a good way of persevering free speech and spirited debate.
__label__Position	Newspapers will be commented on in other spheres anyway. by separating this from the newspaper site itself this allows for almost anything to be said on the matter (depending on the controls in those spheres). The advantage to allowing a comments section on the site itself but also moderated and with a reporting system in place, allows for any misdirects or fake news that may pop up in the comments to be directly addressed along side the article and will allow peoples views and voices to be heard
__label__Position	newspapers are there to give news.most times it is not the comments which bring the hate but rather the non ethical journalism that we have online and physically today. newspapers should not have comments and rather do what they were made to do: deliver news and let the people think for themselves. i believe too many people rely on other comments and interpretations of news to make up their mind, eliminating critical thinking.
__label__Position	This study and many others are useful ways to make sure that individuals are still able to express their opinions while limiting comments that are unhelpful and hurtful to certain individuals.
__label__Evidence	NHS is main priority for me too.
__label__Evidence	i agree, the tories have damaged the country for the last decade 
__label__Position	Using moderation. Unbiased moderation only.
__label__Position	This makes it hard fr the reader to connect to said topic as they cant express their views
__label__Evidence	Yes! The state of the current cost of living is crazy!
__label__Evidence	There is a growing body of evidence that everybody - not just the vulnerable - wearing masks significantly reduces the viral load in a confined space.
__label__Position	"The newspaper should have a fair definition of what defines ""hate speech"". The definition should be one, that many different political figures can publicly agree on."
__label__Position	In order to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. Active communinty management and moderation is required. This helps keep people in line with the community guildelines.
__label__Evidence	avoiding the issues does not eliminate it
__label__Position	it is true that is we censor too heavily hate speech that those responsible for initiating these movements will be held less accountable to their words and actions and would be more difficult to identify them and prevent future potentially worse incidents

__label__Position	creating standards in which comments are allowed that allow for different opinions to be expressed but for that to be done respectfully. A personalised system that would remove hate comments that should be set using a certain standard to measure what qualifies as hate speech.
__label__Position	Yes freedom of speech is a right and it should not be violated. In the same breath that right should not be abused or used to violate the rights of others. https://www.amnesty.eu/news/freedom-of-speech-carries-responsibilities-for-all-0250/
__label__Evidence	agreed 
__label__Evidence	agree with this totally, and I think that was my opinion earlier
__label__Position	Opting out. No responsibilities and no children and no debt. Goal won.
__label__Position	Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__Position	you cannot eliminate it.  dont try.  freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__Position	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree totally, as someone who has a child with learning difficulties, getting the proper support for them in school has been challenging.  More teachers, teaching assistants and training is required to bolster up the education sector.
__label__Position	hate speech can be fairly reduced by allowing other readers to either delete the inappropriate comment, another way would be to show the hate speech sender that their racist or homophobic comments can reach the real world and have real life concequences,they may lose jobs or a place in their university.
__label__Position	moderation is is very helpful in these instances,also having certain keywords automatically blocked.
__label__Evidence	Even if someone provides their personal details many people are still not deterred from commenting hate speech proof of this is that in Facebook where most people have their personal information they still comment hate speech in the comments on posts
__label__Position	moderating the comments would surely help
__label__Evidence	do you agree with part privatisation?
__label__Position	Comments sections should certainly not be removed, but certain words may be filtered if there is strong hate
__label__Position	If the truth is exposed and there is transparency.
__label__Evidence	free speech should be controlled but allowed
__label__Evidence	Other comments can also make other people sad
__label__Position	No, free speech should be a right despite of the positive/negative approach
__label__Evidence	Hateful comments should allow respondents to persuade otherwise.  Comments can be a good force for change and shouldn't be cancelled.
__label__Position	Public Finances, state of the NHS, rejoining the EU
__label__Evidence	What about people who have a view that is considered unpopular or opposing? Say it's election time - what would happen if one team uses tech-warriors to delete pro- opposition comments just because they go against their agenda?
__label__Evidence	they can monetize the paper
__label__Position	It is also in the newspapers own interest to put more effort into monitoring the comments section to avoid being held responsible for the comments. Although they should not sensibly be considered the publishers of the content themselves, they could be seen as connected to it in a secondary manner if they do not properly deal with its removal. https://www.presscouncil.ie/about-us/recent-decisions-and-news/combatting-hate-speech-in-print-and-broadcasting-media
__label__Position	NHS and infrastructure, such as roads, water, electric.
__label__Position	Automated moderation can be useful but there will always be the need for human moderation (Goodman, 2013) https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf
__label__Evidence	Yes, any views shoudl be substantiated and when its obvious that it serves an agenda it should be deleted
__label__Evidence	Lots of positive characteristics here! Vision and influence definitely key - and with the latter: excellent negotiation skills, conflict management, diplomacy are critical.
__label__Evidence	I'm not sure the answers to those questions but if more of us put pressure on policy makers to invest funds into scientific studies it would give us a greater idea, but no one seems to care or want to spend any money to improve understanding of the issue.
__label__Position	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__Position	The purpose of a comment section is for everyone to express their opinions on a certain topic and can provide feedback. Completely removing the comment section may be disadvantageous in some cases so instead of completely removing it perhaps it can be moderated on a regular basis and remove inappropriate comments.
__label__Evidence	I think if the hateful users find other places to share their opinions, they might find similar minded people and create a hateful community that might do more harm than just the individuals
__label__Position	what is the point of comments if not all views are allowed to be expressed?
__label__Evidence	We have flattened their countries and bled them dry, that is why they come seeking work.  The keep the NHS afloat.  
__label__Evidence	The comment space gives users a way to vent out their frustration. It is not always nice to see derogatory language but when there is a healthy discussion, it helps people reading them to find very informative.
__label__Evidence	This would then stop freedom of speech
__label__Position	housing
__label__Evidence	Scottish Independence has had its day. How can Scotland support itself?
__label__Evidence	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.
__label__Evidence	Ai could be used to flag, but then an experienced arbitrator is needed to decide if item removed
__label__Position	Mainly financial 
__label__Position	I firmly think that removing the comment section is inappropriate as people have a freedom of speech however, certain systematic updates should be installed that filter out or flag the hate comments. If the comment is found to be hate speech it will notify the sender and not publish the comment to keep the flow of the conversation.
__label__Position	I am in favour of the Reform Party because I believe in upholding the people's referendum. Brexit must be maintained
__label__Position	I think that if we don't do something to start combatting climate change today, literally nothing will be there in the future to worry about - no economy left if there's no livable Earth left to inhabit. We're going to have to address this at some point, why not now? I'm not convinced that we can reverse what has already been done (ie, extinct species), but we can change the course of the future.
__label__Position	The BBC has a big problem with its news. A huge medical scandal (WPath) has recently been covered up completely.
__label__Evidence	I don't think that simply mitigating the problem should be our focus. 
__label__Evidence	brexit was voted democratically by a majority people need to deal with it if they disagree if you start ignoring democracy the country will fail sorry to tell you but democracy is important and just cause you disagree doesnt mean we should undo something voted democratically i agree others may have different opinions but it comes off a bit of a sore loser if you strt whining about your vote losing yeah i know it sucks but is a part of live honestly 
__label__Evidence	I agree, and I think it's best to ban some words that will offend people. I also think the users who are trolls should be banned early on to protect the comment section.
__label__Position	Hate speech can mean different things to different people
__label__Evidence	i believe there is no cons at all
__label__Evidence	I completely agree with this. This will make an open space for people to leave their comments but also make sure that everything is checked before its posted.
__label__Position	There's no easy solution, too much censorship and it gives the trolls a reason to complain, not enough and it allows hate speech to thrive.
__label__Evidence	But if people´s right to speek is crossing the border towards hatered speech then you are disregarding another´s right of respect 
__label__Evidence	A vibe and I totally agree
__label__Position	I want to see a properly funded NHS, public services and roads that are fit for purpose, a commitment to address environmental issues and 
__label__Position	I mean it is hard to find a solution for this matter, some people will say that you are taking there free speech away and some might say that you are not doing anything to solve this matter. In my opinion, I am for free speech and freedom but when your free speech and freedom are used to attack me then you are attacking my freedom too, and with that you destroyed the thing that you stand for and defend.

__label__Position	Covid, corruption, state of all infrastructure in England (environment, NHS, transport etc)
__label__Position	Once you are found commenting with hate speech, you should apologize
__label__Position	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article:   https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230

__label__Evidence	the cost of paying someone to monitor this
__label__Position	Have an automated word elimination that will detect words that promote hate speech and not allow them to be posted.
__label__Position	"I'm not sure we can ever do this, although I agree it needs to be done. Maybe if people had to comment under their real names all the time and not use ""usernames"", they wouldn't be so quick to do it."
__label__Position	fair choice
__label__Position	I support the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence as an option to identify hate speech, in particular hate speech that is directed at specific peoples or designed to incite violent, aggressive or destructive behaviour
__label__Position	In summary most of the points made regarding the elimination of hate speech were very insightful and some were really good ideas. The idea to have users flag bad comments and they be hidden and later checked by moderators was a great idea, another good idea was to help make people aware of the impact hate speech causes to some individuals.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is not the problem here. We need to educate people to make the right choices.
__label__Evidence	An issue is how can we differentiate being aggressive from being passionate. This only leaves room for newspapers to censor comments they do not like.
__label__Evidence	Differing opinions mare easily recognized for what they are. Whereas as hate speech can spark a lot of dangerous events. The comment's section helps people share knowledge easily and if it's not serving that purpose then it should not be allowed.  https://researchoutreach.org/articles/hate-speech-regulation-social-media-intractable-contemporary-challenge/
__label__Evidence	we cannot remove reviewer comments altogether. i believe a method to filter or censored hate speech is necessary.
__label__Position	"Many publications in the US media have shut off comments sections and are doing this because they believe that whilst it possibly spreads hate speech, it also has the ability to spread ""fake news"" or skew readers away from the facts contained in the articles. You can read more about it here: https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments/"

__label__Position	How trustworthy I find the candidates

__label__Position	To keep the refrigerant management and forest restoration helps to change the climate.It could take a very long period of time but coming decades are survive easily.
__label__Position	A high level buy in is needed for reducing hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments
__label__Evidence	I agree it would be a good solution better than moderators because moderators are humans and they can make mistakes.
__label__Evidence	People still need the comment section since it allows for open conversation and allows for people to find like mnded individuals.
__label__Evidence	I think this solution can be very intrusive. Especially in a times where our personal data is being collected as a commodity.
__label__Evidence	Not more funding, but better use of the money they have.
__label__Position	We must make sure that we read news from trusted sources only or use reliable social media
__label__Position	"The newest ""science"" related to this topic now questions how additional greenhouses in our atmosphere truly effects atmospheric and climate change. It looks to be that additional carbon dioxide does not have as dramatic an effect on temperature as previously purposed. This is cause to re-question what actually would need to be reversed and how much influence our consumption of fossil fuels actually has on global climate.  "
__label__Position	I believe people should be freely allowed to express their opinions on whatever form of information is presented to them. However, there is etiquette to everything we do. If you cannot produce a compelling argument without approaching the area of hate speech then the internet isn't for you. I believe in order to regulate these areas, participants and viewers should be informed of any rules and regulations to the newspaper website, then accepting or declining said rules will give you access. In the case of a violation of the rules, moderators should remove individuals from the space, essentially banning them as they did not follow the rules, in that case they will need to message an administrator to possibly receive access once again.
__label__Position	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech. But the question still remains, when is it just a hateful comment and not hatred or propaganda. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression in press and other media. To some extent we dont have a right to block them from expressing their thoughts
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by giving fair and non-critical comments that does not necessarily aim at bashing or making readers uncomfortable. We can be guided by acts that protect readers and that may try reducing hate speech without reducing the actual freedom of expression or speech.
__label__Evidence	Dental care is, as my NHS care was taken away. 
__label__Position	I shall not be voting Conservative in this election as they have done little to address the NHS crisis in the last 14 years. We all know that there are too few beds but still more beds are not provided. It's a simple matter that would aleviate many problems.
__label__Position	I also want to see the NHS and the education system put back on their feet.
__label__Evidence	you can't exclude people from their own community
__label__Evidence	I hope there is far less discussion about trans anything, they get a massively disproportionate level of attention but hopefully that is just due to it being the current woke issue. 
__label__Position	this is a great idea there should also be a disclaimer that those who post hate speech will be banned from commenting or they will face a harsher punishment
__label__Position	haters may be removed is the system is able to identify them...so I think comment space can be kept but regulated 
__label__Evidence	Changing diets is difficult due to cultural factors
__label__Position	healthcare 
__label__Position	Vote Reform or nothing is going to change
__label__Evidence	Research suggests that platforms have a responsibility to moderate hate speech on platforms in a bid to keep the internet open and healthier: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/247 01475.2022.2105123
__label__Evidence	True but having set standards could help reduce it effectively because freedom of speech also comes with responsibility.
__label__Evidence	I share the same opinion on that having a bot that can check for hate speech is the way either block users who use hate speech or put them on time out.
__label__Position	There can never truly be free speech. While we can try and censor words that might be offensive, there will always be someone offended whether that was your intention or not. I don't think there will be a solution to this
__label__Position	We should focus communication efforts on the middle ground rather than trying to persuade extreme positions
__label__Evidence	Moral and ethical values (e.g. equality, right to clean healthy environment) shape fair environmental and social change. It should ensure that excluded stakeholders get to part in decisions that affect their environment and quality of life. 
__label__Evidence	The lack of funding is embarrassing, NHS is the  backbone of our country
__label__Evidence	Whilst I agree that the platforms should be responsible, with the vast numbers of people contributing to some platforms it is virtually impossible to moderate every single comment.
__label__Evidence	I agree and also that some comment may not have been posed to upset/hurt, but can do, so educating people in how to respond would be a good thing.
__label__Evidence	Some feedback is sometimes good for the growth of the newspaper website
__label__Position	Comments can do many things like broaden people's perspective or dilute the validity of the news. But when you remove comments then people will not be able to appreciate all the different things that comments can do. The 'bad' in this case does not outweigh the 'benefit' of having a comment section.
__label__Evidence	essential for the country 
__label__Evidence	Leadership at the OU also needs to model diversity and inclusion which it does not
__label__Evidence	I still think newspapers hold quite a bit of merit when it comes to what they post.
__label__Evidence	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.
__label__Evidence	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.
__label__Position	Could we potentially invest in education or public information campaigns about the impact of hate speech, perhaps using popular figures e.g. Marcus Rashford?
__label__Position	i think its the cost of living and making core costs affordable so public can manage
__label__Evidence	Exactly. People want to feel as if they are part of the conversation. Removing the comment section just has the opposite effect.
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by using moderators to filter the comments before publishing.
__label__Evidence	https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/
__label__Evidence	Same although i think there will always be element of them being in it for themselves 
__label__Evidence	needs to be installed
__label__Evidence	Comment moderators who filter, edit, moderate, and encourage user comments can monitor these and make sure that they respect the rules and boundaries of the website/portal/online
__label__Evidence	That is a valid point , but completely removing the comment section is not the best solution for it
__label__Evidence	I leave a link to the study: https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/
__label__Evidence	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.
__label__Evidence	agree. It does need a revamp but that doesn't mean it needs to be privatised
__label__Position	After reading a ;lot of peoples comments on this matter i still believe the best way to help this subject is to have moderators on the website in questions to keep hate speech off of the website.
__label__Evidence	Moderators who follow specific guidelines so that they are all consistent would be the best option to eleiminate bias
__label__Evidence	Developing new technologies may be complicated and expensive
__label__Evidence	public finances are in a mess and there doesnt seem to be anyone suggesting a realistic way of sorting it out without costing the tax payer heavily
__label__Position	they should monitor all comments and block people that post hate comments or censor certain hate words
__label__Position	immigration has to be sorted out?
__label__Evidence	yes definately, removal of the section is an infringement rather find a way to navigate around sensitive or hate speech comments. maybe burn subscription of that particular individual

__label__Evidence	I agree that the sooner we act the better. Every day climate change grows.
__label__Position	The evidence below gives you an indication that informaed moderation does work, especially were that to be combined withexplicit rules and things like a warning system.
__label__Evidence	Greenhouse gases were drastically higher when the dinosaurs walked, and earth survived just fine. Climate change can always be reversed, the question is simply how much effort over what period of time.
__label__Evidence	Yes, the most easy way to make sure that people don't spread hate speech any further would be to educate people on the steps that should be done before posting any of your opinions. https://www.thecommentingclub.co.uk/sharing-your-opinion/
__label__Position	I have no knowledge to share, but perhaps I can use that positively by posing a few 'stupid' questions: - What are the threats to heritage buildings from climate change? - What are the threats to climate change from heritage buildings?
__label__Position	Moderators should be used, as well comments that are flagged as hate speech can be moved towards the bottom of the comments and hidden so they are less visible, till a moderator can remove them.
__label__Position	The idea behind that is to locked people expression and democratic, we do not need to police everyone, there is a certain freedom of expression
__label__Position	education is the solution
__label__Evidence	Local services are falling apart.
__label__Evidence	I think that you're right.  I'd rather have the hate speech than restrict free speech.
__label__Position	There is hope for peace through a two-state solution
__label__Evidence	There comments may be offensive to others.
__label__Evidence	I agree that limiting freedom of speech is not the solution. The algorithm should be able to pick up certain words/phrases that can then filter the hate speech.
__label__Evidence	There are far more sustainablity actions that should be taken before dietary constrictions, like reducing the loop of consumption in the US which is based on inflation and debt generation.
__label__Position	 The key issues are the economy, education, defence and security and the environment and also who would be a good leader
__label__Position	We can also do this through letting moderators know how it feels to be victim to hate speech online, through getting hate speech victims to describe what it feels like, so moderators are more precise with their moderation!
__label__Position	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree this is absolutely huge, but we need to reposition it, not make it so doom-laden as it turns many people off. There are opportunities for green technology, get ahead of the energy transition etc. Small changes by lots of people make a difference.
__label__Position	looking after the worker. No one in work should be worse off than someone who doesn't work
__label__Evidence	Good way to educate society.
__label__Evidence	this is extreme. I am sure we - as a humanity - can find a way to keep living in this planet while enjoying every once in a while a good steak.
__label__Evidence	It's a good idea, but too many get giddy at trying to break rules and in doing so, ruin things.
__label__Evidence	I think people are so wary of giving personal information out online that this would put people off commenting and while this might deter 'keyboard warriors' who are happy to hide behind a screen I dont think it would be helpful to have the threat of being tracked down. It feels very big brother coercive and could potentially lead to people feeling attacked which may make them lash out but also feel justified in their opnions
__label__Position	I think that there should be techologies that are able to scan and the comment section to detect and flag any offensive/vulgar words in the comments before the comments are published.
__label__Position	Hate speech promotes cyber bullying and the spread of fake news. It is the responsibility of the newspapers to maintain their credibility by ensuring that they do not allow hate speech on their sites. They should have a better algorithm that will filter out hate comments or not even allow them to be posted at all.
__label__Evidence	Completely agree - Brexit was voted for because of our delightful racist nation. A large number of pewople voted leave because they thought it would stop immigranats into the country. Obviously there were some genuine voters, But Brexit has done more damage than good. We have lost so many decent foreign workers that provide essential services particularly in the Health and medical sector. 
__label__Evidence	I don't think this is the way forward - check out this article:https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-advances-to-better-detect-hate-speech/
__label__Position	Medium posted an interstng debate on the pros ad cons of censoring hate speech within the news. https://medium.com/the-lonestar/censoring-hate-speech-pros-and-cons-3f54b572b3f0 this made a strong arguemnt for the censorship of hate speech withint he media.
__label__Evidence	Who gets to determine what exactly IS hate speech? It's a slippery slope that eventual will deem everything hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Some people are going through problems in their own life and express their anger online. None of which is acceptable.
__label__Evidence	yes, there is a reason why poorest uk families hit the hardest cost of living crisis 
__label__Position	The amount of illegal immigration there is in the country. The cost of living crisis, food and energy prices
__label__Position	a system where people have to submit personal information before they can post a comment is a good idea. This could be reduce hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I feel the UK would not have much influence here - Israel would just ignore us.
__label__Position	Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.
__label__Position	NHS. economy, levels of immigration
__label__Evidence	I am also changing who I vote for, and not bothering to vote tactically either as the most likely candidate to win has also produced weasel words on the big issues that are going to affect the local area. I've decided to register my discontent by voting for one of the smaller parties whose priorities align most closely with my own 
__label__Evidence	Agree, and to be held accountable for their promises 
__label__Evidence	I have changed my vote for the first time in my life - voted by post. I am totally disenchanted by the depressing standard of human being that is offered by the two main parties.  They never answer questions and swerve with their repetitive rhetoric. They take the public for fools and wind their sentences away from every question. How can ANYONE believe in those kinds of people.  They are out for themselves ONLY.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	"The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of ""cognitive dissonance"" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context."
__label__Evidence	surely this should be the job of the editor to make sure the journalists are impartial
__label__Position	Is there really some hope for the planet from this conference or is it just mambo-jumbo nonsense? 
__label__Position	Taxation
__label__Position	I don't think censoring peoples opinions that you do not agree with on certain topics is in one a way or another a form of hate, I think it's a hypocrisy that you want your opinion to be heard,  but also don't want the other side's opinion to be heard.
__label__Position	1.  Integration of the comment section with a non-anonymous social media platform such as Facebook is necessary to reduce hate speech.  2. We need to address the issue of social media encouraging polarising views. Most social media of nowadays allows you create a bubble that shares a singular opinion without looking outside of the bubble. The lack of exposure would contribute to the hate speech.  3. The education system needs an almost complete overhaul. Education about things such as critical thinking, marginalised groups, bullying, creativity and imagination would reduce hate speech because they are well educated.  4. Consideration for every student is important. Things that could prevent a child from learning efficiently are important such as learning disabilities, poverty, etc. They should be addressed by using things like free lunches and creating accommodations. Paying students to go to university would encourage even greater critical thinking 5.  The government should care more for its citizens. It is things such as poverty and illness inducing stress that could prevent people from thinking clearly before they speak. Prioritizing happiness and wellbeing would most definitely contribute to the lowering of hate speech by for example, highlighting the country’s nature, prioritising social welfare, and closing the gap between the rich and poor. In conclusion, the truth of the matter is that people have these horrible opinions because they are stressed about something and cannot think clearly. That and a lack of education. Focusing on these issues would result in a massive decrease of hate speech
__label__Position	Positions and policies on education, cost of living, economy, national service, NHS funding, benefit funding/support
__label__Evidence	Stops hates speech
__label__Evidence	This would allow comment sections to remain open while reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__Position	I think the newspaper website should not eliminate the space comments but rather create a merchanism or system that will allow comments to be vetted first by the editorial team before the comment can actually be visible for everyone to see it. the system could be in a such a way that it immediately flags down any comment that violate netiquette
__label__Evidence	We will discuss solutions too
__label__Evidence	With entropy, all efforts to restore the atmospheric gas balance will still leave a lot of the changes to the worldfor a very long time.Mitigation might be all we can do at this point,rather than being able to fully reverse it.
__label__Evidence	Not a bad idea, give them all a shot at working together, instead of ripping each other apart 
__label__Position	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__Position	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__Position	I think giving particulars when you comment will help with accountability
__label__Position	This would have severe positive environmental advantages
__label__Position	"Negativity is permitted and valid but hate speech is not. People do not deserve to hide behind the arguement of ""free speech"" to spread hateful messages"
__label__Position	By blocking those users who spew hate speech completely. The page could notify and warn all users prior that hate speech will not be tolerated
__label__Position	Algorithms to check for problematic words & phrases, Trigger Warnings should be provided by users, & Paid Moderators.
__label__Evidence	Anonymity may also prevent people to explore ideas they feel are taboo and prevent them from seeking help. e.g. addiction, some LGBTQ+ issues that are taboo in certain cultures etc.
__label__Position	Moderation seems to be the most reasonable solution to solve hate speech comments and there are various algorithms in place which can monitor platforms for hate speech and flag them (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006)
__label__Evidence	Then it would always be the medias word over the public
__label__Position	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__Position	have moderators monitor the comments and delete innapropriate comments. use an algorythm to pick out certain hate speech words and delete the response, and block the writer from the chat.
__label__Position	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__Evidence	In a fast moving comments section with lots of commentators it would be impossible to moderate in real time.
__label__Evidence	I hope you get it! Carer's work very hard and are underpaid :( 
__label__Evidence	There is a website that tells you who is more likely to win your area if you want to vote tactically. Whoever gets in (assuming it's not the Tories) is going to have a monster job sorting out the chaos that is currently in place 
__label__Position	It still seems important to focus more on reporting the news and far less on giving a newspapers opinion of the news. But straight news doesn't make the clicks or the money. Looking at the current changes to CNN are a good indication that anger sells and straight news does not.The anger is what keeps the comments sections alive.
__label__Evidence	Labour is the same as Conservatives
__label__Evidence	hate speech will take over the comment section. it is as the website owner to instate policies.
__label__Evidence	True, but people take freedom of speech and it gives them the right to say whatever they want, without fear of persecution
__label__Evidence	if everyone had this opinion, we would live in chaos. Vote for what you stand for! 
__label__Evidence	i kind of agree... If you tell someone the news and they respond with hate speech, it's not your fault or your responsibility to silence them
__label__Evidence	Facts
__label__Position	I believe that a moderated comments section is the way forward. I don't believe that eliminating it completely will solve hate rhetoric online as people will move to other forums/platforms to do this.
__label__Evidence	how do you regulate what hate speech is and who by?
__label__Evidence	Some comments can be seen as hate speech but they are not hate speech. They will be taken down and that will prevent freedom of speech
__label__Position	I'm having trouble reading the comments on here.  The page keeps moving.  I can only confirm what I have already written that comments should be allowed but would have to be moderated in some way.  I don't know how this would happen, since there could be too many comments for a human to police.  Perhaps a combination of a bot checking comments and a real human might work.  I don't think you will completely eliminate hate speech because everyone has different life experiences.  It should be up to the individual to realise what makes sense instead of enforcing a kind of nanny state.  People should be able to make up their own minds. The issue happens when you become the target and how it can affect you personally.  However, I still believe that we need freedom of speech and the only way to stop it is to police the comments and discourage by criminalising it to empower victims. This article looks at both sides:- https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place. A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__Evidence	I dont know how we have got to this as a country allowing the boats to come everyday full of people, we are a small island, why cant our borders be closed? what is the solution?
__label__Evidence	i enjoy reading comments but some comments can be sweary,name calling, troll like behaviour, which should be stopped.
__label__Position	The boats, Immigration, NHS Policing
__label__Position	Agriculture, economy, health services
__label__Position	I think without the comments you will not be able to react to what you have read and have your say
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	With every right comes responsibly so your right cannot impose on others
__label__Position	Allow users to report comments.
__label__Position	I think reversing manmade climate change would be very difficult. Scientists might come up with solutions to attempt it, but I don't think it can be totally reversed.
__label__Position	the labour party's treatment of socialists and the left in general
__label__Evidence	moderation is good
__label__Evidence	They waste so much money, and there is a lack of joined up thinking across the NHS as a whole. Too much is left to individual trusts.
__label__Evidence	It would enable citizens to make better informed decisions
__label__Evidence	Discussions helps to deepen learning, to remove it completely would hinder what you could know but they need to be monitored for sure. Hate speech is not okay.
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__Position	cancelling the comment section wont be viable as the main aim is not to eliminate.
__label__Evidence	The state should buy land and built social housing instead of leaving it to the free market. 
__label__Position	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__Position	To have moderators in place.
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__Evidence	The government should be focusing on taxes to help improve the econamy
__label__Evidence	Sometimes being harsh can be kind to the person who may not realise what they're doing.
__label__Evidence	Comments should add to the article though and the commenters often go down a facebook-style rant about something not helpful or relevant, I don't think this is the right space for this
__label__Evidence	The first and simple advice often given by one of my colleagues is “thicker curtains across window and doors” . It’s short term and achievable for residents while other interventions are in planning (John Preston) 
__label__Position	The cost of living/inflation, the NHS, illegal immigration and increasing taxation
__label__Evidence	Good idea, never going to happen though!
__label__Evidence	Definitely agree, you seem to be penalised for working 
__label__Position	Comment spaces should remain and other readers should be able to rate comments and flag them for removal if they are thought to be inappropriate.  Moderators should be used with caution as there is a risk that they will behave in a biased way and not respect free speech.
__label__Evidence	This would set the tone on the level of maturity that is required for the targeted group.
__label__Evidence	Many people have no idea what embodied carbon is, for example, and so some jargon-busting infomercials might be very helpful?
__label__Position	Reducing it requires everyone is the comment section to be willing to educate people who feel expresssing hate speech is a freedom of speech. Working together as the world and the newspaper to elaborate if the confusion is beyond. Somethimes it happens because people dont understand whats actually happening.
__label__Evidence	accountability by inputting details is a good solution
__label__Position	By simply monitoring the comments and blocking the negative ones and removing them
__label__Position	Invest in the NHS 
__label__Evidence	giving those you always provide hate speech anonymously gives them the upper hand with gettong away with it. It makes it easier for them to do it over and over again
__label__Evidence	This would be an effective measure in preventing hate speech from being published.
__label__Position	Pensions, Immigraation, the NHS, 
__label__Evidence	Ridiculous waiting times  
__label__Position	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted  to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__Position	monitoring each and every users s comments and warn the users that posts hate speech, and if they continue to posts comments of hate speech after several warnings  then take  down their accounts or ban them from the website.
__label__Evidence	I don't think blocking key words that in the majority could only be expressed in a hateful way would give them unilateral power. it is possible to do this under instagram posts and I dont think the majority of people would even notice
__label__Evidence	i agree with this comment,
__label__Position	Moderation, as a paid (not volunteer) role.
__label__Evidence	The possibilities of negative consequences of allowing hate speech are well-documented, including the violence in post-independence Kenya (iHub research).
__label__Position	NHS and immigration and crime in the uk has been a large concern
__label__Position	No, discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	My key issues are cost of living, education and transparency, I have also thought about which party is down to earth and touch with reality , however in terms of deciding to vote as I have no particular affinity with one party this time I have decided to vote ttactically
__label__Evidence	That could help, although that would take a long of time. Also at the end of the day, whoever writes hateful speech do not see the dangers of what they are doing. According to an article in The Guardian, some people think this is just the internet and it does not reflect true life.
__label__Evidence	We shouldn't have to see it regardless.
__label__Evidence	Obviously there will be bias from the moderators as well, so this too will need to be kept in mind.
__label__Position	I'm not sure if it will work but they can  put a sign on the website that says no to hate comments allowed. Or a report button can also help then administrator can review the reported comments
__label__Evidence	Newspapers often weave opinion in to their presentation of the news, they don't always report just in a purely factual manner. No comment sections at all would stifle discussion.
__label__Evidence	some of them have made a fortune fron it
__label__Position	By creating rules that state you can't say things you wouldn't be comfortable saying in real life. Having automated monitoring of hateful slurs and create warning for posts that seem hateful based on an AI model.
__label__Evidence	people with positive comments won't be able to share
__label__Position	i think one of the best ways is to allow everyone  a free space of commenting yet making sure that all the hate speech is automatically blocked no one can see those comments except the administrator
__label__Position	Showing people how victims of online hate speech have suffered might help to educate people on how not to conduct themselves.
__label__Evidence	I agree. This sounds like a good plan.
__label__Evidence	Agree with your suggestions.  I had the same idea.  However, there would need to be a way to get around mispellings of words to get around the blocked vocabulary.
__label__Position	Why trust any of them?
__label__Position	This comment was removed because it broke the hate speech policy of this webstie.
__label__Position	funding and backing of NHS
__label__Evidence	Agree with the freedom of speech curtailing. But hate speech can be avoided while also expressing opinions.
__label__Evidence	I was once asked to consider being a politician and my answer was, I can't because I am too honest! So yes, not surprised any politician is 100% honest...name one who is if you do know of him/her/they
__label__Evidence	But with freedoms we have to consider the repsonsibilities that come along with those. Your frredoms dont give you a right to infringe uopn anothers right by discriminating agaisnt them. Majority of constituions talk about freedoms and right but we cannot be only selfish and forget about anothers right to freedom and dignity.
__label__Evidence	something needs to be done about 'hate speech' so moderators would be a good idea,
__label__Position	I believe that we could also find a legal solution for reducing hate speech. I believe we need a new legislation particularly for hate speech in the Internet. When people knew that hate speech could be criminal offence, most of them would not post it.
__label__Position	the lack of affordable housing is for me a key issue, but has hardly been addressed; the general level of corrption
__label__Evidence	I agree, because not all comments will be hate speech, some are positive.
__label__Position	i agree that moderators have their uses but then unless they are trained properly their biases may creep in
__label__Evidence	It would reduce duplication of effort and increase quality of deliberative processes
__label__Position	A lot depends upon how it's implemented. If it's just a free-for-all without any sort of reputation system, we know that it will become a cesspool. If carefully designed, it can be a useful resource. Fair to remove? I think it's up to the newspaper to decide if they want to support such a resource.
__label__Evidence	Allows for more discourse
__label__Position	The newspaper must filter hate speech words
__label__Position	Verify all persons that can comment on the reader's comment section, this way everyone can be responsible and not hide behind anonymity.
__label__Evidence	I honestly don't think any of them are trustworthy and I really feel like I'm only voting for one party because I don't want the other party
__label__Evidence	I support this, moderation should be visible.
__label__Position	I think there should be freedom of speech and expression of opinions. However, people should get an education first in order to create a positive and useful environment.
__label__Position	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial.  Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__Position	I think that comments sections should remain on websites, but that they should be heavily regulated. Filter words could be used to discourage and identify hate speech, but in addition I think there should be someone who monitors comments for misinformation and who will respond with information and links in order to correct misinformed commenters. Comments are great to help encourage reflection and other viewpoints, but they can be very damaging.
__label__Evidence	I think the idea is marvellous, it will prevent pointless comments that are intended to hurt other readers or those mentioned in the articles. If they are to be available for speculation. They would need to monitor the comment section and not delay in removing harmful comments.
__label__Position	Housing crisis
__label__Position	Getting rid of the Tories
__label__Evidence	my rent doubled 18 mths ago and new contract means it will continue to rise, it will never go back down. Plus I have no housing security.
__label__Position	i think writers should also be careful of how they write their articles because sometimes their angles are the ones encouraging hate speech
__label__Position	"""It is important to attract young people to study the built environment, sustainability, civil engineering, just as they currently focus on building new information systems. If we don't make these topics attractive to young students, the skills gap will only increase"" (Paul Norman, Clarion Housing Group) "
__label__Evidence	The statement is correct we need to talk about climate change for future because it is more helpful for the future generation. The federal government need to take the step about the climate change so it may be helpful for the upcoming generation.
__label__Position	57b4e9d152a08d0001d1b9dc I don't think that pensions are high enough for the cost of living.
__label__Evidence	there's a lot of truth to that statement, the banks are constantly barraging us with credit, gov does nothing about it. All in the pocket of the super rich ] 
__label__Evidence	I don't believe the comments section should be removed as everyone is entitled to a voice
__label__Evidence	I agree as there is a lot of content online that is false or relies on small data that is not reliable. For instance, see this link on fact checking content https://www.ntu.ac.uk/about-us/news/news-articles/2021/12/fake-news-and-fact-checking-study-examines-social-media-use-during-the-pandemic
__label__Position	more funding for the NHS
__label__Evidence	this literally defeats the point of the internet. We stopped being passive consumers a while ago, and removing the ability to express your opinion  is moving back instead of forward.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is a blurred line and comes in different forms based on factors such as geography.
__label__Evidence	We're simply not getting a fair return for all the different taxes taken from us.
__label__Position	I don't think there is hate speech in newspapers
__label__Evidence	do u really know the meaning of hate speeches?
__label__Evidence	While I mostly agree, I question whether a newspaper's goal is engage in discussion. It would likely depend on the paper. Some print media is certainly for discussion.
__label__Evidence	People often confuse with freedom of speech to think that this protects hate speech, it does not and should not
__label__Evidence	But allowing hate speech to flourish would mean that comment space would be filled with spammers and hate speech and it would become useless.
__label__Position	Hate speech can alter people's opinions against people who do not read the articles in detail, however, this should mean that people should pay more attention to the article itself before viewing the comments section
__label__Evidence	I agree with your idea. However, there is a thin line between freedom of speech and hate speech. How will it be made more transparent to others what is what?
__label__Position	immigration and cost of living
__label__Evidence	If National Service was ever likely to become a policy, i.e., if the Conservatives had a chance of winning, fundingwould be the big issue, but they were never going to win, so this is a non-issue to me.
__label__Evidence	absolutely 
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs 
__label__Evidence	totally this is big
__label__Position	Corruption needs to be stamped out. This is a problem that applies to all political parties.
__label__Position	part of the issue is that heated debate cretes clicks - and newspapers love that esp the red tops. they live off incitement in the first place
__label__Evidence	I believe that most people actually do realize the damage that hate speech can cause and are either deliberately using a platform to incite violence/harm/distress or just don't care as they dont see the people they are using hate speech against as being worth feeling for. There is enough research now to show the direct links between hate speech and hate crimes
__label__Evidence	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments deemed as inappropriate, perhaps with a limit of how many they can do, otherwise I can see some taking advantage of this feature and flagging every comment they disagree with.
__label__Evidence	Yes, I fully agree with this. Everyone should be allowed the opportunity to comment, however the comments should be monitored  because as much as everyone has the right to freedom of speech ,it  must not negatively affect the next person.
__label__Position	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__Evidence	its nice to live in a kind society
__label__Evidence	When the local labour party canvassed on my doorstep (currently conservative area) I had this conversation with the Labour candidate, who is local and has served the community for years - I would 'trust' (as much as you can a politician) her but the leadership needs strenght and conviction and vision but is it better than what we have? Possibly
__label__Evidence	Agreed but This would only ever work if whoever won had all seats in parliament 
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Position	No, the newspaper should represent freedom for all kinds of speech.
__label__Evidence	I think it is part of the responsibility of having a website. If the newspaper is not listed as a +18 platform for using insults or hate speech, then young people would be affected.
__label__Position	agriculture, the economy, health services
__label__Evidence	I think hate speech should not be accepted . If its published on news platform then that signifies that its is condoned!
__label__Position	Leaders you can trust to do the right thing for the country
__label__Position	There should be some kinda strict word filtering systems with hired moderators that look through comment to identify potentially or offensive content, and also giving users clear guidance on whats permitted and whats not permitted
__label__Evidence	The best way forward would be for both sides to respect the 1967 borders
__label__Position	realistically hate speech cannot be eliminated but preventative measures cane be put in place to minimise its presence
__label__Evidence	There are plenty of brownfield land, I don't know why we can't build on that 
__label__Position	Tax, Employment and NHS are the major factors to consider.
__label__Evidence	then where can conversations happen which might help people expand their positions?
__label__Position	Those commenting with hate speech should be punished
__label__Position	Filters should be put into place in order to prevent hate speech in readers comments, filtering specific words that should not be accepted. This will allow readers to give their opinions and consider others', without giving rise to hate speech
__label__Evidence	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.
__label__Evidence	Regardless of whether stories need opinions added to them, people will do it anyway
__label__Evidence	There are certain steps we can take to help with climate change. Just sitting back sayin that nothing can be done isn't helping anything. We need to step up and take steps toward improving the situation. 
__label__Evidence	I disagree only in as much as they are not key issues for me personally, although I'm as appalled as most people at the awful loss of life in the ME conflict.  Unfortunately this has rumbled on in one form or another for decades.  I don't know the solution.  As far as discrimination, I pray that Reform bomb in the polls. 
__label__Evidence	I bet you believe the earth is flat as well
__label__Position	I don't think it's a good idea to eliminate the comment space from newspapers, thereby reducing readers' ability to weigh in on news items. I think newspapers should use software programs that can flag potentially hateful commentary and automatically remove it. As well, newspapers should have moderators who can check to make sure that any hate speech is caught and removed as soon as possible after it appears.
__label__Evidence	This is the one problem that no one on this planet can run from. Your ignorance, your disbelief and even you money can only save you for so long. There is no coming back from making our planet nonviable for all living things.
__label__Evidence	The main question is how to determine what is considered as discrimination or violence. Opposing arguments can be flagged as discrimination or violense.
__label__Position	I don't feel that climate change is all man made, but we should be doing things to help the earth in general. 
__label__Evidence	good idea if the AI was reliable
__label__Position	"Flag known and ""popular"" derogatory terms automatically through the platform which does not allow you to post the comment without using the politically correct terms"
__label__Evidence	This is a good solution which would reduce burden on moderators, whilst also automating some of the process.
__label__Evidence	Who?
__label__Position	Another, which is less important to me is the reform of the criminal justice system.  
__label__Position	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__Evidence	it is important for media to be criticised in order to validate it we do not have to accept what is written
__label__Evidence	I think this is a good solution for the problem. People will always find a way around it but it will eliminate at least some hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	One-size-fits-all policies may not work for all regions
__label__Position	Using a system that will block hate words is an option to address this issue. However the newspaper must be careful of not using the platform to block views that may differ from theirs.
__label__Position	Sometimes - though counter-intuitative - disallowing free speech, you are safeguarding freedom of speech!
__label__Evidence	I agree. Children should be taught in schools the value to expressing their opinions but also the difference in expressing and opinion and spreading hate.
__label__Position	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__Evidence	Inequality yes- but regarding what exactly?
__label__Evidence	there is no common sense with hate speech so it cant be classed as free speech
__label__Position	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speech from newspaper platforms without eliminating space for readers comments I personally think when a hate speech has been posted, a report must be made immediately and the admin can deleted the hate speech
__label__Evidence	This is an invasion of privacy.
__label__Position	systems need to be able to flag hateful speech in posts and remove them timelessly
__label__Position	It would be a shame to remove the comment space from online newspaper articles - although I don't think that removing it would be undemocratic, or an infringement of freedom of speech.  People are free to pass comment elsewhere after all, in their own blogs or social media pages.  I think part of the problem with online commenting is that people can do it anonymously and without fear of reprisal.  If every online comment had to be linked to an identifiable person - so readers could see who they were, who their friends were, where they worked - I think there would be less of a problem with hate speech.
__label__Position	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__Position	Why are we (UK public) so complacent with the government, we seem to just take everything they throw at us without any comeback 
__label__Position	I stand by what I previously said and think that moderating the comment section is the best solution.
__label__Evidence	I agree, if we were to allow the public to have 'freedom of speech' We need to ensure someone who is unbiased can remove the comments that will only fuel hatred and not give a well structured opinion a chance.
__label__Position	Would the removal of comments be classed as removing freedom of speech? Can there ever be a comment section without some form of hate speech/ misinformation being added.
__label__Evidence	100% - they are one and the same. 
__label__Position	Economy, Immigration, 
__label__Evidence	Immigration is out of control
__label__Position	I believe that completing removing the comments section is not the answer, but I do think they should be more moderated so those types of comments are deleted.
__label__Position	climate change is very important issue. we are need more awareness about it. we need to reduce, every one is important to take action.we choice alternative to control like bio gas, electric and solar like...
__label__Position	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__Position	protecting the NHS and addressing the cost of living crisis
__label__Position	One thing that surprised me is that certain people where not really answering the question at hand and they were addressing something different which caused them to miss the point. The priority should be to make user feel safe at all times and make sure that they ca make clear and sound comments without getting hate.
__label__Evidence	this makes no sense. Newspapers are already biased
__label__Position	Should the comment space be removed, it should be evaluated how it will impact the newspapers and the readers. We can agree that what might be view as bad can also be viewed as good on the other perspective. Besides through conversations and other platforms hate speech is still used, trying to reduce it  does not mean it will completely be used in the real world as well such as in the streets or TV.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers should remember they is freedom of speech
__label__Position	We need to increase policy coherence and systemic approaches
__label__Position	How the NHS will be funded, and policies that look at economic growth
__label__Evidence	I agree with this point. Hate speech just spreads more hate among people.
__label__Evidence	this can also be dealt with by having moderators who can filter fake news out/highlight the correct facts and refer to more up to date stories if relevant

__label__Evidence	I agree, this gives people the option to learn from mistakes before handing them a more severe punishment and that would be banning them or removing their comments
__label__Position	Stop sending military support to Israel and work to stop the genocide is Gazza
__label__Evidence	This would completely take away the opportunity for these people who use the comment section to post hate speech.
__label__Evidence	But some publishers are indeed deciding to pre-emptively remove comment sections, whether across the entire site or just for specific articles they expect to lead to problematic comment sections - see some of the links within https://digiday.com/media/comments-sections/
__label__Evidence	I have been. The crime in London is out of hand. Recently mobile theft has increased my friend recently had her phone stolen and anotehr friends car!
__label__Position	It's not fair because it goes against freedom of speech imposed to humanity, however, some comments are rooted with evil purpose to degrade and humiliate the other party. as such, a strict policy on what actually gets published in the comment section should be enforced and any comment that violates it should be removed before it gets published.
__label__Position	To reduce hate speech newspaper websites should employ content moderators who can look out for hate speech and delete it where necessary. This allows for there to still be a comment section for readers to put their opinions in.
__label__Position	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group
__label__Position	When we read comments it can have two effects, one is it changes our initial position, another is it reinforces what we already believe. Because bias confirmation is so strong it's important to decide which capacity is greater, the need for validation or the ability to critically think and be flexible in thinking. Most societies shape people to look for bias confirmation though so in reality the outcome is more frequently people reaffirming what they already believed rather than being swayed by any logic no matter how logical it is.
__label__Evidence	Does not give diversity to the story.
__label__Position	Cost of Living crisis
__label__Position	Some newspapers open comments on only a selection of stories. This limits the burden on moderators and also prevents commenting on topics which are predicted to become unproductive or hateful in some way.
__label__Evidence	News papers might get very restrictive
__label__Position	Social media contribute to reshaping “racist dynamics through their affordances, policies, algorithms and corporate decisions” (Matamoros-Fernández 2018, 933). I believe the social media contributes in hate speech thatis why people who are respectful expressing their opinions should be considered by signing the consent form. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230&ved=2ahUKEwjLpdz4mu_6AhUmgf0HHSRdCdMQFnoECAwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw29vPxYrjcDX7N5Cfya1-UQ

__label__Position	A machine filtering comments would have a positive affect as then people still have the freedom of speech without the vulger and disrespectful language
__label__Evidence	Human bias would still be at the very core of this moderation, but then again humans build algorithims too.
__label__Position	te people that hate speech lead  to people smoking drugs  and it should not be allowed at all
__label__Evidence	Agreed it needs to stop, but the first priority of a UK government should be to improve the lot of its own people. While I agree Israel/Gaza is a horror, our first priority has to be to improve the future for our own children, then focus our energies on helping the less fortunate.

__label__Evidence	The moderation can be subject to the Moderator's own thoughts/opinions.
__label__Position	Violence attributed to online hate speech has increased (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) so this question needs to be answered with increasing demand. Policies to reduce hate speech is ever non-existent or inconsistently enforced. (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) Therefore, I think it's importnant for newspaper platforms to take this responsibility under their own wing. By providing these platforms I believe it is their responsibility to moderate them.
__label__Evidence	very true
__label__Evidence	All we can do is reduce our impact but not reverse it.Unfortunately is statistically inevitable
__label__Position	Hateful comments could be hurtful towards the person/people that the article is about and cause them to become upset and possibly negatively affect their mental health.
__label__Position	I don't actually know what the evidence is about reducing hate speech so I feel unqualified to comment.
__label__Position	Fair treatment/equality for all, cost of living crisis, long-term futures of people including their stability
__label__Evidence	The fact is that the knowledge on climate change is still very limited. Assumptions that we make about the damage today could be disproved tomorrow. Take for example the holes in the Ozone. We discovered them with advances in technology, but no one is really sure that we caused them or even for how long they had actually been there. With advancements in technology there is little reason to believe we can't reverse some of these things.
__label__Position	filtering undesirabled words and employing human mods to check comments
__label__Position	I feel it's important to have freedom of speech and to discuss news responsibly. However, of course there will always be people that use the platform for hate, for spam or just to cause trouble. These discussion columns should be well moderated to ensure no hate speech or other junk gets through.
__label__Evidence	this a would acomment
__label__Position	if we dont pay our doctors and nurses a decent wage then they are going to go elsewhere, we dont have the staff we need now in the hns
__label__Evidence	I think this is a good point. I hadn't thought about moderator bias.
__label__Position	increase the state pension and ring fence it
__label__Evidence	i agree with this. although i believe that freedom of speech and hate speech do not have a visible line. thus someone may be hiding behind the guise of freedom of speech but spewing hate rhetoric.
__label__Evidence	It could reduce the presence of hate.
__label__Evidence	I agree with both of these ideas. Having a moderation means consistency, but having other readers flag comments allows other commenters to hold peers to account and ensure that the comment section is an inclusive and fair section.
__label__Evidence	I agree that hate speech can never be completely eliminated
__label__Position	Against
__label__Evidence	Agreed, this article shares the same views. Its should not be the Newspaper taking accountability
__label__Position	Hate speech allows factors such as race and racism to come into play  https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Position	You can ban some words, that usually helps a lot.
__label__Position	Key factors include ethical point of intervention along with just mere word filtering. Because sometime the message that was thought to be sent across might be pure but because of wrong choices of words, it can get filtered out.
__label__Position	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names.  Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__Evidence	Yes but not all people are intelligent or polite enough, many people really like to hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Need active moderation
__label__Position	Is there any moderation here or do we just keep typing away?
__label__Position	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__Position	Newspapers or magazines should have computer programs which filter out hate speech and then have some people who can remove hate speech which could not be filtered.
__label__Evidence	A legal framework is needed to ensure  that media outlets don't censor speech on the basis that it is opposite to their views, with the justification that it was hate speech.
__label__Position	Yes, because it's not a social media where to express your opinion. It's a service to deliver the news not peoples opinion
__label__Evidence	Good idea as this may deter many who are considering posting hateful comments, although it may not deter the die-hards.
__label__Position	i agree, freedom of speech is our right, as long as its presented in a respectful manner
__label__Evidence	We are out - end of!

__label__Position	Ensuring the NHS remains unprivatised is essential. Having recently spent more time than i would have liked in hospital due to ill family members, my family would be in crippling debt now if not for the NHS. 
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech is important, if we remove comments we remove other perspectives. Not all comments are hate speech
__label__Position	In my opinion,scrapping comments sections is not the best way to go about dealing with the issue(s) around hate speech on news platforms. The sensible thing to do is to monitor comment sections for hate speech in order for it to be removed and the evidence suggests that the public is in support of such measures(https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/),granted the moderators, whether it's a human or AI, remain neutral.
__label__Evidence	Human spoiled the nature to a great extent and they have to face the consequences and should avoid doing more harm to the environment any further.
__label__Evidence	I worry for the future of the NHS and the services that so many of us rely on in times of need
__label__Position	Most seem to agree that there should always be room for comments, with many suggesting the use of moderators and hiding comments. The issue with requiring moderator approval to post comments is it allows the moderator or newspaper to push a certain narrative, as I have seen in many groups on other social media platforms. It is much more useful allowing hateful comments to be confronted allowing a more balanced narrative.
__label__Position	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power. We get all of our news through the spreading of news in social media as seen in this article : https://kettlemag.co.uk/social-media-versus-print-media/
__label__Position	In order to do this I believe comments to be moderated, by people on both sides of the argument. Hate speech accounts should be automatically banned
__label__Position	hate speech shouldnt be eliminated because some mewspaper online post fake news so when people comment whatever they want it helps all of us a freedom of choice
__label__Evidence	although I do think that, however, we should consider how many people do in fact post hateful comments without the protection of anonymity. look at Facebook, for instance - it's absolutely full of hate speech from people posting under their names using accounts that people can view and learn more about them. perhaps if people are truly hateful then being known for this isn't a problem for them after all.
__label__Evidence	But the prisons are full! 
__label__Position	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__Position	protecting my money from labour
__label__Position	I think we should have vigorous ID checks when signing up and being able to comment. People will then be accountable for their actions
__label__Position	I don't feel that climate change is all man made, but we should be doing things to help the earth in general.
__label__Evidence	There is an easy way to increase taxes to fund our public services. The UK has more than doubled the amount of billionaires it has since the pandemic, we just need to tax these people a lot heavier, the top 1 - 5 % could easily fund public services and would not lose too much of their wealth in real terms 
__label__Position	comments should me moniotred without bias, they sould be monitored so that hate speech is removed and those who continue to comment with hate speech should be blocked. other platforms have moderators who have to review and approve comments before they become public
__label__Evidence	I disagree! There could errors in implanting this to begin with and it may discourage them from using it, and therefore these products in general. I feel a dedicated team for tackling this matter or if a smaller company general overseers from time to time would be better and also hold a more human opinion on whether it is deemed hate or not.
__label__Evidence	i think they go together as we have an ageing population we do need some immigration
__label__Position	It could be community moderated. Down vote and hide options if multiple people think it is not appropriate
__label__Position	Lets just apply common sense and filter it a little bit. Filter out the racism and other like offensive matters. What constitutes racism is obvious to a sensible person.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should moderate their comments sections instead of leaving them as a free-for-all.
__label__Evidence	totally agree here, the tories have ruined our good country with so much financial mismanagement
__label__Position	reader comments are important and helpful to many users as well as the newspaper website as it can provide crucial feedback as well as being a place to further discuss relevant topics. it should not be removed but there can be many steps taken to make sure it is void of any harmful or offensive material. for example, using a program to detect and remove comments containing offensive words, or having moderators to manually remove/take disciplinary action against harmful comments and accounts
__label__Position	The more I examine this issue, the more convinced I am that moderation is the key. Often in these situations, one side is coming in specifically to dishonestly represent the facts and in many circumstances, flat out fabricating, I think this article can explain a lot of what I am proposing: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiusKTzsPv6AhXTRMAKHa9vCkQQFnoECC8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fscience%2Fbrain-flapping%2F2014%2Fsep%2F12%2Fcomment-sections-toxic-moderation&usg=AOvVaw0VBlEl0ndsB4s5IMnsHS4I
__label__Evidence	Seems a cost efficient way.
__label__Evidence	Re-educating is key to reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	Weapons automatization
__label__Position	I don't think there is one solution that is going to solve the problem, there will always be people who are going to intentionally use hate speech, whether you re-educate or prove otherwise.
__label__Position	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__Position	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__Position	i think by just censoring specific words that are hateful/derogatory this could then automically screen out hateful comments that are abusive - i think it should be judged on what would be an offense to say in person. This could then use humans to read and monitor comment boards and then train AI to further do so
__label__Position	I think newspapers websites should introduce a bot that would delete automatically all posts that have too many hate words in it.
__label__Position	It is clear that there is a shortage of skilled traders both on retrofit and clean energy. People wishing to install new systems talk about long waiting lists. This is an issue for new build as well as retrofit, and training is obviously a key issue. The new Green Construction Skills Centre at Witney and Abingdon College may help with this – will their courses engage with the heritage agenda?  But should we be looking at other aspects of the skills gap? We need to ensure that planning officers and councillors on planning committees understand the implications of the UK net zero target and the councils’ own climate action plans. Building managers will also need to skill up on new technologies and climate professionals and volunteer activists will need to build their understanding of the frameworks around heritage preservation in Oxford. 
__label__Position	we should try to make the number of words a person can use to respond because usually people wit hate hate speech write long responses
__label__Evidence	"Yes most of them are career politicians and never had a ""real"" job outside of politics "
__label__Position	by rigorous moderating of the comments section or by implementing a bot that flags key hate words
__label__Evidence	Reduced aggression could lead to less retaliation. If an idea/thought is presented in a balanced way, then a respondent may hopefully be inclined to respond accordingly.
__label__Position	Reducing hate speech needs to be a priority. We need to teach people how to express their opinions effectively without reverting to hate speech, we need to educate on the extent of the hurt hate speech brings and the trauma it is often derived from. Education is key and allows people to debate and disagree with respect, those who cannot do this should be removed or monitored from sites
__label__Position	There can be a filtering system that filters hate speech
__label__Position	Comments sections are necessary, but need moderation.
__label__Evidence	But will that be effective?
__label__Evidence	people should be able to have an opinion, but without monitoring people would be offended all the time and thing could escalate very quickly.

__label__Evidence	I agree, having it flagged and hidden until review is fair. If the comments section has clear rules then its easy to moderate if a comment broke them or not instead of it being subjective or based on opinion
__label__Evidence	I feel like this would be the mos t ideal solution.
__label__Evidence	I think the comment section is a good space for people to interact with the author instead of removing they should create or have an inbuilt AI that identifies bad words and mark the post as bad

__label__Evidence	I don't agree. This would infringe on free speech. Rather have guidelines and censor any comments that promote hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I disagree. I think other readers of hate speech could be influenced by it making the issue spread even further. You can share your opinions without using hate speech and with a balanced approach so it should be removed.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	Then we would need different names for animals, pets, and plants too. It would be ridiculous!

__label__Evidence	Who was in charge of planning for things like pandemics and took their eye completely off the ball? The lack of planning is astounding.
__label__Position	I think that keeping a comment section is overall good as it keeps engagement but needs to be heavily moderated and regulated so it doesn't just dissolve into a lot of hate speech and grounds for radicalisation
__label__Position	What takes place tomorow with be political theatre, the real power lies with the banks and financial istitutions. In order for there to be any real change we need a new financial system which is not a  debt slave fiat one
__label__Position	people will always have something foul to say. it is not really practical for one to stop people from hate speech. however I think if maybe there is a clear message before commenting that notify people about the implications of hate speech... also if an automated word detecter can be implemented to pick up certain words that are considered hate speech can assist in making sure that people do not write any hate speech on the comment section.
__label__Position	tactical voting to remove the conservatives, the decline of social services support from the government NHS, education, youth support, housing, cost of living crisis, transport, constant mis truths, people in power not being held accountable
__label__Position	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__Evidence	I hope there will be prosecutions for the damage caused by the water companies due to greed, but I sadly, very much doubt there will be. 
__label__Evidence	Even with human moderators it still comes down to personal preference. There is no person alive who doesn't have ANY biases. what one human moderator might deem acceptable language another might not. Therefore, even human moderation isn't 100% accurate and failsafe.
__label__Evidence	while you cant express yourself on that post doesnt mean you cant be open in other places where may be more appropriated
__label__Evidence	Issue with time and who gets priority for arguments
__label__Evidence	Absolutely, the issue of sharing inflammatory or misleading news is important to address and change. News outlets are responsible for how they present their stories and how the narrative changes in the comment section below. They're also responsible for the real world violence as a result of willingly hosting hate speech on their platform whether they're active or inactive on their handling of the comments sections.
__label__Evidence	Not it's not, but I'd rather take a gamble on the other option than vote in who have shown themselves to be awful for the past 14 years
__label__Position	immigration, law and order
__label__Evidence	they do have clear strategies, all the conservatives care about is that people dont vote labour
__label__Evidence	Higher food prices could negatively impact consumers
__label__Evidence	I agree completely. I argue that it is not up to the newspaper websites to police such discussion and that comments only harm the neutral perspective that they offer. There are plenty of other discussion platforms  #like Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter, where such discussions could take place and where other users have the power to moderate the community opinion themselves.

__label__Evidence	Eliminating the space for comments entirely will mean that each article is viewed through the lens of the journalist. This is not completely impartial but it does mean that harmful speech or radicalised opinions aren't present to muddy the waters

__label__Evidence	yes! This is exactly what i said
__label__Position	Public service cuts are affecting us all and doing untold damage to the country. I want investment in our public services even if it means that taxes go up as this will only help us out in the long term if managed efectively
__label__Position	totally agree!
__label__Evidence	"I agree and disagree, how do you educate someone who intentionally tries to misunderstand you because it doesn't support their current views"". But why give up entirely just because the odds are stacked against you for effectively swaying them from hateful thoughts. I think the better question is how do you sway someone who is firmly attached to hate speech? And how can we teach the people who care about human rights to talk to the less reasonable hate speech people in a way that penetrates their firmly held belief systems?"
__label__Evidence	I definitely agree
__label__Evidence	Sorry this one was too
__label__Evidence	thats the bad outake as they will sell the information they want without any way for it to be debated
__label__Evidence	social assets and emotional relationships from the people who leave in the properties are really relevant to the problem
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Position	I agree with this.
__label__Evidence	There is a lot of discord currently within the country, conservative have had time but a change is needed. 
__label__Evidence	I can agree with this as Newspapers are not government or public services, they are companies trying to sell newspapers and subscriptions to their services for profit, the comments sections are there to bring more revenue into the company and keep more people logged in and using their websites
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

__label__Evidence	Yes, I agree, needs more funding and better rights for NHS workers including those that come from overseas
__label__Position	There need to be some kind of moderation, either before or after comments are published
__label__Evidence	I get your sentiment, but this is hardly practical!  What do you think would happen to an already buggered economy if that happened?
__label__Evidence	Sometimes newspapers are very skewed and/or publish incorrect information. This approach would make it harder for people to question facts and stats/the content provided.
__label__Position	Governments do not want to give up control of what makes them rich and fossil fuels make many governments trillions of dollars. If you think they will give up this cash in favor of climate control you are sadly mistaken. As long as money means power we are doomed AND THE POOR WILL BE THE FIRST TO SUFFER.
__label__Position	spending time trying to edit out the comment section might also be costly for the newspaper when they could spend that time and effort doing something else.
__label__Position	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__Position	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__Position	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely.  I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech is important but it's important we use it in the correct way. If what we are saying results in bullying then that should be shutdown.
__label__Position	i think i good to create a program that can detect key words that used in hate speech.

__label__Position	AI can help us advance our technology 
__label__Position	I dont think it is a fair choice.  For how long should people be silenced.  Hate speech is always going to be around.  Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree everyone should be able to express their point of view
__label__Position	People can express them selves however they like but they must be mindful to their language.
__label__Position	Have a system that flags hate speech slurs, and then have a person or system review those comments and either allow them or remove them
__label__Position	There must be one day lock down for every month to maintain the pollution which we are experiencing through lock down for corona
__label__Evidence	I think when there are professionals they can be balanced and have training alongside guidelines which can help guide what is and is not allowed
__label__Evidence	Without the use of id and controls to set up acounts, people once banned will just create new accounts.
__label__Evidence	If newspapers did not allow interaction and went back to old school 1 way news, they would die out, nobody uses that anynore
__label__Evidence	Young people can be eliminated, who are likely to hate speech because of lack of information.
__label__Position	Do we all agree that the cost of living is the biggest issue right now?
__label__Evidence	While yes we should all be able to communicate freely, with the anonymity of the internet internet trolls go too easily unpunished and their actions not removed
__label__Position	JosephM, Everyone has the right to freedom of speech, so cancelling the comment space prohibts one of such. I believe the comment should be removed if it contains hate speech.
__label__Position	Could there be some coding introduced to remove foul language before it's even posted?
__label__Evidence	People could just as easily reward negative and hateful comments if they agree with them
__label__Position	My position is that i think they should not be removed, but moderated
__label__Position	By allowing a section that briefly educates the viewers regarding the situation before they even get to the part of comment sections.
__label__Evidence	That seems very authoritative and draconic.
__label__Evidence	Negative thought. I disagree. any effort will definitely make a difference. If hate speech is not monitored at all, racists and narcissistic people tend to grow and get away with so much
__label__Evidence	When your beliefs are entwined with your identity, changing your mind means changing your identity. That’s really hard for most people.
__label__Position	Economy (cost of living), immigration, NHS
__label__Position	Are we done now? It said 20 minutes and it's ground to a halt anyway
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech should never be taken away.
__label__Evidence	Most people are for comments on new articles as it makes them feel like they have a voice as evidenced by this article
__label__Evidence	i agree, the cost of living is a big issue that needs to be addressed 
__label__Position	This is not fair as it infringes with the freedom of speech and could have negative outcome. The best way to goabout this is to have a policy to approve comments before they are posted
__label__Evidence	should be stop violence against all. not just one group.
__label__Position	I know the conservatives have been awful over the last 14 years but it seems people have forgotten how much worse previous Labour governments have been 
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I understand the offer for newspaper websites to not have a comments section as it would mean that there is absolutely no chance for hate speech, using AI is a good suggestion to automatically remove certain words but how can this ensure all hate comments are removed. Perhaps AI monitoring could be used and then have people to also check them
__label__Position	I think that what we can do at this point is to raise awareness on the issue of hate speech and what it can do to people online or offline.
__label__Position	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	the bare minimum should be to taper the way carers allowance is paid - it is a pittance for what it is and to have a defined cut off is crippling

__label__Position	I think it is important that we put more finances in dementia research
__label__Position	The pros are that it would lead to less people responding to comments negatively
__label__Evidence	 I think that the human capital to employe human vetting would not be sufficient in a first filtering phase
__label__Position	report comment buttons could be useful but there should be monitors that check comments before they are allowed to be posted
__label__Position	NHS waiting lists
__label__Position	I strongly believe is free speech and allowing people for exchanging their thoughts. However I do also believe that this is  the responsibility of the platform to allow for free exchange of thoughts in a way that is safe for the participants. This could be done by introducing moderation and stipulation of a clear rules of enagment
__label__Position	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.
__label__Position	I think the best thing for people to right now is to reduce or eliminate their consumption of products that contribute to climate change. That way even if there is not a solution to totally reverse it, at least it will not progress as fast.
__label__Evidence	They may edit out valid non hateful comments that are just not their views
__label__Position	I am not sure that newspaper websites need a comment section. The principle of commenting on the Internet is often one of each person giving their opinion without caring for the opinions of other. There could be the same problems as seen on social media and how it polarizes or amplifies opinions out of proportions, loosing the idea of dialogue and just creating echo chambers. https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115
__label__Position	Billionaires who make money by killing planet earth, should be shot to death. They are not understanding what they are doing. Their aim is only money.
__label__Position	i do not think hate speech can be eliminated completely however i believe with perhaps moderators, it may help to be a less negative space.
__label__Position	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.
__label__Position	we need a just country with respect for human rights and transparency!
__label__Position	Another way of dealing with the hate speech without removing the comments section is by asking the moderator or admin to remove the comment once you as a reader see it. https://www.unia.be/en/areas-of-action/media-and-internet/internet/how-to-deal-with-hate-speech
__label__Evidence	You don't need to vote tactically, the Tories are finished so why not vote for the party that comes closest to your views?
__label__Position	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__Position	I think it can be reversed, but it's going to take a collective effort from a lot of individuals to start this process.
__label__Position	i do not like the labour leadership
__label__Evidence	No censoring of  opinions
__label__Position	this is an example of how one country chose to deal with combating hate comments without infringing on the freedom of speech- by imposing a bill where a person can be sentenced accordingly
__label__Evidence	This is a great approach that requires public funding too, to avoid wrong retro-fit choices to be made in heritage sites.
__label__Evidence	regardless of the nuance in hate speech, a platform can still manage it effectively using the laid out definitions but also can fill some of the gap by having a wider language policy that also includes the use of threatening and aggressive language
__label__Evidence	I think that would be good
__label__Evidence	I agree, the Tory Gov has almost destroyed the NHS.  
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	I think that the most position that suprissed me was a person agreeing that that hate speech should be allowed. How  can that be allowed when it can be a problem on people's mental health? I think that moderating the comment section to approve comments should be prioritised.Some posts would need more attention and be looked at carefuly.
__label__Position	Filter the comments and leave the positive ones.
__label__Position	You can not, everybody should be able to make comments you can't shut yourself off from society.
__label__Evidence	There are now 4 pillars of sustainability, rather than 3. Culture was added as the 4th pillar - and this includes heritage (Nigel Griffiths) 
__label__Position	Important to balance free speech with the rights of the individual and groups. A problem is that hate speech is often subjective, and debate is needed to explore the real underlying issue. Currently a lot og groups cry hate speech when it is just a different opinion or badly expressed point with no hate intended.
__label__Evidence	I also don't think the removal of a comments section will make them take further, alternative action.
__label__Position	Newspapers could censor certain words that are deemed hateful. This could be done automatically.
__label__Position	We can hire a moderator to also monitor the comments because sometimes hate speech is not in English.
__label__Position	Building trust through effective listening and engagement is key to reducing polarization
__label__Evidence	extreme is also an apinion as long as it isnt damaging or offensive 
__label__Evidence	none
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is a right but the right should not be violated
__label__Evidence	"Newspapers in general typically should not be open for comment sections , it is the opinion of that set newspaper. Also its easy to throw the word ""Algorithm"" around with not knowing the technology behind it."
__label__Evidence	I agree that Comments should we posted then flagged by the public. If it has a certain number of flags it should then be reviewed. This is good as it is up to the public if they find a comment to be hate speech and t is not just up to one person as people have issues being impartial. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/alternative-truths/201006/the-persistent-illusion-impartiality
__label__Evidence	"imagine if we'd said ""not our problem"" during WWII. What is going on is the world's problem "
__label__Position	Comments that containing words that are to be regarded as hate speech should be flagged as having words that contain hate speech and the reader can choose to view the comment or continue without seeing the details of the flagged comment
__label__Position	Comments are important as they allow other people to express their views but at the same time it can be a problem when we have to deal with inconsiderate individuals.
__label__Position	"""How upgraded/comfortable should we make historic buildings?"" (Kerry Mashford) "
__label__Position	We should not allow newspaper websites to be moderated as this will lead to censorship and bias. It is possible that the moderators will let their own believes and preferences influence the decisions that they make and that could mean that people are unfairly censored.  Look at this study from Germany, for example: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Evidence	Yes, I agree and they seem to think that we all want tax reductions when I would ather the money was spent on helping the NHS, etc get back on its feet.
__label__Position	The options users have, the rules commenters are obliged to follow, and the moderation regime they confront, could influence the quantity and quality of comments. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2014.899758?cookieSet=1
__label__Position	Also, it is always better to do something than nothing, and then regretting it. 
__label__Evidence	I  think that would be unfair to other people who do not post hate speech.
__label__Evidence	"In addition it would be helpful for there to be some form of data tracking to identify ""repeat offender'who go around spreading  hate speech consistently."
__label__Position	Medium security algorithms can flag the words most commonly used for hate speech, humans will have to update as it progresses because once communities recognize they're banned they come up with work around words using symbols, spaces or whole new words.
__label__Position	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__Evidence	Definitely true.
__label__Evidence	completely agree
__label__Position	Removing the comment space from online newspapers is definitely not fair but I believe that it should be regulated by A-I. This way readers could share different opinions and thoughts abut the topic at hand without offending one another.
__label__Position	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__Evidence	I agree - a much more coherent strategy is needed 
__label__Evidence	glad the numbers are low. also you have to blame the voters for not doing their research and supporting idiots 
__label__Position	Based on this thread, most people disagree with the statement so there should be some form of intervention to improve problems with hate speech. I think a fair way is hard to decide on because there are different issues with freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Have a seperate space for readers to contribe views and opinions.  Not linked to the article.  This would reduce hate speech
__label__Evidence	when regulating the comments someone will always disagree or challenge the rules. Claim free speech has gone mad etc.
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Position	Ending faith schools, all of them. Schools are to teach facts, homes and religious places can do the other stuff.
__label__Position	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.

__label__Evidence	We cannot invest trillions in an attempt to reverse climate change, without first knowing that is possible, manageable and achievable in a reasonable amount of time
__label__Evidence	Already we are ruin the nature to observe the CO2 and other gases.Now we are expecting the solution in technology side.It is not fully solution for change the climate.So we want to focus the nature resources management.

__label__Evidence	Hate speech should not be tolerated and is a misuse of freedom of speech toward a goal that does not serve to benefit anyone
__label__Position	I think the people should be given a choice whether or not they would like the comment section removes because they are the ones reading the news paper.
__label__Evidence	They should still be responsible for their words, as they are adults, so surely they know what they are doing.
__label__Position	One of the key issues for me focussing on long-term issues such as our environment
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, and it is all of our jobs to try to stop it.
__label__Position	MArginsand borders should be created that give opportunity to speak out negative feelings but this speach should not be aggressive and violent else the system should remove inappropriate messages from the database automaticly
__label__Evidence	removing the comment section will drive traffic away and decrease the amount of time readers engage with the newspaper.
__label__Position	NHS, environment, climate, care, education and corruption
__label__Evidence	I don't really plan to vote either. I'd have no idea who to vote for. And not neccessairly because i dont follow politics, but because no matter who I vote for, they are all the same. Yeah they promise different things , but when they have the power they'll do absolutely nothing. 
__label__Evidence	this literally achieves nothing
__label__Evidence	Yes, absolutely. 
__label__Position	use an algorithm to filter out words such as slurs and offensive phrases but also have a person who's looks over the comment in order to make sure they comply with hate speech legislation
__label__Evidence	good idea but you nead the right person with a good moral compass on board,to give a level playing field for all.
__label__Evidence	The conservatives have had 14 years in power, and 5 elections, this is not jumping ship, this is an attempt to fix the problems they have caused 
__label__Position	by having it monitored and removing hate speech at source
__label__Position	All in all, we'd need to define hate speech, offensive comments/topics, problematic/controversial themes and messages/keywords. Then, we can think about the implementation of guidelines, bans, filters and moderators.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this, or some coding introduced in the background somehow to not even allow bad comments/words to be posted at all.
__label__Evidence	The state of the health service is one of the biggest problems we have, and the NHS one of our biggest assets (despite the problems with its running). It's being dismantled and I think regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, most of the public would fight to save it.
__label__Position	National Security and the armed forces, gotta stop people like Putin from walking into countries and just killing for the sake of land grab
__label__Evidence	While I agree, there are many ways in which these auto-moderation technologies can be bypassed. https://newmediaservices.com.au/9-ways-to-bypass-auto-moderation/
__label__Position	I do not think comment sections should be completely eliminated, however they should be regularly monitored and certain words could be blocked from the comments to reduce hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I also think these should be monitored to a certain degree because hurtful comments can't be out there like they are currently
__label__Position	I think the best bet for reducing hate speech is by moderation. Either be it an actual person or AI. Completely removing comment sections seems like an infringement on freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Some people with genuine or kind comments may be put off interacting
__label__Evidence	This removes balanced media consumption (people will get even more stuck in echo chambers!) and the idea of free-press means that there should be freedom to cross-examine
__label__Position	how the economy can be improved and also the nhs
__label__Evidence	At the same time, people have a right to comment and discuss - the more we engage with difficult topics and debate, the more we practice our critical thinking, and I think we owe the average commenter more credit than thinking they can't differentiate between opinion and fact.
__label__Evidence	right
__label__Position	The rewspaper must always go thourough the content which reader are confotable with and try not to capture words which promote hate speech

__label__Evidence	https://www.unia.be/en/areas-of-action/media-and-internet/internet/how-to-deal-with-hate-speech
__label__Position	I think with the modern technology it's possible to find a common ground between not allowing any comment spaces and wild-west commentary. Hate Speech and the upholding of free speech is an shakey equilibrium. Certainly, the news outlets are in a special position in this case.
__label__Position	reform the media. MSM should not be owned by foreign nationals. Make disinformation in the media an offence
__label__Position	Social media and AI have positive impacts on society
__label__Evidence	upholds freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	But how the the average person avoid these companies big expensive ideas when they are just about making ends meet now?
__label__Position	The Liberals, Conservatives and the Lib Dems are basically all the same Uniparty.  I don't expect anything to change.  It is hard to see how things could get any worse but  as usually the pliticians won't let  us down. lol
__label__Evidence	Being open to the voice of the opposition means that we can hear another side of the argument
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal 
__label__Evidence	"BASED ON: ""And the major unions agree on an interoperability standard for their knowledge. Uh, for for for their consensus building platforms."", Person24 ""Yes. Because the point is that we need the.We need new ways to organize intermediaries.Because intermediaries have been dissolved by technology."", Person24 "
__label__Position	Having reflected and read some other's opinions, I wonder if not having comments on newspaper websites would just draw the extreme and hateful comments to other places. Maybe it is better on newspaper websites where it can be moderated!
__label__Position	More effort is needed to raise the awareness in humans.If else the climate change cause the humans lives matter.Future decades will damaged by climate change. 
__label__Evidence	i agree that if people are going to use social media they need to expect hate
__label__Position	Moderate the comments sections!
__label__Position	i totally agree
__label__Position	followed by the general incompetence of all or any governments to deal with the problems
__label__Position	Keep the comment space, and filter or censor explicit words.
__label__Position	Education is the most effective way to curb hate speech by removing the underlying causes of hate speech in the first place. This is according to the United Nations strategy on prevention of hate speech. More can be found at this link: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/un-strategy-and-plan-of-action-on-hate-speech
__label__Evidence	The right to free speech doesn't mean there are no consequences for hate speech. Tolerating hate speech is not going to make it go away.
__label__Evidence	We have too many human rights 
__label__Evidence	Consideration for ALL not just one part of society 
__label__Position	Healthcare is very important. The NHS is failing.
__label__Evidence	I believe ALL websites with ANY content are responsible for the messages their content conveys - be it articles, podcasts, videos or comments.
__label__Evidence	removing the comment section is a solution for avoiding hate speech, it's just whether people agree with it being removed.
__label__Position	i am not sure if this is recording what i say
__label__Evidence	I don't think that simply mitigating the problem should be our focus.
__label__Evidence	I like this becuase 
__label__Evidence	I agree 
__label__Evidence	Whether or not it is a hoax, human having rational thinking he have the guilty when he affect the environment with pollution like fumes, industrial wastes and other things damaging the society.
__label__Evidence	The world is changing in terms of human empowerment and the connectedness of the individual and the transparency of the powers that be. The opinions of the people CAN be heard and change is possible. Humanity needs to work together and gain strength from one another. 
__label__Position	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__Position	Improving the NHS, No increases to taxes, wasteful public services spending
__label__Evidence	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Agree that climate change is a massive challenge and no parties are doing enough to combat it] 
__label__Evidence	Increase the numbers working in HMRC on tax avoidance on high value tax payers will increase the take substantially  
__label__Position	The comment section should have a filter and a down rating for comments that promote hate speech.
__label__Position	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Evidence	would require more than 1 moderator
__label__Position	I am not sure you can fairly reduce hate speech without completely removing the comments space.  Or you will have to have someone monitoring every single comment made to make sure it is not hateful.  Unfortunately all speech is free speech, we just might not like what is being said.
__label__Evidence	there is a distinction between comments that are made directly in a discriminative way and comments that create a dialogue.
__label__Position	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__Position	Although free speech is important, this paper highlights the difficulties and tension of balancing the expression of ideas and healthy debate with the legal and moral ramifications of allowing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Adaptation and fighting climate change often go hand in hand
__label__Evidence	this would be very difficult to police, although i do think its a good starting point
__label__Position	I also would like to add that, as mentioned here, if there is no agreement in how to flag comments with hate speech, probably deleting the comment section would be better than leaving it. As can be shown on this article from The Guardian people in general associate the comment section as toxic https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	I strongly believe that removing the readers' comment space will be depriving readers of expressing themselves, hence stopping freedom of speech. Imagine if you saw something about yourself in the newspaper that was totally incorrect, would you let that slide? I want to be able to comment on everyday things but I'm not for hate speech. That means that there needs to be some monitoring that has to be made.
__label__Position	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__Evidence	the issue with an algorithm is that is isnt able to sympathise with news. yes it is good to filter out bad words but i think hate speech can be relative to the user digesting that information
__label__Position	The comments section may be removed on especially conflicting topics/conversations.
__label__Position	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comment are added to the website
__label__Position	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.
__label__Position	thats a good idea
__label__Evidence	Dialogue alone doesn t lead to action or policy changes
__label__Evidence	Settlements are illegal under international law and undermine the two-state solution
__label__Position	We can do so by filtering keywords that are associated with hate speech.
__label__Position	a post here was removed quickly for hate speech so clearly moderation here works an is benefitial
__label__Position	I think allowing some special space to allow it also would be helpful instead of cutting comments off.
__label__Evidence	How do people exercise freedom of speech?
__label__Evidence	I don't know who your party is, but if they have changed, why do you feel you owe them loyalty?  They probably aren't the same as they were say 20 years ago 
__label__Evidence	A moderating team might work but it could also be hard to revise every comment, specially is the newspaper is popular
__label__Position	By having a system that detects bad or hate speech comments
__label__Evidence	no way should we be privatising the nhs 
__label__Evidence	We need to spend the money we send to Ukraine on our services here. 
__label__Evidence	Should reduce hate speech and other inappropriate comments
__label__Position	Managing the economy
__label__Evidence	Nothing will change. It never does
__label__Evidence	Yes, they can deeply hurt anyone's internal peace
__label__Evidence	people will be deterred to rely on information on newspapers if there are no guidelines regulating hate speech
__label__Evidence	Agree, public sector has been destroyed by this government.
__label__Evidence	To many managers costing money
__label__Position	"Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech. ""Fight back against harmful messages in public places by publicly standing with victims in solidarity"" https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-onlin-hate-speech/"
__label__Evidence	A rights-based argument in this case would also need to consider that protection from discrimination is also a fundamental human right. Hate speech, even if a form of freedom of expression, still infringes on this. The ECRI goes into this in more detail at: https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence
__label__Position	Labour's plan to tax private education will backfire. Smaller private schools will be destroyed and the state will have an extra burden to build new schools and employ teachers, and this will outweigh the money they get from the VAT..
__label__Evidence	The problem with AI is that it lacks morality, thus it can be exploited for other and selfish reasons.
__label__Evidence	I agree this is one of the biggest issues currently. It is creating a bigger rich-poor divide also..
__label__Evidence	"""Willingness to engage with the heritage of the building"" (Esther Robinson Wild)"
__label__Evidence	yes, rich are rewarded at the moment 
__label__Position	Overall, the comment section is a very critical part of a news paper website. Putting measures in place to allow fair and commenting for the users will help a lot and it will also boost the websites traffic as people will know that the website is safe for people to engage without receiving hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	this already exists on certain websites and you can still easily view hateful comments
__label__Position	Brexit, NHS and immigration
__label__Evidence	Finding common ground on desired outcomes can bridge divides
__label__Evidence	We should not exclude any segments of the population from communication efforts
__label__Evidence	Completely agree! 
__label__Evidence	the problem is that people are not happy and that has a reason
__label__Evidence	Completely agree with this! Both by human moderator and maybe AI to help identifying and flagging posts that could contain hate speech based on keywords.
__label__Position	I very much have struggled on how to vote, I want to make sure that the Conservatives are voted out,   and therefore it is probably best to  vote Labour however I don't agree with all there policies. Therefore it would be better to vote for Green otr Lib Dems however it is unlikely that they will get in power and I don't want to waste my vote. 
__label__Evidence	This would be costly in terms of time and manpower.
__label__Position	Collective ownership
__label__Evidence	Living Crisis????? I think you need to have a look elsewhere for that. How about people earning 2 Euros an hour in Italy? How does that Compare to people in the UK being Guaranteed a minimum of 13 Euros?
__label__Evidence	yes eliminate them and stop all comments that could offend people
__label__Position	Whatever the decision may be, the law and freedom of speech needs to be considered
__label__Evidence	It can mean different things to different people, but there are also laws referring to hate speech which define it, albeit not always very clearly
__label__Position	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__Position	I believe in an element of balance. Comment spaces should be available to maintain the opportunity for debate and opinion. However, hate speech and bullying should not be tolerated by publications. Moderators should be in place alongside fair 'flagging' systems allowing readers to highlight comments of concern. This could also be used for debates between those commenting, as these can often turn personal.
__label__Position	Iam also concerned about the rising cost of living, everything is going up, income doesn't match
__label__Position	My position is that comments should be allowed and not taken too seriously, although if someone replies to a comments, it is probably to point out an error.
__label__Position	Government needs to talk to those tant work in the NHS, talk to the real workers not the upper management, they are government puppets
__label__Evidence	I agree - the NHS has been wrecked by the present Government and is being privatised by stealth to the detriment of the NHS
__label__Evidence	yes i argree with this. it would not show that the newspaper is biased by leaving the positive comments only
__label__Position	Without the comment section it would be hard to engage and interact with different kinds of people in different parts of the world. Its important to learn in all kinds of way. Free speech is a RIGHT.
__label__Evidence	yesss I agree
__label__Evidence	it is not something i considered for voting tbh
__label__Position	It seems this remains a diffcult question, with varying responses on the subject
__label__Position	NHS, Immigration, policing numbers and our skilled armed forces
__label__Evidence	Immigration is not the cause of problems in this country, just blamed by politicians and the media 
__label__Evidence	Crimes are often blamed on Gypsies in thge Uk but they are referred to wusing other terms. Eg people who tarmac your drive and other stereotyped roles
__label__Position	Implement participatory budgeting at the EU level
__label__Position	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__Evidence	Having an algorithm do the work will inevitably lead to false positives and will also lead to culprits re-tooling their speech to skirt around the algorithm's 'rules'.
__label__Evidence	the mods could be outweighed due to the content volume
__label__Position	AI can help us advance our technology
__label__Evidence	Allows space for other perspectives to be published.
__label__Position	people should be given the platform to comment but also be given selected and limited words to do so
__label__Evidence	I simply do not agree with your views Andrea. How can anyone living, or wanting to live in a democratic world want to actively curtail free speech in any form. I have done a little online research tonight and it seems my argument can be backed up by various articles and sources. Such as this one  https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Position	Deliberative democracy necessitates respectful, transparent, and educational debates. 
__label__Evidence	Agreed. Education is so important, without education I know I and some of my friends would not be as understanding about others, it is a really important part of life and being able to be educated is a major step to stopping this.
__label__Position	I am skeptical of man-made climate change. To answer the prompt I would say yes, it is possible to balance it out. I am not sure what reversing it means. Our planet adapts to climate changes over time. It always has. During the time of the dinosaurs the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere was greater than it is today. Earth's climate will always change. Mother nature has the ability to adapt.
__label__Position	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__Position	Ai and human moderation combined could combat a fair amount of hate speech  https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/research-policy/internet-suicide/guidelines-tech-industry/effective-content-moderation/
__label__Evidence	i agree, its nice to see different opinions on different subject, different perspectives from community.
__label__Position	i am deeply concerned about the cost of living , empty promises over the past decade .
__label__Evidence	It's a nice idea but requires a lot of investment to write the counterarguments. How do we ensure that time is worthwhile and the responses will even be effective?
__label__Position	After reading of many comments my position remains largely the same. However, I do concede that it is difficult knowing where to draw the line between reasonable and unreasonable forms of censorship. To counteract this, I believe websites should have to be really transparent about what types of comments they do and don't allow on their platform and why.
__label__Position	We need a change in government quite crucially, I would like more money for the NHS and people to be taxed fairly, for example those who earn more are taxed more over a certain amount of  earnings 
__label__Evidence	yup. we're doomed. if you think the Tories are incompetent, wait until you see David Lammy and Angela Rayner trying to run things.
__label__Evidence	Yes, people need to be held acountable for their actions.
__label__Evidence	Major societal changes that will impact on all members of society are needed if we are to tackle climate change. Government, local councils, businesses, community and environmental organisations are all going to have to set targets and make difficult decisions. We need to ensure that there is active support for these changes from all parts of society.  
__label__Evidence	C'est la construction en elle même qui produit du gaz à effet de serre. Que les voiture soient électrique ou qu'elles roulent avec du pétrole ne change rien.
__label__Position	immigration and the NHS are my main concerns
__label__Position	hate speech is good
__label__Position	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__Position	"Defining ""hate"" speech is difficult.  A good starting point is The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (summarised on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_the_United_Kingdom  ) but I would strongly suggest looking at the original source in English Law."
__label__Position	Who do people want into power this term?
__label__Evidence	Too many people might find it offensive and may be sensitive to the article and therefore take 'opinions' more personally.
__label__Position	I'm looking for someone whose priorities are more in people than the environment; who undestands an age group that is beyond the demands of 'youth
__label__Position	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__Position	fear of labour
__label__Position	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__Position	In all reality a troll and hate speech will always find its way into civil conversations and areas. The best would be to remove the ability from areas where sensitive people can avoid it.
__label__Evidence	The numbers are unimagineable. I think some legal migration is fine with skilled workers etc., but the numbers of lllegal immigration are out of control 
__label__Evidence	It is important that views are challenged and there is a forum to do that in
__label__Position	Education on media ethics, regulation of social media and multicultural campaigns can help curb hate speech. UNESCO cites this based on their research as found at this link: https://en.unesco.org/5-ways-to-counter-hate-speech
__label__Evidence	I think the autor should have some saying if she/he likes the comment.
__label__Position	The environment and climate change policies
__label__Evidence	You need to have professionals with the understanding, knowledge and skills to help owners of traditional buildings. (John Preston)
__label__Position	I believe that all types of hate speech should be removed. All comments should be pre assessed by an overlooked before comments are posted. We should still be able to comment and have freedom of speach to express an opinion, but no hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Removes possibility to have conversations which help move us forward
__label__Evidence	But many people who want to work aren't able to because they have conditions that would be treatable but massive NHS backlogs have stopped them getting the help they need
__label__Evidence	I guess this works. However, people tend to find other ways to spread hate
__label__Evidence	I want to see the opinion. Say no to the spanish inquisition
__label__Position	After some thinking I have come up with suggestions to improve the comment section from newspapers without removing them entirely. 1) Include a rules section for commenters to abide by and agree to before commenting, such as keep opinions courteous and don't instigate a fight. 2) Comments are not automatically submitted. Before shown to the public moderators will review them, make sure they follow the rules previously posted and - if so - publish them for all to see.
__label__Position	not having it mandatory for our children to go to war
__label__Evidence	in theory sounds good but wealthy people like James Dyson employ hundreds of thousands of people. They can choose to take their businesses to other countries if taxes are too high, so all those jobs are lost 
__label__Evidence	This may work
__label__Position	Don't waste yor vote, vote tactically for the party best placed to beat the Tories. You can find info on this online. A lot of seats where LDs are 2nd
__label__Position	Using moderators helps to remove hateful speech.
__label__Position	Billionaires who make money by killing planet earth, should be shot to death. They are not understanding what they are doing. Their aim is only money. 
__label__Position	I agree I lost my Mum and we were forced to stand just at the graveside only 9 of us to say goodbye while they were breaking al the rules
__label__Evidence	"This an argument that I agree with. I do not believe there is a consensus and I have little confidence in the ""science"" that supports man's heavy influence on climate change. I believe a lot is hysteria used to socially engineer behavior. I also believe a lot of hubris and ego has contributed to this doomsday theory. The leftist talking point last year was we have only 12 years left before we are all dead due to climate change. That is utter nonsense."
__label__Evidence	You give for granted that the automatic is half stupid and the human is a well intentioned agent
__label__Position	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Position	How parties intend to tackle economy issues.
__label__Position	Hate speech will forever be a problem in society and its up to the newspapers website to make sure they publish newsworthy news that even if they come across negative comments, they know that on their side their story is true and there a no loopholes
__label__Evidence	why not?
__label__Evidence	A lot of thorny issues there. It's possible that the Putin-Ukraine situation could escalate, and if so, that really becomes the most important thing of all.
__label__Evidence	Somewhat agree with this statement. The marginalised are oftentimes the focus of hate.
__label__Evidence	people can no longer criticise
__label__Position	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__Evidence	i agreed it. because this is only by our hand to protect our planet from this climate change issue. so we have to should use green energy sources only in future.
__label__Evidence	All the environment benefits can be achieved just by a vegetarian diet, you don't have to go fully vegan 
__label__Evidence	"https://diverseminds.co.uk/hatecrime/ - As much as you say this the effects of hate crime on an individual are not anything that should be allowed to flourish. If newspapers where to physically allow and endorse this type of ""free speech"" on their platform they simply shouldn't be able to have a platform. It also gives right of way for those who think with pure ignorance to voice a factually incorrect and exaggerated opinion. These are not the types of opinions that should be openly shared or taught on the internet and in any given situation that it could happen they need to restrict it. To reduce free speech may be an infringement but allow hateful speech is just wrong."
__label__Position	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__Position	The Palestinian Authority needs to be strengthened to combat extremism
__label__Evidence	time for a change
__label__Position	Moderators should review comment submissions and remove those that are inflammatory or hateful.
__label__Evidence	I think it is interesting to read the comments on a newspaper article, as the article is written from one perspective, while the comments show a much wider view. Even if I disagree with them, it is interesting and thought provoking to read the alternative view. Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__Position	Not really.. bad actors will find ways around any limitation.. AI might prevent direct hate speech, but then the various movements will use codes instead
__label__Evidence	removing comment sections takes away the chance to interact with others about a topic you care about
__label__Evidence	This doesn't stop the issue of trolls creating a new account and commenting again. The internet makes it too easy for people to spread negative ideas.
__label__Evidence	I think it would just become full of comments from people who were writing things just to get a reaction - feeding the trolls!
__label__Evidence	Censuring people will not solve the problem. People should be made accountable and educated
__label__Evidence	Cost of living is massive. Govt needs to get this under control 
__label__Position	Crime is on the rise and should be dealt with.
__label__Evidence	Helps prevent mental illnesses via online platforms.
__label__Position	We know from many studies that anonymity is a dangerous tool (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24373-001) that can cause people to agress in a way unusual to their regular behavior, what exacerbates this is when you see other people doing it also, it causes a sort of mob mentality (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannecroteau/2019/02/01/our-society-is-broken-lets-fix-it/). So removing hate speech by using a flag system in tandem with moderatos wouldn't just help those who may be affected by it but also dissuade cruel people from commenting something unkind.
__label__Evidence	i dont think being able to use hate speech, racist/homophobic language
__label__Evidence	Some views use coded racist language. Eg gypsies are often described using disguised phrases
__label__Position	comments should be moderated but we cannot remove all the negative and leave the positive comments. it would look like the newspaper is being biased
__label__Evidence	Censorship can go too far if the power is in the wrong hands. https://youtu.be/YyMGO2MO6GU
__label__Evidence	I would like to be able to see why this comment was removed.
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by regulating comments that are attacking a certain group with no true basis or facts
__label__Evidence	What about free speech?
__label__Evidence	would prevent hate
__label__Evidence	definetly an important issue too much of this country looks like a junkyard 
__label__Evidence	"This may be the route to take as websites would not loosely hide behind ""views expressed by the public on our websites do not represent our beliefs and values etc"" statements. They would implement stringent measures of selection."
__label__Evidence	This is increasingly the case, not only because they cost more to run, but also that, by not being on a clear improvement pathway, any potential purchaser or leaseholder will conclude their useful life is much shorter than it would otherwise be (i.e. for properties that are on a net zer pathway).
__label__Position	educate people on what hatesoeech s and the effects it has on people psycologically
__label__Evidence	involved
__label__Evidence	Completely agree with this point. Address the root cause of the problem might be difficult but hate speech should be avoided at all costs.
__label__Evidence	This would completely eliminate everyone elses' chance for discussion
__label__Evidence	It's pointless trying to stop people having opinions on the news. If no space to comment is provided people will simply go to other forums to express their views. These communities could be more insular and less moderated, leading to polarisation of views and ultimately breeding extremism.
__label__Evidence	This makes so much sense, and its not like it cannot be done. Many countries during the lockdown for Covid, showed they could easily have one day a month or such to have no pollution days where it would help the environment immensely
__label__Evidence	It would require more time and effort
__label__Position	Zadie Smith wrote an amazing article in The Guardian today. Siad something very true. We've missed being governed becuase the Tories right now are so selfish and factional.
__label__Position	I wish we had done now , knowing what we know but were protecting everyone the way we were told to do.
__label__Position	If it is digital newspaper the best idea would be to implement a auto detect tool that will detect and block harmful/hate speech.
__label__Evidence	allows you to read other people's opinions to help build your own
__label__Evidence	I agree that removing the comments section is not a solution to stopping hate speech as this just encourages users to go to different platforms, users need to be able to post their opinions but newspapers should have a responsibility to monitor what is being posted as well as a responsibility on the tone of articles they post online as this can have an effect on the type of comments that users leave as some users will see an article and the tone of the article will make them respond in a controversial way which encourages hate speech.
__label__Evidence	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided
__label__Evidence	how can you say this after the state the country is in
__label__Position	"NHS and how it will be ""fixed"". Pensions, University fees and tax"
__label__Evidence	Stops people with genuine none discriminatory opinions to express themselves
__label__Evidence	This is an interesting point of view and I certainly believe that reducing the level of anonymity may help to moderate opinions.
__label__Position	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__Position	when we talk about filtering the critical aspect that usually arise is the fact what would be the criteria who gonna decide what is hate speech and what is canceling people's right to speak
__label__Position	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__Position	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__Evidence	I agree, i think several moderators should be put in place to review the comments.
__label__Position	I think consistent and thorough moderation is the way forward with this. Any public forum requires a delicate balance of free speech and regulation though this seems to lean to the former at the moment - any Daily Mail article is evidence of this in particular. I do agree with a number of comments here, in that keeping commenting open allows for healthy discussion and learning opportunities, however, it is often the case that many comments left (particularly on sensitive or divisive topics) are irrelevant and are outright bullying.
__label__Position	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__Evidence	Saves having a human moderator soft through hundreds of comments.
__label__Evidence	I'm not sure if AI could function well enough at this time for this to be the final answer.
__label__Evidence	i agree with this completely
__label__Position	I have found research (Read here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323766/) that hateful comments can make people question the credibility or research etc. Whilst we definutely shouldn't agree with every research finding, and its good to question things, should the normal person who has little understanding of a topic be able to comment hate and reduce the integrity of news stories which are backed by years of education on the subject? Perhaps comment section can be more harm than good, especially if simply anyone can comment
__label__Position	Reducing the space reduces the opportunity for free speech and therefore the debate needs to be around whether or not free speech is allowed?  Personally, I feel that the newspapers need to carefully regulate what is being published and this includes the comments section.
__label__Evidence	Without a doubt these things need to be addressed
__label__Position	People can comment on other websites. They do not need to provide a comment platform on the same page. Or the newspaper can provide a forum.
__label__Position	NHS and Immigration
__label__Evidence	I don’t think completely removing the comment space would solve the issue. A similar example would be Youtube removing the dislikes count on videos, it makes t he information less objective.
__label__Position	Economy, health, climate change, housing, pretty much everything!
__label__Position	All this talk about educating one another or educating the perpetrators sounds like youre all in favour of mass reeducation China style
__label__Position	Hate speech is not a criticsm and should be avoided
__label__Evidence	Ethical opinions cannot be “measured”. There is certain subjectivity when taking about ethics
__label__Position	An issue is perhaps that different countries take different approaches to solving online problems. Some governments leave tech companies to solve these problems, while some governments take a more proactive role in eliminating hate speech, such as Japan. (https://reason.com/2022/07/09/new-japanese-law-makes-online-insults-a-jailable-offense/). However it is difficult because although the reduction of hate speech is something I am in favour of, I am also protective of privacy and as the article I linked notes, it is the governments in charge who define what hate speech is, which could potentially be a dangerous thing.
__label__Position	living crises and NHS waiting  list
__label__Evidence	"You'd have to get everyone to agree on a definition for cyber bullying before creating the software. Computers only know what you tell them, they aren't sentient beings capable of moral distinction. The human programming the software defines the meaning of hate speech, this really ties into the book ""Noise"" which discusses variables and the way it can drastically change outcomes based on the individual handling things. What is their life experience, have they experienced bullying, have they gotten therapy etc. If it's more than one person you have to collectively agree on shared experiences that culminate to the final definition  of bullying."
__label__Evidence	totally agree. I ran off a labour doorstepper earlier. A few years back I was the doorstepper. No room for people like me in the party anymore, makes me so sad
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is an essential right and should always be respected. However, I believe that those websites should obviously monitor comments for hate speech and other dangerous activities and remove those, as they most likely break their terms of services and also do not bring anything to whatever discussion may be going on. We can all disagree with each other without crossing a violent line, virtual or not.
__label__Evidence	To be fair I think all new governments want to do that. They just don't know how to do it!
__label__Position	The website must have words that are automatically marked as unacceptable. whenever those words are included in a comment, the website must privately warn the sender and not allow the comment to go through until the comment is rephrased correctly and politely.
__label__Evidence	unfortunately the net zero cult would be happy to have us living in mud huts if it meant less c02 even if every other country rightfully isnt doing it 
__label__Evidence	The problem is can an algorithm actually make the full determination of what is hateful and not? It may have the same biases.
__label__Position	We need to ensure fair prices and income for farmers
__label__Position	the state of the economy including issues such as taxation, spending and employment 
__label__Evidence	Why couldn't you directly comment on the newspaper? How is a different platform going to really help?
__label__Position	By educating people about the harm caused by hate speech that results in people committing suicide
__label__Position	Some of the ideas here are interesting.  Adding personal data before commenting to deter hate speech, for example, but in itself that seems open to abuse as well - although I guess data protection would apply to the information but would you always trust that this is applied? Also do we all want to be always personally associated with our comments, what if we do change or mind or temper our views? Sometimes being anonymous is important and helps you speak freely, isn't only abusive people who can benefit from being anonymous.  Using data to track people down to re-educate them feels like an abuse of power and a step too far.  And re-educate along what lines?  Using algorithms seems like a good idea but as we have seen with facebook, it doesn't always work very well.  However, it may be a blunt tool but it might be the best we have to work with given that it is a good point that the sheer volume of moderation that might be needed by people employed by the media to do so (either directly or via a third party, if you accept they have a responsibility to do this, which I do).  Ultimately, I liked best the idea of taking a median of views and making that the regulation that governs the practice.  The idea that this includes people and doesn't drive them into echo chambers.  I think it is important the nuance isn't lost.  Not everyone who sits in far right echo chambers, for example, ends up killing people in the mall. Hate rhetoric can be challenged if people can engage with each other.  I have seen this happen.  To answer the question, I would say that setting the rules clearly using various ways of presenting the information (as has been discussed) is really useful to engage people with the process, to check understanding.  Using flagging, software or/and by contributors also useful with penalties for consistent abuse.  Moderation by staff or third party to keep the human element with awareness and discussion of bias (encoded in software and also in us).  A clear step by step process that can end in a ban.  All of this is time consuming and expensive but necessary if you believe that people can change their minds, can be influenced positively by others, that free speech is important.
__label__Evidence	I've said that for a while, but what happens then? 
__label__Evidence	I feel like there isnt any party that give me confidence at all to vote for them 
__label__Position	Fake news and misinformation on social media are major concerns
__label__Position	"JUST SEEN THE LATEST POLLING. LOOKS LIKE SIR ED ""I LIKE FALLING OFF THINGS"" DAVEY IS GOING TO BE THE OPPOSITION. I HOPE THEY CAN SET UP A BUNGY OR PEDAL BIKE FOR HIM IN THE CHAMBER!"
__label__Position	Vegan way of eating and living is the only sustainable (for our planet) lifestyle 
__label__Evidence	I really like this idea, as hateful material could be hidden quickly.
__label__Evidence	People may feel as if they are being silenced.
__label__Position	anati
__label__Position	Maybe we should prioritise ergonomic chairs
__label__Evidence	I think that once you go down the route of cancelling comments, you run the risk of an almost dictatorship position for the newspapers, to be able to say what they like with no comeback from anyone.
__label__Position	Leaders, not just at the OU but in general, need to have the ability to communication with passion and clarity and to be able to inspire others to go on the journey with them. Management is about maintaining stability and BAU but leadership is more about inspiring and moving organisations forward, helping people to adapt and implement change where needed.
__label__Evidence	Excessive regulation could limit the benefits of social media and AI
__label__Position	"perhaps we need PR and making it legal to vote , this means having ""none of the above"" option.      It works in other countries.  I have met opel who do not bother to vote   "
__label__Position	Implementing consequences (such as bans, threats of police involvement etc) for users spewing hate speech in comment sections. Verifying user identities and only allowing verified users to comment, being able to trace an account back to a real person will make users more afraid of consequences and hopefully encourage them to be kind.
__label__Position	Sorting out inequality  
__label__Evidence	I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of 'tracking people down' for 're-education' for the sin of offering their opinions online (even if said opinions are quite obnoxious).
__label__Evidence	i think this would be a good thing and i totally agree - free speech without hate should be and is possible.
__label__Evidence	But what can be done about it? Will anything be done even with a report button
__label__Position	Weakening ethics and goodwill because of AI
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is important, people must be allowed to express their views about social issues that affect them, but it must not infringe on anyone's right either. The solution is to filter comments that contain hate speech
__label__Position	knowing who will keep to what they are saying
__label__Evidence	It is not possible for some people to ignore hate speech, and the effects can be extremely harmful - for example: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech
__label__Position	I have no real interest in reading readers comments sections in newspapers, but I don't agree that they should be eliminated. The content can be moderated to remove hate speech. This be done by a moderator, or these days, by AI.
__label__Evidence	Even with proactive communication, some stakeholders may still feel their concerns are not fully addressed
__label__Evidence	Brexit was a disaster!
__label__Position	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__Position	the cost of living
__label__Position	Policy level intervention may be necessary. It is supported by the research; see for example the paper published in Social Science Research: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X16303222?via%3Dihub
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	I agree and I think because there are so many people with so many different opinions, it should be censored before it is either posted or passed through the section.
__label__Evidence	Climate change is significantly impacting agricultural production
__label__Position	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__Evidence	Totally agree!
__label__Evidence	Personally I always used to vote Conservative but I will never ever forgive them for Brexit
__label__Position	I can be easily put in place with the system I already mentioned.
__label__Evidence	We don't have the resources to do this. It is completely unreasonable.
__label__Evidence	Not all opinions are valid. Some people should keep their hateful opinions to themselves. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	Funding of the NHS and the state of the economy
__label__Position	lack of funding for Nhs and police, cost of living crisis, support for palestine/sudan, employment.
__label__Evidence	Who gets to decide what constitutes a 'controversial topic'? This is still a form of censorship and should not be allowed.
__label__Evidence	I disagree but I still overall would do this
__label__Position	need all speech so we can change opinions of the bad people
__label__Evidence	That is not a bad idea that I think might work with proper moderation.
__label__Evidence	I don't believe that Scottish independence should be a central issue in this election. There are numerous other pressing matters that demand our attention and resources, such as healthcare, the economy, and climate change. These issues affect the entire population and have a more immediate impact on people's daily lives. Additionally, the question of Scottish independence primarily concerns a specific segment of the electorate, and focusing on it could divert attention from more urgent national concerns. It's essential that we prioritize addressing the broader challenges facing the country as a whole.
__label__Position	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them
__label__Evidence	I appreciate Twitter is not a news site and this is from the USA where the law is different but it could be a legal minefield:  https://news.northeastern.edu/2021/01/12/hate-thrives-on-social-media-but-who-should-police-it/
__label__Evidence	the benefits system needs to be looked at for sure
__label__Evidence	This may cost a company, but will also create jobs in our current stressful climate.
__label__Evidence	Genuine hate speech will be ignored with that view
__label__Evidence	I would disagree that the NHS needs more managers. That's part of the problem now. Too many managers.
__label__Position	To summarise my thinking, I maintain the view that certain offensive words/phrases should be automatically blocked, and that a manual reporting feature should be implemented to resolve other concerns.
__label__Evidence	Very clever Alison.
__label__Evidence	Indeed, because it is a tool made by human, it might have a creator bias 
__label__Position	for me the most important issue is getting tories out of power, it's turned the UK into a mess of a country
__label__Evidence	I think having the viewer agree to use respectful language before they are taken to the comment section could have some minor benefits.
__label__Position	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__Evidence	i agree repercussions should happen to the people who post hate comments
__label__Evidence	Don't think we should be censoring people
__label__Evidence	the rental market is insane and the lack of access to affordable secure housing is a major issue
__label__Position	we should worried=== Lack Of Transperancy
__label__Evidence	Free speech may be impacted
__label__Position	Yes, hate speech has become a pandemic and people are not aware of the damage it causes, removing or blocking such comments is not a solution and the perpetrator will use another platform. Rather let's educate one another and develop informative educational policy to eliminate the source rather than the symptoms. Education will liberate the mind and promote uniy and selfless.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section does violate free speech as not all comments contain hate speech and testing different measures of dealing with the comment section can be explored to see what works but removing the comment section altogether is a no.
__label__Evidence	it would be nice if the comment could be made visible after it has been removed. others can know what to avoid and if it is NOT actually hate speech the conversation could be continued don't you think?
__label__Evidence	Yes, completely agree and efficiency in police work to allow meaningful work - yes paperwork and accountability needs to be done but why not restructure with more admin staff? also mental health service to free the police to concentrate on crime. It is really stretched and under resourced with limited power it seems!
__label__Position	Overall, it seems that a public forum to share thoughts is important, but that free speech does not give the right to hate speech. Education of young people is important as a preventative, but doesn't help now, so monitoring to ensure that comments are respectful and appropriate is necessary. This could be done by humans or an algorithm, but I think a combination of both is important, to cover human error and ensure machines are working effectively.
__label__Position	Immigration and Public services
__label__Position	I think the best solution is a self-policing reporting system. Allowing the users themselves to have a say in what is problematic would save a lot of time otherwise needed to moderate the platform.
__label__Position	by tighter regulation of newspapers and make them responsible for their content, make them vet and verify all contributed content
__label__Evidence	Moderators could be biased on subjective in their opinions.
__label__Position	Another interesting argument is that there is a risk with platforms that alllow annonynimity online.  For example as quoted here: https://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs6461/www/Reading/Davenport02.pdf and it can allow hate speech to go unmoderated.
__label__Evidence	Completely correct, effective moderation is the answer.
__label__Position	More support for small businesses, start ups etc. From what I've seen it really isn't that good in terms of practical help, advice and support, seems to be run by councils ticking boxes and under qualified advisers speaking about the obvious 
__label__Position	tax, Health
__label__Position	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__Position	Yes we need to make it more tempting to take up NHS positions instead of losing people to private firms or overseas
__label__Evidence	There are a lot of moral issues to consider when talking about things like population control. Issues like these have been in public policy for decades without a solution.
__label__Position	Hate speech is hidden love that is just imperfectly expressed and should be protected 
__label__Evidence	les modérateurs ont un rôle important à jouer mais, en fonction du flux de commentaires, il peut-être difficile à mettre en œuvre.
__label__Evidence	comments on every platform can become a breeding ground for hate. It becomes a place for people to vent and voice their hateful comments, it can also lead to bullying and other negative aspects of online life. Comments should be banned unless heavily moderated.
__label__Evidence	I agree somewhat.
__label__Evidence	Would this not limit freedom of speech then ? people wont truly speak their minds if its being filtered first. Moderators would be given too much power ?
__label__Position	Implement training and literacy programs on democracy
__label__Evidence	no use to rejoin the EU, we would be the ugly cousin. stay a sovreign self governed nation
__label__Position	major cost of living
__label__Evidence	It would be irresponsible for newspaper publications to not police comments as they are giving the platform for people to voice their opinions. Them turning a blind eye to hate speech could be mistaken as them endorsing or condoning those utterances. The following article serves to support my stance and should you wish maybe you can take a second to read though it. https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Position	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is some fairly clear definitions, particularly around race and gender [https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech], so it really shouldn't be hard to identify clearly offensive comments directed at a person or group of persons, over valid criticism. The only danger is if the moderator is also biased and does not like an opinion, but in these cases, an independent review will clearly show an abuse of moderator power.
__label__Evidence	Some opinions may be trigger ing to others
__label__Evidence	Agree. it also highlights the need for work to be done on hate speech/racism. Just because the comments section isn't there, doesn't mean hate speech  doesn't exist.
__label__Evidence	Saw a depressing documentary about the NHS and heard doctors say there are not enough medicines.  This is because there are too many people now on our small island, so I link it all to education problems and immigration, I fear.
__label__Evidence	I agree that if governments are not willing to inform the public and stop manipulating us by placing chemical in the air for solar engineering than how do they expect individuals to comply
__label__Position	The newspaper could automate hate speech content deletion. For example certain shares could be automatically deleted/removed.
__label__Evidence	Totally agree price s are going up all the time  
__label__Evidence	Free speech is very important, but newspapers also has a responsibilty to ensure hate speech is not spread through their comment section.
__label__Evidence	the Uk hardly contributes to glabal warming yet were are doing alot compared to others - we need to hold the biggest poluting countries accountable imho
__label__Position	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__Evidence	Not exaclty, you can't talk in a way that hurts other people
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	we have alternate way to think this problem. human population control is may be possible one way. but other way we have to follow and find alternate solution for this climate change problems like find reusable energy sources and green sources. mainly control co2 pollution through vehicles.
__label__Evidence	Bottom-up approaches have more legitimacy with citizens
__label__Position	I maintain that rules and measures should be put in place to regulate users and resulting consequences too in order to keep newspaper comments section free of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	hate speech can be aggressive
__label__Evidence	I have to disagree with this, as giving an opinion that is opposite to the other person's opinion is completely different that using hate speech to deliver the message. You can have free speech and hate speech banning at the same time working together. Using AI to spot hatespeech keywords, while still allowing people to argue and have different opinions, as long as they aren't doing it the wrong way.
__label__Evidence	As I said we need a new finacial system. We are being distracted from the real source of the problem. Logically whoever control of the finances has all the power. What happens tomorrow wont make a difference to that fact. 
__label__Evidence	Having a moderator and strict rules in place to ban or suspend accounts that express a form of hate speech is needed. Actually replying to that comment as the newspaper will show everyone else that it really is not okay
__label__Evidence	It could help address declining civic participation
__label__Position	Conservation of resources may end up where it's eventually undone by someone who takes them, as nature doesnt like a void.So climate change can be neutral at best and getting worse at worst with this principle.
__label__Evidence	"I think people who focus on supposed benefit scroungers are quite easily led, tbh. You're focusing on people at the bottom rather than at the top, and if you really think those at the top all ""earned it through hard work"" you've been had!"
__label__Position	Immigration is also a huge factor for the country.  Our country cannot support more people just coming into the country.
__label__Evidence	Yep. Rather implement ways in which one can refrain from hate speech
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution 
__label__Position	to appoint a panel from different backgrounds to review comments
__label__Evidence	free speech doesn't give you the right to harass other peop le
__label__Position	In South Africa , After the ANC was elected to rule, There was a truth and reconciliation that was held by members of the public and officials of the new government. They where persecuting's human rights offenders and those who where charged with Apartheid crimes. So a lot of core things where said , that's where you could see that hate speech is hate speech to the person receiving I most cases , but to the person saying/commenting it is just an opinion of what they think of per say subject
__label__Evidence	Stops online bullying
__label__Position	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__Evidence	I feel this could lead to propagating false information through inclusion of poorly researched urls.
__label__Position	I believe if we can be on the same page and let the media tell the story the truth with out lashing out on it.
__label__Evidence	I don't really think that any of the posts above really do touch the matter of this one so I can't really think of anything else to my argument here. (Evaluation as asked)
__label__Evidence	freedom of speech needs to be maintained whilst making sure other people's rights are not violated and people do not have to read 'hate speech' which is offensive to them personally,
__label__Evidence	A bot could not fully remove hate speech and could even possibly remove valid points and arguments thinking it was hate speech.
__label__Position	no removing the platform is not the solution to limit hate speech rather it would be suitable to have some sort of filtration or observance of the verbal allowance
__label__Position	Not allowing of comments attributed to hate speech to be posted will eliminate hate speech altogether. This can be done by a computer bot as it would be humanly difficult to monitor flooding comments.
__label__Evidence	But what if the opinion of others infringes upon the rights of another. As much as we should all be able to express our opinion it shouldn't be at the expense of others.
__label__Evidence	Population experts expect that the world's population will plateau in several decades without any coercion. Educating people about effective means of birth control and social responsibility could have some effect of speeding the leveling of the population sooner. There doesn't seem to be the need for drastic measures.
__label__Evidence	I agree! I think restricting comment sections won't stop harmful opinions, they will just be posted elsewhere. But creating a safer environment for these discussions would be good
__label__Position	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__Evidence	I agree - ban certain words
__label__Position	I do not believe that removing the comment section of newspapers really helps too much in preventing hate speech as most hate speech is spread in general social media more than in comment sections. However  I do not believe that newspapers have any obligation to even have comment sections. Newspapers were traditionally something that you read and discussed in other locations with people. The newspapers of the past had no obligation to print people's letters etc. If newspapers have comment sections they should be moderated to avoid hate speech
__label__Evidence	it says it could be removed, but doesn't guarantee always
__label__Evidence	time consuming
__label__Position	I agree it is going to need a world effort to control the climate change and also we need to use classic technologies like cycle and public transports . If we don't do it we are suffers lot. surly human cause the global warming the large countries and humans need aware of it. bio gas and low carbon released vehicles most electric and solar vehicles are best.
__label__Evidence	If they give source to backup their views. That is good as you can verify it though the site could be bias.
__label__Position	But newspapers and media outlets have guidelines and evidence-based (usually) rules to stick to; the general public in a comments section don't have any such instruction and thus their opinion will be weighted differently, without evidence.
__label__Position	The concept of freedom is not to being safe, is the liberty to asume the risks of that freedom. Limiting what newspapers can publish goes contrary to freedom of press. 
__label__Evidence	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Evidence	On the other hand if platforms are held accountable, they may prefer to remove all comments sections, so as not to be punished  themselves.
__label__Position	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are! 
__label__Position	Weapons automatization 
__label__Position	Get a group to fairly decide on words that should be banned
__label__Position	The comments that people make could be reviewed by a machine that learns the difference between an opinion and hate speech which can determine what comments can be on newspaper sites
__label__Position	2. We can not dictate how media houses run their operations
__label__Evidence	A website having the ability to gain enough personal information on you is dangerous. This is  dangerous for anybody whether their comment was hate speech or not. Hackers and third parties can gain access to that information.
__label__Evidence	How are we in jeopardy? The earth has made it this long, it will continue that way.
__label__Position	Like I mentioned previously,the need for artificial intelligence is vital and like what AliceW mentioned in hjer post that people needs to be educated about hate speech which I strongly support.I also think it is everyone's responsibility to educate each other the damage hate speech has to individuals and the society at large
__label__Position	Climate change
__label__Position	All comments would need to be vetted before being posted on the site.
__label__Position	Generally, most users agree that removing the comment spaces will likely affect free speech. I have agreed with this reasoning in my previous comment. There are some users who believe that the hate speech problem can also be solved through systems like algorithms and monitoring devices that identify hate speech. I think this is a great idea. Not only does it retain free speech in this regard, but it wll possibly deter future hate speech comments.
__label__Evidence	But humans are humans and some abuse these priveleges  by posting what they like without considering the consequences.
__label__Evidence	Free speech can be restricted.
__label__Evidence	I agree that with the current level of technology there is no problem as to monitoring comment sections for offensive language. This can be easily removed.
__label__Position	If newspapers want to keep their comment section, they should perform some kind of moderation of the comments.
__label__Position	Why are we giving so much money to immigrants
__label__Evidence	these are important issues to me
__label__Evidence	This could work
__label__Evidence	L'avantage réside dans la baisse de pollution des grands centres urbains. Mais le réchauffement global ne baissera pas comme cela
__label__Evidence	How dow we establish what harm is?
__label__Evidence	I think people take comments sections with a pinch of salt - they aren't creating fake news, they're often just expressing opinions, providing context or simply having fun.
__label__Position	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__Position	I have not decided yet and will vote with a tactic behind it
__label__Evidence	AI unfortunately does inherit the biases of it's creators and is by no means a perfect solution.
__label__Position	the track record of different political parties will also pay a big role on how i decide on who to vote
__label__Position	I agree: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Evidence	Simpler communication could increase citizen engagement
__label__Evidence	The EU is already quite good at foresight, but implementation is challenging
__label__Evidence	If the accurate information is given.
__label__Evidence	If you only hear things you agree with how can you grow and develop as well as develop your position so that it is defensible when its challenged
__label__Evidence	I am just answering as much as I can and hoping for the best
__label__Evidence	Strongly agree, people who are expressing their fear of censorship should consider the risks that hate speech create for groups of people. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	I don’t believe that it would be enough to reduce the impact but the visibility only, potentially paving the way for further discussions hence increasing the risk of danger. 
__label__Position	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8585974/
__label__Evidence	I think we should move internal toilets and bathrooms back outside as these are the greatest historic change in the moisture physics of buildings. Should we do this or embrace out inside toilets as a needed risk to the fabric of buildings to meet todays needs, just as we need to embrace IWI to meet future needs (Richard Lorch)
__label__Evidence	I agree, there are currently no online hate speech statistics available due to a lack of means to report hate speech: https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/
__label__Position	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!
__label__Position	Include a chapter on dissenting opinions in EU decision-making
__label__Evidence	This is bad for the environment and also limits some people from reading news, even if free.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	Perhaps but a well defined policy by the newspaper should be able to indicate what is and is not allowed
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites. One way is to create a system where readers can flag articles that contain hate speech. Another way is to have a team of moderators who review articles before they are published.
__label__Evidence	All of those yes, but has Labour got those covered I don't think any of them know what they are doing now 
__label__Evidence	agreed, the NHS is severely under funded 
__label__Evidence	You can't censor everybody because of the behaviour of the few. Better to deal with the keyboard warriors individually
__label__Evidence	Europe has an opportunity to develop technologies specifically for deliberative democracy
__label__Evidence	I don't agree with removing the space for views to be aired. That is an important part of challenging and changing opinion. I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated so finding the users and punishing them is key.
__label__Position	Newspapers need to consider carefully how the comments affect readers' perception of an article - it may be preferable for the newspaper to remove the comment section unless they monitor the comments carefully: https://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/comments_color_news_perception.php
__label__Position	Unesco suggest 5 ways to counter hate speech in the media, (https://en.unesco.org/5-ways-to-counter-hate-speech) within this they suggest the regulation / moderation of comments and socal media as well as ending the impunity for hate speech online.
__label__Position	Comments, especially on a heated/controversial topic, can quickly disintegrate into banter and spiral into hateful and hurtful comments. Therefore, it is important to reduce this occurrence with moderators that warn and remove those that cross the line. However, moderators can be biased as well. It is therefore important to first allow multiple moderators from different sides and create a definition of what is considered hate speech so that removal can be justified.
__label__Position	Hope the lock down because of corona must have proved that the environment is less polluted when people stop coming out of their home. But it is not possible to stay at home completely. But it is a evidence that human is polluting the economy. so they can reduce the pollution by way of using electric vehicles, cycling and other ways
__label__Position	Brexit, which has destroyed this country and it's reputation.  Taxes, which have been covertly raised to the highest level on generations.. I will vote for the candidate most likely to oust the conservatives.
__label__Position	People who are signed up to online newspaper websites need to be warned that hate speech or continual hate speech comments can result in them being banned permanently from the news websites. People from the newspaper websites need to hire someone, if they haven't, to monitor and control which comments should be eliminated.
__label__Position	once news is exposed to the internet, everyone has access to it, and right to comment any how they feel about the news, but hate speech is very unacceptable, if you find the news very uncomfortable, just skip the site and find news that suits your needs.
__label__Evidence	I agree with Richard in so far as newspapers to this point mostly haven't had very successful moderating systems. Either they are unaware of current methods of spreading misinformation or they bring down the ban hammer so quickly that it makes their comments confusing
__label__Position	Hate Speech must be properly defined and published in the form of a rule/guideline before comment moderation can occur.
__label__Evidence	This goes beyond just technical issues, it is also a matter of civilization for the general public to show it cares about fellow citizens with disabilities. 
__label__Position	Let immigrants work once they are here
__label__Position	Another way to reduce hate speech in comment sections without having to have someone manually checking each comment is to have AI or an algorithm use filters to filter out comments that have certain trigger words in them and remove them as soon as they are posted. This is not a fool proof method but it would certainly stop a lot of hate speech filtering in and it would negate having someone sit and monitor the comment section of each newspaper. Source: https://www.medienanstalt-nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/materials_and_ordering_system/download/L202_Hateful-Commenting-Online.pdf
__label__Position	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__Evidence	Algorithums
__label__Evidence	This would be a great idea, however, it's also important to take into notice that everyone has their own biased; so one statement could be hate speech to one but not the other
__label__Position	everyone should talk about themselves not other people because they will feel offended
__label__Evidence	would move the issue somewhere else
__label__Position	it is the newspapers responsibility to filter out hate speech and flag the users doing so, removing the comment section does infringe the right to free-speech.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is dangerous because words have power and can influence others to act. It is the denial of acts of tolerance, inclusion, diversity and the very essence of human rights norms and principles. Addressing and countering hate speech is, therefore, a necessity
__label__Position	The state of the NHS, the lack of trust in the current government, the economy
__label__Evidence	save a lot of hate speech being publicized.
__label__Evidence	How can the classing system be done, through examples?
__label__Position	Ethics in Politics
__label__Position	By having comments moderated so hate speech is screened out
__label__Evidence	Who gets to decide what qualifies as hate speech?  If I criticize someone from a protected class for their own bad behavior, what's to stop them from shielding themselves from that criticism by claming it to be hate speech?
__label__Position	There is simply no place for hate speech in today's society. Even if you are not the intended victim, there are ways you can take a stand against it. The following article provides some helpful tips: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	#Partygate 
__label__Evidence	Population experts expect that the world's population will plateau in several decades without any coercion. Educating people about effective means of birth control and social responsibility could have some effect of speeding the leveling of the population sooner. There doesn't seem to be the need for drastic measures. 
__label__Evidence	Definitely, which party do you think would be best for the task? 
__label__Evidence	This would reduce comments that may be derogatory and or offensive and in some cases discriminatory.
__label__Position	Allowing other members to flag comments for you could be very helpful as it cuts down on having moderators soft through everything.  Good people usually are very helpful in flagging up hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Very well put, totally agree
__label__Evidence	Yes it was disgusting, surely no one can trust them after that!
__label__Position	free speech
__label__Position	I think that it's right that some controversial newspapers limit comments because members of the public are not informed enough to comment or commenting gives them a platform to spread misinforamtion e.g., on climate change. Algorithms should therefore be used to preserve comments but filter out negativity, misinformation and abuse.
__label__Evidence	Not anymore, soon to be PM Starmer (Mandelson) doesn't want it and won't discuss
__label__Evidence	How did you reach that conclusion? Regulation of comment sections has proven to be effective, as long as people are willing to help the platform by reporting these hate speeches so that it is properly dealt with.
__label__Position	Pages could have a filter system that blocks certain words
__label__Evidence	"""More informed, well-advised people can make more courageous decisions"" (Crispin Edwards)"
__label__Evidence	I agree that this would help to improve young people's access to housing.  Might also help improve economic growth.
__label__Position	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation.
__label__Position	I believe that reducing hate speech is a fair choice and it is not taking away freedom pf speech . Hate speech is abusive, threatening and expresses prejudice against a particular group , religion or race, we do not encourage that as a society and it is something that is not allowed in this society.
__label__Evidence	Removing the platform is a preferable one
__label__Position	We should create a paltform for anyone to express their opinions and others able to respond to their view. With freedom of speech, the ideas will be filtered out.
__label__Position	Removal of comments entirely is akin to removal of freedom of speech and should be avoided.
__label__Evidence	Having real people that moderate comments on a newspaper website where there are thousands of comments is unrealistic. At best you could have an algorithm that auto bans comments that contain key words and/or phrases and then have those reviewed by a real person.
__label__Evidence	Scotland already has a proportionate voice
__label__Position	The current party in power have used Trans people as a weapon to start culture wars in UK politics. The people of this country care more about the cost of living and the NHS, than trans people who are already a marginalised community.
__label__Evidence	This article suggests that more hateful comments are posted when the article/content is about real world divisive events
__label__Position	I have followed the election coverage a little but am not very involved. I will not be voting.
__label__Position	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Evidence	How will we stop/prevent people from being aggressive with their opinion though particularly if they find a news story disagreeable?
__label__Evidence	i agree.  Why has this not been mentioned by any party. 
__label__Evidence	They'd be less incentivised to start any speech. Who would agree to giving copious amounts of personal data to some faceless online entity just to make a comment?
__label__Evidence	It's up to the reader to consider what is true and what is untrue. I think newspapers could do more to provide guidance on how to evaluate the reliability of sources.
__label__Evidence	there definitely is
__label__Position	lts true hate speech should be taken as positive criticism
__label__Evidence	Regardless of training, unconscious and conscious biases will be introduced regardless as the moderators are human.
__label__Position	I think there is room for AI to filter comments that refer to any sort of hate
__label__Position	It shouldn't be solely a newspaper issues. All aspects of society need to tackle the issue. Check out this article below. There seems to have been a focus on criminal punishment with new legislation allowing an increase in sentencing for hate crimes. Still a long way to go but these are positive stats: https://www.cps.gov.uk/crime-info/hate-crime
__label__Position	We need a minimal set of protection measures (masks, ventilation...) in public spaces and public transportation.
__label__Evidence	I think this should be done by a real person, as using a computer, some hateful words can be disguised and still get through
__label__Position	Readers that feel the need to put hate speech in comment section only do so because of the way they can remain anonymous online. In everyday life you could go months and if not years without hearing hate speech, whilst it can almost be a daily occurrence when browsing online in various forums, social media platforms or comment sections on news websites. Finding a way for readers/users not to remain anonymous and having real consequences for spreading hate speech would reduce this issue.
__label__Evidence	rishi thinks he can cut all taxes and still put in billions into nhs and other public services which is not realistic sadly
__label__Evidence	This might overcome some problems, but would be hard to remove subtle or 'disguised' hate speech, if only working on word triggers.
__label__Evidence	solving the cost of living and housing should form a strong basis for election choices, sunak has failed to do so, Keir Starmer seems to have quite a good plan

__label__Evidence	Disinformation is rampant: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html
__label__Position	Freedom of speech still has its limits!!
__label__Position	It is really hard for people to make sense of how to move from carbon targets to energy targets. People need simple advice that they can use to comfortably adapt while conserving heritage.
__label__Evidence	I overall agree with this- communication is the key.
__label__Position	Based on the analytics, most people disagree with suggestions put forward so it is difficult to decide on a way to reduce hate speech whilst comment sections still exist. Most people agree that moderation is a good approach, it's just difficult to know if all people doing this will be fair. It might be better to do it with AI so it's non biased.
__label__Position	By making people aware that hate speech is not good by creating awareness campaigns against hate specch.
__label__Evidence	One of the problems with social media is the use of bots which dramatically wreak havoc with algorithms. It creates a technical imbalance and an environment that is less reality based and more echo chamber. Cleaning this up would be a huge start.
__label__Evidence	most politician's have never had to struggle therefore they do not understand how many are simply scrapping by in the current climate
__label__Position	Policy makers have vested interests with industry to ignore signals of overshoot and straining risks. Whatever action will be taken too late and there is no way to prevent feedback loops
__label__Evidence	we have a duty to protect people, not ship them off like their lives mean nothing or have them risk their lives entering illeagally 
__label__Position	I want to see public sector pay increases, especially the NHS. Housing sorted, pensions secured and generally lower taxes on the general public and higher on the super rich
__label__Position	I think we need to think about the purpose of debate and how successful it really is in changing peoples minds. are people who engage in hate speech really open to discussion and changing their mind?
__label__Position	Improve information provision and transparency
__label__Position	Devolving more powers to Metro Mayors (I'm in favour)
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is removed
__label__Position	No, because the newspapers should only provide information and journalism, the hate speech should be condemned by the public, not censored by the newspaper 
__label__Position	We need an action programme to develop a more inclusive sector
__label__Evidence	Whilst I think that removing comments wouldn't fix hate speech, surely it would definitely diminish it and isn't that better than no solution at all?
__label__Position	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__Position	Actions of current government in office
__label__Evidence	I agree, the fact that newspaper are not able to provide a fair and safe discussion space it is not a reason to reduce free speech
__label__Evidence	You didn't discuss why they should not include a comments section. A comment sections allows the public to share their opinions on the subject matter and engage with one another pros and cons of the issue and see other points of view.
__label__Evidence	I agree the comment section is for everyone- but what else can we do. Evidence has shown that hate speech can lead to real life crimes, and that needs to be tackled.
__label__Evidence	testing with slide, somewhat agree
__label__Evidence	Monitoring and moderating is not enough. It wont solve the problem.  Look at this study: https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__Evidence	Homelessness became visibly more prevalent in London after the Tories got in. It's reminiscent of how it was in the 80s/90s. For all my disagreements with New Labour, I saw nowhere near the number of rough sleepers then as I do now.
__label__Evidence	I agree. So many crimes/acts of violence in the real world have begun as online comments. It is certainly an important topic to discuss and find the right solutio n for.
__label__Evidence	I would agree that a moderator system would be a better choice than removing the comments.
__label__Position	Cost of Living crisis and poverty, policing, NHS, education, investment, policing
__label__Position	The key issues for me are the conflict in the Middle East and increase in discrimination in the UK
__label__Position	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__Evidence	Bang on being listed and heritage is no excuse to cutting carbon (Chit Chong)
__label__Evidence	Agree, the biggest contributors of CO2 emissions (USA and China) should do the most effort to reverse this
__label__Position	newspaper should allow only be printing/posting the facts and the comments sections should be free of any opinion even hate. but the community of users should be able to upvote/downvote their posts.
__label__Position	No one is discussing that fact that our universities are broke, and in some cases, some are about to go bankrupt. 
__label__Position	removing the Conservatives/change
__label__Position	There should be fines introduced for hateful speech.
__label__Evidence	This would be really hard to put into practice. I believe people should have the freedom to remain anonymous as long as they are respecful of others.
__label__Position	The first position is that readers comments must be filtered to remove any comments that contain hate speech.  The second position is that filtering comments is in itself an infringement of freedom of speech, and that people should be free to express themselves the way they want to. The bottom line is that readers get a chance to express their opinions in the comments section and tackle social issues but it should not be done in a way that will hurt other people in any way. The comments section encourages healthy engagement and debate.
__label__Evidence	'too woke'  in what way exactly?
__label__Position	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__Position	"""We shouldn't be obessed by the numbers. Learning from the more difficult projects can feed into mainstream, unlocks potential value in the 20 of the 80/20"" (Paul Norman)"
__label__Position	I think that removing the comment space isn't the right solution. Change the website alrorithms to prevent and censore hate words would be the addequate thing to do.
__label__Position	i have very little money as a pensioner but the cost of living is escalating so I don1t feel that the tories have protected my asets. even on my low inccome I would rather pay a little more tax in order tohave public services that work
__label__Evidence	However, there are often ways to get around automatic moderation, and manually completed moderation would use a large amount of man hours and money
__label__Evidence	yes it's true several articles show the effects that harassment on social networks can have on mental health
__label__Position	Create a data union and personalized information wallet for citizens
__label__Evidence	I don't agree, it just needs to be monitored whether by ai or human
__label__Evidence	Most expensive rail travel in Europe but it's awful so I agree!
__label__Evidence	Moderation is a good idea
__label__Evidence	I think that is an excellent idea, perhaps using some form of AI could be used to cut down costs.
__label__Position	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__Evidence	There are more pressing issues currently 
__label__Position	Building £1.5 million new houses, some of them on green belt
__label__Position	everything has worsened inthe last 14 years
__label__Position	Taxing the richest will make them move to Italy or Spain for £100,000 to be tax free. These are some of our biggest employers.NOOO THANKSA
__label__Position	I still maintain, comment sections should stay. Hate speech CAN and should be filtered. Read up more on this topic: https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__Evidence	I agree with you, online privacy is already a massive issue, I don't want to have to submit even more personal data (that could end up sold to advertisers) just to comment on an article. I also don't think 'tracking down' people who post hate speech online is practical or achievable.
__label__Position	I suggest that there should be some kind of concern form on the website to bind users from not using foul language or hate speech. This will help people state factual arguments or getting their opinions without hate speech. However, people must have freedom of speech and opinion to what they read.
__label__Position	have filters on the comments to block certain words and phrases
__label__Evidence	I agree with this as it is important to allow freedom of speech, however, not to the detriment of others.  There need to be acceptable guidelines.
__label__Evidence	yes indeed we have to check the root cause analysis
__label__Evidence	if comments spaces are removed it also lessens freedom of speech
__label__Position	We need to stand together as readers against hate speech.freedom of speech is allowed to give your thoughts and opinion about a certain topic but that doesn't give a person full right for a person to be disrespectful.freedom of speech should build and not to destroy a person.
__label__Evidence	Compelling argument
__label__Position	Social Housing is another important issue 
__label__Position	I think ways we can reduced hate speech include education on media ethics, as well as we should encourage conflict sensitive reporting and multicultural awareness campaigns. Also regulate the comments. This UNESCO article expands on these ideas: https://en.unesco.org/5-ways-to-counter-hate-speech
__label__Position	I stand by my position of a moderator system
__label__Position	allow people to say what they feel
__label__Evidence	We alreay pay taxes.... and don't get the good infrastructure... so it's not about money. they can raise the taxes wherever they want the issue wont resolve, as they dont want to resolve it.
__label__Evidence	I agree with you, i feel like thats what media is about, expressing ourselves.
__label__Evidence	reduces free speech
__label__Evidence	Farage has proven he has no interest in actually fixing things. He had the second to last attendance rate of any MEP in Brussels (the overall least attending never showed up). And he spent years droning on about the destruction of the fishing industry, then finally gets put on a committee about fishing and never turned up. He's a charlatan only out for his own ego, not hard work. 
__label__Evidence	Commenting on online platforms with hate speech is a lazy, cowardly way of spreading negativity. If those who partake in this sort of online behaviour lacked the platform to do this, I don't think they would act out in other ways. I think they spread hate online as it's a very easy way to do so and takes no energy and is anonymous.
__label__Position	due to the changing world and the improvement of technology,the internet is like a black canvas and anyone can put anything they want on it,but even though technology is improving most websites dont use basic protection,they could do things like add comment filters,then this ensures that hateful words or phrases cannot be used but positive and informative words and statements can be
__label__Evidence	The right to free speech doesn't mean there should be no consequences for hate speech.
__label__Position	I think nowadays most people keep up to date with the day's news via social media sites such as Instagram, Twitter or Facebook.   So removing comment section from news sites will not stop the hate speech as this could be done freely on any of the other platforms.  You are never going to get away from hate speech completely but I do think limiting same by using AI could help in reducing same.
__label__Position	"In the EU we have a Code of Conduct, to prevent and counter the spread of illegal hate speech online, in2016, the Commission agreed with several social media platforms a code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online. I think the companies should be the ones responsible for removing the hate speech on their platforms and should have consequences if they do not. This has been proven to improve the removal of hate speech. According to https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en ""the last evaluation shows that on average the companies are now assessing 81% of flagged content within 24 hours and 62.5% of the content deemed illegal hate speech is removed."""
__label__Position	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__Position	Healthcare and the operation of the NHS is one of my key issues. Substantial sums of money are being introduced into what seems to be a bottomless pit. and no improvement is seen in treatment waiting times, there is a shortfall in the  numbers of doctors/dentists and the managemnt of all areas of the NHS is unsatisfactory.
__label__Evidence	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites. A newspaper must responsibly manage its public platform, and giving platform to hate speech is a problem it can manage. A newspaper is, by definition, not a forum.
__label__Evidence	The two-state solution remains the official policy of the EU and most of the international community
__label__Position	removing the comment space from newspapers is not a way, there should be a parallel monitor that filters comments as well as bots that flag comments
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech comes with a responsibilty, and if people are not responsible with their rights, there should be measures put into place to fix that
__label__Evidence	hate speech is possible
__label__Position	Censorship of hateful words, phrases and names should be blocked to supplement moderation.
__label__Position	There should be moderation reviewers to delete harmful comments
__label__Position	A mass ban on certain words should be the first step and the be moderated by the users through a report system. This will eliminate the need for a dedicated moderator and instead be self governed. The final action can be decided by the newspaper which, for the most part should be a quick procedure.
__label__Position	its hard to concentrate on other important issues with finances so tight and bills and food unaffordable
__label__Evidence	I don't think everything should dumbed down, I think people should try to learn what is happening 
__label__Position	The is no need to moderate comments they must be dished out raw as they are writen by the readers
__label__Position	this is not possible, you either allow free speech or you don't
__label__Evidence	"In a neoliberal capitalist society,  is hard to find incentives for ""everyone working together"" and ""making sacrifices"""
__label__Evidence	If everyone is honest about what they saw.
__label__Position	I do agree that hate speech is indeed a big problem in this technological era. However,removing the ability for one to express themselves takes away the freedom of speech too. Maybe a good solution could be having the algorithm/AI filter those comments and not display them at all before they get to the public eye. People entering the platform can be informed of the rules against hate speech and be given a disclaimer that access to the page will be denied if any hate speech is dictated or an miscellaneous comments.
__label__Evidence	Whoever creates the algorithm then ultimately decides what is hate speech. There need to be a common neutral definition of what hate speech is before any kind of censorship algorithm can be developed.
__label__Evidence	IT's all about the VC 
__label__Evidence	Such algorithms can be completely customized. For example: any posts containing a list of any key words can be prevented from posting.
__label__Evidence	If we raise our children with the same values like our generation did, then we are just fuelling the same viscous circle that destroys our planet
__label__Evidence	Cost of living really needs addressing, it cant continue like this
__label__Position	you can't if there is a comments box then those comments are individuals opinions and unless they are removed they stay for all to read
__label__Position	What if the website somehow blocks words which are hateful or discriminatory from their comment section
__label__Evidence	Yes, I agree to some extent, but I don't think you'll ever find a party that completely mirrors your values, it's important to pick a party leader you feel has integrity and principles even if you don' t necessarily agree with everything they want to achieve
__label__Evidence	agreed, it is an important issue 
__label__Evidence	Whilst this isn't a terrible idea for this issue if everyone in comments sections is discoverable this could be very dangerous and turn what is a purely online hate problem into a real hate problem. Many people online have talked about issues with stalkers and being doxxed and this could make the problem a lot worse.
__label__Position	Would require you to identify the hate speech so that people can learn that it is unacceptable and harmful to the readers of such comments. The keyboard warriors tend to abuse the freedom of speech. removing the the comment section would not be a good idea as we tend to be intriguid by the kind of feedback certain posts receive.
__label__Position	What issues are the priority?
__label__Position	I support the decision of newspapers to remove the comments section. They should have letters pages like theiur hard copy versions where a letters editor decides what should be published.
__label__Evidence	Very appropriate. Hopefully people will interpret this that if they were thinking of posting something bad then keep quiet and don't!
__label__Evidence	Good idea but an education policy would take time to be effective
__label__Evidence	You're voting for your local MP.
__label__Evidence	Yes it does - but without the label 'racist' when talked about
__label__Evidence	It can empower consumers to make sustainable choices
__label__Evidence	I think this is definitely important and will help but we need so much more than this. To me this is just one of the many important steps and changes we must make. All of these things and all of us working together can make a significant change.
__label__Evidence	Moderators also have bias
__label__Evidence	I agree that there should be technologies that are able to scan and the comment section to detect and flag any offensive/derogatory words in the comments before the comments are published.
__label__Position	I think AI is going to become a big problem over the next year and this needs to be closely monitred and safe huarded
__label__Position	Never use hate speech at all is not good for somebidy's heath
__label__Position	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__Evidence	I agree that there is no need for comment sections under newspaper articles when most of the comments end up being a form of hate speech. A separate platform to discuss these articles would be better as it could be more easily monitored.
__label__Evidence	This may lead to insensitivity to other readers
__label__Evidence	"Please outline the nature of the immigration ""crisis"" "
__label__Evidence	I have yet to see a comments section that was in any way constructive. I could go onto MSN any day and if I were to read a news story, in particular any where a young person has died from anything related to drugs or knives, and there is zero concern for the person or their family, only criticism and sometimes blatant racism. I wish people were as you describe, but I have yet to see any evidence of it.
__label__Position	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__Evidence	This Labour government will be equally corrupt....but probably on a more clandestine scale.
__label__Evidence	I completely agree with this. There are multiple exposes and car engineering shows were independent organizations show not only that we can reduce carbon emissions, but that we can also run cars way more efficiently with our current fossil fuels. If people demand the same level of efficiency with future fossil fuel using vehicles we can begin to make real changes. This will in turn give us the time necessary to begin building the infrastructure necessary for those alternative fuel sources as we will need to build electric gas stations and charge stations around the country before demanding an increase in those alternative vehicles from organizations.
__label__Evidence	a) Please stop shouting, caps are unnecessary  b) Reform have no actionable policies and are fuelled by hate, bigotry, and greed. They will do nothing for working people and the sooner people realise they're just a fringe hate group, the better. I promise you, better options for you and your loved ones are out there.
__label__Position	Security, Immigration, Housing, Jobs, Pensions, NHS
__label__Evidence	How are moderators fairly decided upon? Would newspapers choose moderators who would enforce their political ideology? I think this is a quick road to platform-controlled censorship.
__label__Position	Healthcare, public services, immigration
__label__Evidence	banning certain words would absolutely work.
__label__Evidence	I agree in general with your points. However just because its not listed, it doesn’t mean you should take the sales off and replace with non-collywestons. Please just repair them with new. (HReynolds)
__label__Evidence	It is politically incorrect  to defy people their freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Banning comment section is not a solution at all, the ban of comment sections is also the ban of freedom of speech/ opinions over all. The idea behind comment sections is for readers to share their different thoughts regarding the News with each other which is very important.
__label__Position	Put in word blocks
__label__Position	economy nhs
__label__Evidence	I agree, while I'm advocate for immigration, I feel like we really need to reign it in as we're struggling enough as it is.
__label__Position	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__Evidence	civility is better!
__label__Evidence	I agree with this, as the issue of moderating newspaper comments also crosses the gap into social media where most newspapers will post their articles too.
__label__Position	One approach is that followed by The Guardian where comments are switched off for articles about topics which tend to generate a lot of hate speech https://www.joe.ie/news/the-guardian-website-will-no-longer-allow-comments-under-articles-about-race-immigration-and-islam-528924
__label__Evidence	I respect your opinion, but there are loads of more pressing issues than that!
__label__Evidence	Although free speech is important, there is a lot of scientific evidence showing that hate speech, bullying and dehumanising language can do harm to individuals it is aimed at.
__label__Position	A mix of methods should be used - Automatic flagging/deletion of entries that include certain words, community striking, and human moderators.
__label__Position	Reform institutions to better incorporate citizen input
__label__Position	Fair funding for whales
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	rebuild schools and invest in them
__label__Position	A lot of technologies have an interface which removes certain hate words/offensive words and I believe this should/could be implemented. Or somebody needs to me a moderator and monitor the comments perhap
__label__Evidence	I think we can fight climate change I don't think it is too late yet.
__label__Evidence	Reduced number of readers because of the cost of purchase.

__label__Evidence	Trolling is human nature, it will never stop so measures need to be placed because this problem will never change unless people change.  https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Evidence	just because readers comments should be allowed does not mean that they should not be filtered within some capacity to prevent hate speech and discriminatory comments
__label__Evidence	i feel what has done a bigger impact than brexit on the services and nhs is the two year global pandemic which bascically shut down the economy
__label__Position	This is possible, in fact awareness should be brought to this topic.
__label__Evidence	It could take a long time for them to be reviewed, leaving the conversation no longer relevant.
__label__Evidence	Been the worst  crisis 
__label__Position	Many people believe that hate speech can be reduced by eliminating comments. I don't believe this works, because by removing comments, we remove a sense of common understanding as well by removing different perspectives. I agree with AliceW that hate speech can be reduced through moderation, but I disagree that it can be reduced through self-moderation, as newspapers should have an authoritative stance instead of being reduced to a forum where echo chambers develop.
__label__Evidence	In terms of the first one - I fully agree that those small boats are death traps. My main issue though with focusing on this when it comes to immigration is that it provides no context to the difference between asylum seekers (and actually providing safe routes for them) and illegal immigrants 
__label__Evidence	About “making the building useable for the occupants”. I would contend that the basis of any energy strategy, and particularly one for a listed asset, must be challenging the building occupiers expectations and requirements. This would allow a strategy to be developed which respects the asset and works with it, rather than work in spite of it to make users ‘overly’ comfortable. (Simon Candlin)
__label__Evidence	Disagreeing with someone doesn't mean that I want to fight them, it means we have opposing opinions, so I think it's totally possible to disagree in a subtle manner.
__label__Position	I feel like this is definitely the way to go about this.  I don't think taking away the comment space is the most ideal option as it feels as if your voice is being taken away. There needs to be more things in place to ensure people's safety. It's a sad world we live in these days that people feel the need to comment hate towards others.
__label__Evidence	Traditional repairs are low carbon repairs. The industry hasn’t been training the repairers of 25%+ of the stock for over 60 years. Even the very expensive retrofit of New Court, Trinity College Cambridge had problems finding skilled people (John Preston)
__label__Position	Those commenting with hate speech should be reported
__label__Position	Increasing the monitoring of comments made on a post will prevent the propagation of dangerous viewpoints and scams performed on people as no control over the content published create spaces for this to take place.
__label__Position	The integrity of politicians
__label__Position	Having a screening tool to sense the kind of speech used can be useful
__label__Position	Referendums with majority judgment will be used for decision-making and consultations. 
__label__Evidence	It would be helpful because it would discourage people from leaving unpleasant messages as they could be identified personally.
__label__Evidence	newspapers cover opinions that fit with their narrative so you cannot say that they don't portray a one sided profile
__label__Evidence	Who would do this?
__label__Evidence	I think every person I know my age who has children uses some type of informal/family-based childcare otherwise they would be unable to work due to the cost. This has to change and I completely agree with the original post that all of the efforts to solve it have been half-hearted
__label__Evidence	Doubt it but they should, striking is the only bargaining power workers have and we have the right to it
__label__Position	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are!
__label__Position	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__Position	New opoint
__label__Evidence	If you want to get your  version of the news without any context as to how it's received by the public this would be convenient
__label__Position	I was completely taken aback by  some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__Position	Freedom of speech is important but it should not infringe on other people's rights. Hate speech does infringe on other people's rights but this should not affect people who also use the website to comment.
__label__Evidence	The first and simple advice often given by one of my colleagues is “thicker curtains across window and doors” . It’s short term and achievable for residents while other interventions are in planning (John Preston)
__label__Position	I agree with Andreas that moderation is key. I think contentious issues need to be deabted and discussed as they allow people to explore more information sources, consider their position and attitudes and make (hopefully wise) changes. We need to keep people posting on open forums rather than forcing them underground into more extreme corners oft he internet
__label__Position	Counting on peoples's good behavior does not work. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/discussions/2020/04/13/community-rules/)
__label__Position	This might be an attractive business decision for the newspapers to avoid involvement with legal repercussions. This has unintended consequences for free speech.
__label__Evidence	all criticism cannot be considered hate crime, sometimes it can be the harsh truth. How can we make sure these comments don't get deleted too.
__label__Position	Removing the ability to discuss newspaper articles is not the answer. Moderation is one component but it should not be done in a heavy handed way and striking the right balance could be difficult. Hate speech keywords should be automatically blocked or removed and persistent offenders prevented from commenting. Using your real name doesn't stop hate speech, it just makes it easier for you to be found.
__label__Position	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Evidence	I think it would be a good idea to ban commenters for some time, they should be issued with the reasons why their post is offensive at the same time
__label__Evidence	As much as I would *like to* agree, I unfortunately cannot. Free speech still IS a part of free speech. I'm afraid you can't have one or the other - they are co-dependent as I believe, humans are inherently seeking conflict.
__label__Evidence	i agree with this, there are boundaries
__label__Evidence	I think the comment space should be monitored by the newspaper for a more standard approach, because a lot of people have subjective views on what hate speech could be.
__label__Evidence	I believe that newspaper articles know the consequences of any article they put up and the kind of comments that may arise from such, it is therefor their responsibility to prevent such from occuring.
__label__Evidence	completly agree
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	REMOVAL OF HATE SPEECH DOESN'T ENTAIL THAT THE SOCIETY IS NOT DEMOCRATIC.I BELIEVE IT IS SAFE SINCE NEWSPAPERS ACCOMODATES DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS FROM DIFFERENT SOCIETIES.SO BASIC NON HATE SPEECH LANGUAGE IS FAIR TO MY OWN POINT OF VIEW
__label__Position	I think a good use of an algorithm which flags for hate speech or racist language which then flags to a human. This would mean that potentially offensive posts would not be posted until validated by a human
__label__Position	Trust in delivery of manifesto
__label__Evidence	I do think that people just comment on things even if they don't have a strong opinion about it, just because it's easy to. This is why I feel they wouldn't act out in another way if the commenting platforms were taken away, as they inherently don't actually feel passionately about an issue enough to put energy into opposing it.
__label__Evidence	We're already experiencing an economic crisis. We can't just keep investing in preventing climate change. We have other priorities.
__label__Position	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__Evidence	True I totally agree. I think having certain policies in place before being able to comment will help. Look at this article here. on policies for internet companies https://www.americanprogress.org/article/curbing-hate-online-companies-now/
__label__Position	Whilst there are arguments for and against the unrestricted use of comment sections, I still feel that newspapers should retain them. They are a vital way for readers to participate in the discussion/debate. The use of user profiles (prohibition of aliases) and clear warnings that unlawful hate speech will not be published AND result in readers being unable to make any future contributions might be worth consideration
__label__Evidence	Population is the main cause  Increase in Population spoils the country  Lifestyle also needs to be changed according to the nature
__label__Position	the conservatives need to be out after the corrupt way they have handled things , i will vote labour ato give them a chance to make changes hopefully,
__label__Position	If we identify the negative feedback loops and break them, then we have a chance of slowing or even reversing climate change
__label__Evidence	I think all the parties need new leaders.

__label__Position	ban people who post hate speech
__label__Position	Set the comment to filter those using hate speech and block the troll.
__label__Evidence	I agree - some of the highest earners have been quoted as saying they are willing to pay more in tax. 
__label__Evidence	What will take place tomorrow will be theatre. The problem is the system as a whole. The real power lies with the banks and financial institutions. Whichever party is in government they are subservant to these financial powers. We need a new financial system which is not a debt based fiat system. 
__label__Evidence	Less people sign up for account
__label__Position	trying to see who can be honest about what they will do if they win
__label__Evidence	And how exactly is the government supposed to stop this? 
__label__Position	by never posting the hate speech words in the newspaper
__label__Evidence	Humans have very little effect on what can be done to eradicate such a large problem. Yes every little bit helps, but how can the poor people afford to pay the extra for environmentally safe products, etc such as electric cars.
__label__Position	I don't believe that newspapers need comments from readers. I think if this has to be the case, the comments should be submitted and then moderated before posting, with perhaps select views from each side of arguments shared, in order to discourage hate speech, spam, views from those who clearly haven't read, etc.
__label__Evidence	labour have no credible plan to stop these and human rightsd lawyers stop deportation. What about the human rights of the british people
__label__Evidence	Slow process. Subject to flaws if misinterpreted by moderators/other commenters.
__label__Evidence	100% agree punishment is becoming less and less and it needs to change and enforce the law
__label__Position	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__Position	Online comment sections provide a space for the public to interact with news, to express their opinions, and to learn about others’ views. https://mediaengagement.org/research/survey-of-commenters-and-comment-readers/
__label__Position	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14648849211069241
__label__Position	Lack of public services
__label__Evidence	newspapers can turn off the comment section, leaving people with their own concerns and comments
__label__Evidence	"Technology changes every day. Things are possible today that were unheard of just a few years ago. Who knows what could be possible in a few years, given enough inventiveness and creativity. It's not about ""current"" technology; it's about future technology -- the very near future."
__label__Evidence	Hate speach and racism could be dealt with and in time persecuted
__label__Position	I absolutely agree with this position. It is critical not to be silenced, free speech is a right
__label__Evidence	You rely on readers actually flagging inappropriate comments and not just comments that they don't like
__label__Position	Ultimately however, I think I have to agree with Patrizia. A comments section is fundamental. We must retain it, whether or not some people believe it garners hate speech or not. Personal attacks towards other people in the comments, for instance, whould not be allowed to stand. But general views, yes
__label__Position	People will become more creative.
__label__Evidence	I disagree, people that use hate speech are fully aware, especially if it is related to a newspaper article.
__label__Position	Alot of people suffer with mental health, This article makes you understand we are not alone wihen we suffer at the hands of bullies online, I think this is a must read even for those who are trying to understand the affects of mental health. https://www.verywellmind.com/mental-health-effects-of-reading-negative-comments-online-5090287
__label__Position	I think it would be a good idea to have someone or people depending how active the site is, monitoring the websites and all posted comments should be checked before being posted.
__label__Position	How to tackle cost of living and housing
__label__Evidence	Because hate speech causes so many unwanted consequences, this kind of liberal approach doesn't seem fruitful. Although education and counter-speech are important (https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence), we have to protect free speech while eliminating comments that incite violence.
__label__Position	This filter algorithm is not perfect but its name is easily remembered and if a website states that they are using it maybe contributors would be less likely to use hate speech.https://innovationinpolitics.eu/showroom/project/stop-hate-speech-with-bot-dog/
__label__Position	how about only allowing certain words/sentences to be used within the comment box, or even just emojis?
__label__Position	while newspapers can (and should) moderate their comments, more hate speech is spread more quickly on social media such as facebook
__label__Evidence	I can understand when you know that little will change under our present voting system
__label__Evidence	I worry above the Conservative mind, its a selfish mind
__label__Position	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether. Flagging certain words or using algorithms could potentially could help hide comments that don't add any value and are just trying to cause harm
__label__Position	Agreed. We need to reform the media to stop them outright lying to spur people on
__label__Position	Environment, education, taxes
__label__Evidence	and help 1st time buyers in a way that doesn't just inflate the cost of homes and increase profits for building companies!
__label__Position	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.
__label__Position	I have had enough of the conservatives was and is my main reason
__label__Position	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__Position	i have covered them already
__label__Position	I am not sure if we can fairly reduce hate speech. People can be mean and will find ways to spew their venom on others
__label__Evidence	I agree! This is truly the best solution out there at this point and time. It is scientifically proven that one is more careful about how one expresses one's feelings when he knows he is not under anonymity.
__label__Position	having freedom of speech should not give you a right to spread hatred amongst others. there are many ways to be polite at the same time voicing your opinion out
__label__Evidence	All the environment benefits can be achieved just by a vegetarian diet, you don't have to go fully vegan

__label__Position	Social media manipulation through AI
__label__Position	There's without a doubt a very high chance of hate speech taking place online in the comment sections of a website. If you want to be fair you need to have a process in place. Decided what constitutes hate speech and then implement the necessary measure to reduce hate speech fairly. It becomes the website's responsibility. They need to find out the different methods and choose the best one for them.
__label__Evidence	I believe the comment space is a place where people get really involved and there is a chance for healthy discussion. However, this is not always the case. Some troublemakers tend to post derogatory statements and use cuss words which is not acceptable. This is a drawback when using the comment section.
__label__Evidence	UK natives sitting in council houses on benefits willingly. the will never bother doing training 
__label__Evidence	There are genuine cases for benefits, but it does seem there are a lot of people not working and getting benefits.
__label__Evidence	it should be fairly obvious what differentiates between an opinion and hate speech. Hate speech should be banned and removed
__label__Position	people moaning about democracy when it doesnt fit with their ideals i'm not a labour supporter but im confident they will win an im going to accept it i also aknowledge tory gov have failed tremendously over the past 14 years but people still moaning about brexit honestly despite it being democratically voted
__label__Position	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__Position	pension commitment, NHS, policing and the armed forces
__label__Evidence	I agree!
__label__Evidence	I think it could cause more harm than good as people would find another way to
__label__Position	it should be proof read and all hate speech should be completely eliminated but people are still entitled to give their opinion on topics.
__label__Evidence	Net immigration is out of control and unsustainable, we will be bankrupt very soon.
__label__Position	Moderation of certain topics should be enforced, while still allowing space for readers for comments. I believe that there are points that can be drawn from a comment that offers another perspective, given the point is made without ill intent. That is why I believe moderation with certain guidelines that are made public listed.
__label__Evidence	Not all opinions can be respected, especially those that violate other people's rights and identities.
__label__Position	State that the editor has the final choice to print or not.
__label__Evidence	More emphasis on the smaller, daily things we can do to reduce waste would probably allow us to see change more quickly than being shamed about every product we use that might potentially be bad for the environment. Manufacturers can be a big part of that. If there are no cheap, dangerous plastic shopping bags made, then they won't be part of our homes that we need to deal with. It's definitely a group effort.
__label__Position	have an active moderator to remove any hate speech
__label__Evidence	"BASED ON: ""I think that we could read in the newspapers that there is, uh, uh. Referendum coming with a referendum, but with a majority judgment is preferable."", Person27 and ""And after you, there will be a majority judgment. Uh, who decide what we will do."",Person27 "
__label__Evidence	being ban or warned has the first step
__label__Evidence	Scientific evidence can sometimes impose itself in the long term despite initial distrust
__label__Position	One interesting argment I feel is quite important to consider, is when you are posting your comments online, does that comment come from you or could some argue / percieve that it comes from the company hosting the discussion, as quoted in this article: https://time.com/5770755/threat-free-speech-online/

__label__Evidence	this would allow people to express their views freely and in a safe and monitored way
__label__Position	not taking PIP away from those who rely on it is one reason and also children having to do national service no it is wrong 
__label__Position	https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2021/09/07/do-social-media-bans-violate-free-speech/#.Y1F1DHbMJPY The consensus of the debate seems to be not to restrict free speech, but rather to have a system in place to prevent hate speech and misinformation.
__label__Position	Not knowing who is telling the truth
__label__Position	"I think there should be a limit where this ""hate speech"" is only about the work that is done in order to be criticized. Otherwise it becomes very hard to distinguish whether a criticism is about the work or is it personal attack."
__label__Evidence	Surely these platforms could just end up filled with people who don't care about formulating a justified argument and post fake news instead. How do you monitor who is allowed to comment?
__label__Evidence	It'a difficult to filter abusive comments
__label__Evidence	I think that a lot of comments can become personal or contain misinformation that does not really benefit anyone though.
__label__Position	I belieeve we need to promote restrainment from people, educating is better than canceling because you are not solving the problem by canceling peoplle or their views.
__label__Position	There are many news sites, that have recently been found to not fact check and the apology or retraction oes not reach the level the original false article raised. I think the comments section can be invaluble to allow people to discuss and not be so one sided.
__label__Position	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__Evidence	Agreed, possibly the worst, lying incompetent and corrupt political party to form a government
__label__Evidence	Reducing animal agriculture could harm biodiversity in some areas
__label__Evidence	Free speech should be allow or we would be like communist countries
__label__Evidence	The UK government needs to lead the world in actually being firm on Israel, not just selling them more arms. Most other states arent powerful or influential enough to do anything about it, we might be able to
__label__Position	filter out widely used hate speech phrases by pre-establishing those words in the back end and also by using moderators
__label__Position	well, lets get this started. Cost of living, energy costs and the terrible state of the NHS
__label__Evidence	I don't think they do. From what I see some newspapers want to know exactly how people feel even if what is written causing a bit of chaos
__label__Evidence	I disagree with this because newspapers can lose readers due to poor interaction
__label__Evidence	I doubt that labour will be any different
__label__Position	Inflation and housing prices need to be stopped. It's getting ridiculous
__label__Position	Hopefully we have solved this issue by now. Mission accomplished!
__label__Position	Material conditions will shift towards a just society, promoting wider participation. 
__label__Evidence	Couldnt agree more as a minimum wage worker 
__label__Position	would not be right if we take away the comment section. We would be punishing people that didn't do anything or even are people trying to help others and this way would complete stop everyone from sharing ideas or even help others in need.
__label__Position	WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO DO IS VOTE REFORM. LABOUR ARE GOING TO WIN BIG TIME. NOTHING WILL CHANGE THAT. ITS A DONE DEAL. ED DAVEY WILL PROMOTE TRANS RIGHTS.

__label__Position	I believe there is a really effective solution that can be used to prevent hate speech on comments rather than completely taking out the comment space as other people are suggesting. I believe newspaper companies are always looking for feedback from their readers as to the type of content being published and its relevancy and also just to get insights from readers on different topics. The comment space is the way of engagement and you cannot publish something and not want to hear what viewers/readers have to say about it.I believe moderation of comments or having a system that is able to detect hate speech might help.
__label__Evidence	I also agree, while the Tories have been awful with regard to LGBTQ rights, I don't think Starmer has been strong enough in rebutting them.
__label__Evidence	I would genuinely love to know how you can come to this position after 14 years of terrible choices and greed-based decisions that only benefit the wealthiest in our society
__label__Evidence	It will not give people the ability to have freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	I agree with the anonymous profile comment
__label__Position	My lack of trust in the integrity and competence of the Political parties. Particulary around the economy and social care
__label__Position	The lines between hate speech and freedom of speecg and expression and constantly getting blurred further and further.
__label__Evidence	A team of moderators would have their own bias so it is not possible to know what is really hate speech.
__label__Position	There are ways to monitor hate speech online without it all being up to people having to always monitor it themselves. there is increasing technology online that can help with this https://gsdrc.org/publications/methods-for-monitoring-and-mapping-online-hate-speech/
__label__Position	Taxes, Housing, Economy, Illegal immigration
__label__Position	Any hosting of a discussion on a website is the responsibility of the host company. Managing this responsibly is under their purview. There are benefits to allowing discourse, but that does not come without dangers. Over-censoring as well as under-monitoring will both do a disservice
__label__Evidence	absolutely, they need to show that we can trust them now. they have a lot to prove 
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by educating people of the dangers of hate speech on platforms like websites and newspapers.
__label__Evidence	I would say the same
__label__Position	Closing comments is not a solution in my opinion. I think the comments are quite interesting and I'm sure there are many people who like to read comments like me. The best solution is to have people's names and surnames appear and have a control mechanism for comments.
__label__Evidence	https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/05/reader-comments-on-news-sites-we-want-to-hear-what-your-publication-does/ This article highlights what effect hate speech has on readers in the comments sections
__label__Position	KEY ISSUES FOR ME HAVE BEEN THE SAME FOR A LONG TIME. WEAK LEADER. CHURCHILL THATCHER AND I THINK EVEN BLAIR WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE TEROROSTS AND RAPISTS CROSSING AT WILL. BREXIT HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND THE COVID LIES WERE A MESS.
__label__Position	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__Position	Comments should be screened, comments that are not insightful should be removed individuals promoting hate  speech should be banned
__label__Evidence	Firtly, i think the newpaper need to acknowledge the concern of hate speech. And is importnant because we can never fully avoid it. So the newspaper should have a platform support people who are targets of hate speech.
__label__Position	there is a big issue of trust, covid parties did not help. 
__label__Position	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr!  However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior.  Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!
__label__Evidence	The only time I think it is good to eliminate comments, is if the target is harmed psychologically by it.  But I do think it could be policed in some way to offset this.
__label__Evidence	freedom of speech
__label__Position	have word filters
__label__Evidence	Free speech has a limit, and there is no reason why people should be allowed to post hate speech online.
__label__Evidence	you are very correct
__label__Evidence	I do not believe that the people writing hate comments on newspaper posts would spend time doing this, therefore, i feel like it would be a bad approach
__label__Position	yes it reduces polarisation but still takes away freedom of expression of the online reader
__label__Evidence	This article summarises it well
__label__Position	Testing 123
__label__Position	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.
__label__Position	Comments need to be checked before being sent to the public because some of these comments can destroy some public figures
__label__Evidence	They need to build more 
__label__Position	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?
__label__Position	I don't agree with eliminating the space for comments because everyone has the right of free speech, however hate speech is a real issue that I think could be solved by simply moderating the comments section, using an algorithm to filter out insulting words.
__label__Evidence	you admitted that this 'ain't true'. Although hate comments may not initially cause any physical harm, the psychological damage caused by hate comments is bad enough and can eventually lead to physical damage too.
__label__Position	more cheese tax
__label__Position	According to the United Nations, we all have roles to play in reducing hate speech. Among the suggested ways, I want to highlight fact-checking and education. When everyone begins to fact-check, it becomes easier to identify internet trolls and harbourers of bad intentions. Another great way is education. We must continually educate ourselves and those around us on the negative effects of hate speech. via https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is important - however hate speech is not important to debate
__label__Position	If people can start separating strategies to help the earth and politics, I would be more apt to believe it.   An example is the new green deal that is being proposed in the US.  When you read it, a majority is about socialist policies and overreach of the government and is not relevant in anyway to climate change.  Other agreements let large polluters like China and India off the hook while expecting a disproportionate amount from the US.   This makes me very cynical about the overall agenda behind it.
__label__Evidence	absolutely true growing more trees are the only solution to this problem
__label__Position	this discussion site is awful
__label__Evidence	"""hate speech has been identified as a common precursor to atrocity crimes, including genocide"""
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	I don't think it will make a difference. People will comment elsewhere. Fake news spreads more rapidly on social media than from the comments section of a newspaper website. I think the whole issue is being over thought.
__label__Evidence	It isn't perfect but it is a pretty decent %
__label__Position	Having bots to look for hate speech
__label__Position	The NHS needs sorting out
__label__Evidence	I think brexit is the main cause of that
__label__Evidence	Using private firms to do the cleaning and Catering was a big mistake
__label__Evidence	https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/06/role-education-address-root-causes-hate-speech-and-advance-inclusion-non
__label__Evidence	60 pluses have destroyed the planet. Time for young people to fix it.  
__label__Evidence	Newspapers tend to be one sided so other people having an opinion may benefit
__label__Evidence	Privatisation has been a disaster for everyone except the shareholders. 
__label__Evidence	Well I think we all know how badly the last 14 years have gone. I'd rather take the gamble
__label__Position	After reviewing there should be a common ground as to whihc part results in hate speech so that it gets deleted or change the writing
__label__Evidence	unfortunately it is just pure greed, rent has gone way past being affordable now, caps work in lots of other countries, so theres no reason why they cant work here. Buy to let mortgages are at such high rates, thats why rent is so high. Greed by the landlords and greed by the banks 
__label__Evidence	Media isn't about sparking debate it's about catching our attention, profiting off our attention and sharing their biased view with us. Some countries have tighter regulations for media than others as well, plus they write salacious headlines for sale knowing people won't always read the full text of the article. They cause the polarization in conversation.
__label__Evidence	People are entitled to freedom of speech and shouldn't have their views taken away from them
__label__Position	I think all comments should be moderated. Otherwise people can post things which are untrue and these comments are spread to other forums by people who don't realise they are untrue.
__label__Evidence	this is going to cost a lot of money!
__label__Position	it if not write to silence people about thing written for then. it is like forcing one to believe your story without verifying it
__label__Evidence	Fixing the root cause would be most beneficial.
__label__Evidence	No accountability by  managers at desks , with no health training 
__label__Evidence	Tell me about it! To be honest with you, I could never see this hapenning.
__label__Position	I have never felt represented by the party that is the present government. I am looking at their  achievements in terms of health and education, so I. am hoping the presnet opposition wil be moresuccessfull 
__label__Evidence	takes away the ability for people to express their hate
__label__Position	It is easy, a moderation commitee should be be set to audit comments before posting them.
__label__Position	Limitation of words one can post, both minimum and maximum; this would force people to come up with better way of criticising, meaning a less likely chance for hate speech if they have to put in some brainpower to formulate what they want to say
__label__Evidence	And these go undiscussed.
__label__Evidence	Agreed - we have a credibility issue on the world stage - too many political embarrassments back to back 
__label__Evidence	Absolutely essential for the every day person
__label__Position	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__Position	From the previous arguments, it can be seen that although removing the comments section will disallow people to express themselves, when it comes to hate speech, the cons outweigh the pro's on terms of the comment section. If the comment section exists, there should be rules and regulations to control it.
__label__Evidence	There needs to be some form of restriction on the content of speech, can you imagine if everyone was given free reigh?
__label__Position	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__Position	We cannot reduce hate speech because in as much as it is hate speech, it is still speech which everyone has a right of, if everyone respected one another we would not have this problem, having speech never created to much freedom, but losing respect for someone else is where the problem begins .
__label__Position	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__Position	I think that keeping an open space for discussion is vital and needed. Strick and easy to understand rules should be there and a group of moderators implementing them as well. We should do more about educating on media ethics, keeping freedom of expression should be combined with counteracting hate speech messages.
__label__Position	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__Position	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed. Instead a way to reduce the hate speech from escalating into something dangerous must be sourced and implemented. https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf
__label__Evidence	Based on this article which i agree with, it is essential for humans to have the freedom to express their opinions. Free speech as given a voice to many groups of people to promote positive change.
__label__Position	No. sorry i not accept Climate change is not a hoax. we also feel in real life. we need more awarness
__label__Position	Social Care, More support for children with special needs
__label__Evidence	There are always other spaces, such as reddit or twitter, where one can discuss articles- they do not have to be discussed on the same page they are presented
__label__Position	"A pop-up can be used which reads ""if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments""."
__label__Evidence	Social media allows for international communication and connection
__label__Position	I think that if we eliminate the space for people to comment its unfare and people will still comment on it elsewhere wher eit may be monitored less. I agree that making the person enter some sort of identifying info before commenting will reduce the hate speech because they will not be anonymous. This along with monitoring of the comments should reduce the amount of hate speech.
__label__Position	Have someone monitoring and deleting hate comments or automatically delete/hide comments with certain inappropriate words in them as specified by the company in charge
__label__Position	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__Position	It is only possible t have the comment section removed in order to relive audience from seeing hate peech under posted magazines. It may infring frree speech, but prodominety shall remove hate speech which can be scientifically tomrmenting to the mind.
__label__Evidence	I agree that big business is only interested in the profits they can make and not at all interested in the citizens and their welfare
__label__Evidence	I agree with this, it should be encouraged especially around political/social issues but moderation is definitely key
__label__Evidence	The disadvantage of having free speech it causes people to think it is Ok to bully, lie or name call other people and this causes more chaos and leads to more hate which is not the path that most newspaper websites want.
__label__Position	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__Evidence	It is too dangerous to allow everyone and anyone to say exactly what they like, there has to be some rules in order to protect people.  It's a form of manners that we expect from each other in every day life, and should be no different just because we are online saying something.
__label__Position	monitor comments before the are posted
__label__Evidence	It's true that hate speech is discriminatory and can constitute violence, but not all comments on news platforms are hate speech, and some are constructive. People should be allowed to share their authentic views on a subject, as long as those views do not discriminate against specific groups of people.
__label__Evidence	Where I live that is the only option in any election
__label__Evidence	Agree, it is essential to monitor hate
__label__Position	If readers are not allowed to comment on what is on the media, then I don't see the need for the media to be even there in the first place if it is not for the people or the public. The better approach would be to rid the comment section of any sensitive or offensive words
__label__Evidence	while I do agree with this, it makes me sad that our society is so soured that people cannot use self control
__label__Evidence	I fear their true colours would come out if they were ever elected
__label__Evidence	But a negative comment is not bad especially if what was done deserves to reprimanded.
__label__Position	cost of living seems to affect everyone rich and poor
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is a nonsense concept.
__label__Evidence	Physicist Stephen Hawkings  warns that we are close to the tipping point, but climate change can be reversed if the human race acts now.
__label__Position	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__Position	Bring back legal routes for immigrants with speedy processing of claims
__label__Evidence	The summary identifies challenges but does not provide specific solutions or examples of how they might be addressed.
__label__Position	Very good question, we live in a digital era now. I think the readers comments can be used on social media platforms
__label__Position	housing, education, 
__label__Position	people must change, not internet/website
__label__Evidence	I agree - I don't feel we have any real influence over this 
__label__Position	Maybe a possibility would be to ask for a minimum number of words, not to allow text in capital letters, to limit emoticons, not to allow certain words if too many, not to validate a text with too many mistakes.
__label__Evidence	This can be one of the ways a website can detect hate speech but should not be the only way. There should also be real people moderators and an ability for other readers to flag any comments that raise a concern.
__label__Position	Develop purpose-driven technology for deliberative democracy
__label__Position	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?
__label__Position	Immigration and adult social care. 
__label__Position	I believe that encouraging participation in social discussion is vital to encourage informative arguments and learning, but the moderation of these spaces is key.  There needs to be a constant check over the content to ensure no hate speech is occuring.  An AI system could do some of this work but may miss nuances.  If there is a real problem reoccuring then the newspaper could only allow people to comment if they have created an account so that these people could then be blocked if they breach the rules.  In my opinion it is not fair to remove the comment space altogether but there has to be a balance.
__label__Position	Conservatives have made the country worse over the past few years. I think a re-shuffle is needed
__label__Evidence	I think people having to give personal data will make people think before they post hate speech or negative comments.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is a platform that can violate another person in any way, all the comments should be screened in order to avoid such happening in our society
__label__Evidence	will see to that when they ban diesel altogether lol
__label__Position	"The newspaper should inform their reader what their definition of ""Hate Speech"" is, then have moderators to censor/remove comments that would be classified as hate speech."

__label__Position	It is doing the same for me
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be damaging. Removing it also gives the platform more professionality
__label__Evidence	I agree. These are all really important points for me as well
__label__Evidence	It's true that this would eliminate hate speech
__label__Position	Europe should take a more active role in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
__label__Position	Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__Evidence	Also there are skills gaps.  We should be training more people eg for NHS roles but that won't happen overnight and without non-UK nationals we would be stuffed 
__label__Position	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__Evidence	Can anyone tell the difference? Virtually the same people in different suits sitting opposite each other
__label__Evidence	"Definitely agree. We were burgled and nothing was done except give a ""Crime Number"". Apparently you are ""allowed"" to steal up to £200 worth of goods before the police attend.  "
__label__Evidence	It may limit potential information which could be spread in ways of educating people.
__label__Position	"We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against ""hate"""
__label__Position	Comments on newspapers should be there for people to voice out their thoughts about certain topics because that is the only way to learn and interact with each other therefore the should be measures taken to monetize people's comment and delete those that are hate speech and irrelevant to that topic.
__label__Position	I beileve that the algorithm discussed in the 'Most Contested Position' is the way to go forward. Allowing people the chance to express opinions, but detecting and removing hateful or offensive comments.
__label__Evidence	Agree, they have lost their way, no better than Labour, woke on speed
__label__Position	Opinions should be carefully vetted before being published to ensure that any offensive material is not published.
__label__Evidence	Reform are racist, bigoted, and have no real plans that are actionable

__label__Position	Hate speech poses grave dangers for the cohesion of a democratic society. It can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a wider scale.
__label__Position	you must run a bot system that will automatically detect and remove posts with mature language
__label__Position	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__Evidence	my next door neighbour in on UC because her income is low.  She is married, able bodied and has a 9 year old daughter.

__label__Evidence	the cons at the moment of the comments with the public are that they are not checked for swearing, name calling etc
__label__Position	Hate speech in a form of criticizing the newspaper website can be a good thing for the website to improve here and there. Not all hate speech is bad
__label__Evidence	Most expensive rail travel in Europe but it's utter garbage so I fully agree! 
__label__Evidence	takes away the ability to comment for everyone
__label__Position	"AndreasS said that we should ""educate young people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards"" which i believe to be a good point however there will still be times where an educated young person will still hide behind their keyboard and be polite, therefore i agree with his further comments to allow a subscription to ensure those can be named and held accountable however does this limit who has access to giving their comments if you have to buy a subscription and spend money to voice your views? I am for having subscriptions to voice an opinion which can be policed should negative comments be made but it should be made accessible to everyone. A differing opinion would be to completely remove comment sections as AlanU has said however to me this removes platforms for free speech which should be encouraged as long as it is not harming others, therefore in my opinion similarly to what DamianC has said about technologies to scan and detect offensive language. Personally I think a combination with human intelligence would be the best option. This is detailed in various areas online but mentioned here: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/04/09/how-should-social-media-platforms-combat-misinformation-and-hate-speech/"
__label__Position	I think its important that people teach themselves to be kind in certain situations. if people learnt to be kind , the world would be a better place.
__label__Position	"Newspapers should be neutral when reporting, however, nowadays that isnt the case and I feel they are the ones that actually instigate hate speech - negativity sells and if they can get as much reaction they will go to any lenghts to do so. In order to fairly reduce the hate speech from readers comments it has to be heavily moderated, personal details required in order to make a comment and possibly have a word block or something where the comment is replaced with ""this goes against our hate speech p olicy"""
__label__Evidence	we really are in a mess atm - can any of the parties actually fix any of these problems - or is it just the usual lies and corruption?
__label__Evidence	radical changes are needed, to stop the waste and make it more fit for the number of people it needs to serve. NOthing has changed much since it was first started.  
__label__Evidence	Good idea, where do you want to go ?
__label__Evidence	totally agree should never be condoned
__label__Evidence	Definitely polarised but can't imagine it ending well. You'll just turn it into a hate echo chamber.
__label__Evidence	Some parties will say anything and can say anything as they have zero hope of getting in.  How some expect to fund any of their wild pledges is laughable. 
__label__Position	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__Evidence	Less money has to be put into the system for moderating user comments
__label__Evidence	yes but we seem to be letting the worst of them who are not wanted in their home countries - most are comming for the money and not to try to integrate or make britain a better place
__label__Evidence	It may be difficult, but the long run cost of doing nothing will certainly outweigh the costs of doing something. The sooner we act the better our chances of making a real difference.
__label__Evidence	There are some local politicians who are definitely trustworthy, not so sure about the ones playing up to the TV cameras though!
__label__Position	Why free speech is important. https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/freedom-of-expression/
__label__Position	who is going to reduce immigration boty legal and illegal
__label__Position	There should be a moderator monitoring the comment sections, removing the hateful and/or unnecessary comments.Another person should be in charge of double checking that the reasoning behind decisions made about deleting and keeping comments is valid. There should be a standard set for comments to be allowed to stay in the comment sections. Although the decision about whether or not the comments are hateful is susceptible to subjectivity, it's a better option than leaving hate speech on the website for all to view.
__label__Evidence	Free speech cannot just be cited at every occasions when the comments people make are criminal. Free speech is not an opportunity to break the law.
__label__Position	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__Evidence	Newspapers don't have an interest in this
__label__Evidence	Agreed, we have huge mental health issues in this country and it has a knock on effect on everything.
__label__Position	I think that it is important for readers to be able to comment. I think it is unfortunately inevitable that some people will choose to leave hate speech, there is clearly no easy solution to this, but I do not think that eliminating the comments section is the answer, nor is allowing hate speech to flourish for it has real consquences. I think moderators are perhaps the only solution.
__label__Evidence	Yes people are very technological savvy and capable of using fake accounts to continue spreading whatever comments without consideration and that makes it hard to trace them.
__label__Evidence	First two only
__label__Position	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__Position	Need to review our system of economic growth. The planet cannot provide for our ubris, our will to infinite power. We must limit the objectives and return to functioning in line with limited resources.
__label__Evidence	Trolls don't really care about anything but trolling so trying to reason with them is futile.
__label__Position	This is a reasonable response to the issue with a reliable source.
__label__Position	With so many people hiding behind their virtual persona to post hate speech, it makes it hard for the organisations that run comments sections. As the article linked to below shows, such people become ever more inventive in circumventing the algorithms so organisations will have to keep up. https://www.fastcompany.com/90539275/facebooks-ai-for-detecting-hate-speech-is-facing-its-biggest-challenge-yet
__label__Evidence	I would largely agree that free speech is arguably more important than eliminating hate speech.
__label__Evidence	brexit was the single most damaging thing to happen to this country in the last 50 years. Its effects need to be remedied 
__label__Position	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__Position	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other.  Nobody has a right to comment on anything.
__label__Position	I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__Position	"I have to agree with @NormanW. People are allowed freedom of speech ofcourse, but as the term, ""politically correct""states, we have to still be mindful of how we go about stating our diffences of opinion or stances on a certain topic. If a comment is too abrasive in terms of it leaning towards pejudice, discrimination or racila slurs, such a user should atleast be issued one warning, before finally being banned from commenting on such post, if he/she were to abuse their right to comment."
__label__Position	I think by monitoring messages it would keep hate speech down. It's hard to say if a computer would successfully filter out everything, but it would definitely reduce the problem.
__label__Position	the state of the economy including issues as taxation spending and employment 
__label__Evidence	This was a great way to show what will happen to free speech
__label__Position	The NHS and the economy
__label__Position	Currently, there is no concrete law that addresses or prevents hate speech. Sometimes the law may get involved if the hate speech is perceived as a genuine threat to harm, but most of the time there’s not a lot anyone can do legally. However, just because it isn’t technically considered a crime in the U.S., that doesn’t mean that hate speech doesn’t influence society. Some have argued that inflammatory public speech increases before outbreaks of mass violence, which could suggest that hate speech is a precursor or even a prerequisite for violence. There are some historical incidents that seem to suggest this is true. For example, prior to the Holocaust, Jews were commonly referred to as rats and vermin by the Nazi party. Before the Rwanda genocide in 1994, Tutsi people were referred to as cockroaches. Words, name-calling, hateful phrases, casual racist comments - they all have an impact, especially if those words become convincing to a large number of people.
__label__Evidence	I dont even think the tories deserve to even be the opposition 
__label__Position	https://eachother.org.uk/would-removing-social-media-anonymity-protect-or-threaten-our-rights/  Perhaps hate comments could be reduced by removing the ability to post comments anonymously?
__label__Position	the only way it could work is by having a balanced team of moderators to scrutinise eah comment
__label__Position	I want prices to go back down
__label__Position	if i vote reform it will get labour in
__label__Position	Unfortunately the definition of hate speech differs from country to country and in some, they exclude certain races, certain groups, and the list go on. The UN has a guideline of what hate speech is, but again, someone commenting from another country does not really see that as hate speech, while the other do. Again, this is where AI technology is not such a good idea to moderate a platform. I do think that hate speech has become so broad in some countries that one can not say anything, or someone takes offence. So, what do one do, well, do not get personal. I agree with NormanW that they can disable comments when a topic is sensitive. That will avoid personalized comments. I agree also with JenniferP, hate speech should not be tolerated, but that does not mean you must take offence if a comment is not directed at you. Do not take every comment personal. I am the older generation, and we use to keep our opinions non personal and use to RESPECT people and their opinions. But times has changed and here we are. I still would like to see peoples opinion and agree with moderation by REAL people of NON bias status.
__label__Position	we must make sure we read newspaper that are wrote by trusted authors
__label__Position	by allowing certain people not everyone to access newspaper websites, in that way hate speech would be reduced.
__label__Position	I think there should be a definitive dictionary of hate words that is agreed by a government official and used as a algorithm to determine whether a comment is hate, they could then build on this without removing peoples ability for freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	If we are to retain these properties in use then their cost of ownership/occupancy must be made comparable with alternative properties.  Options include ongoing financial support for operating costs, affordable upgrades to reduce operating cost. 
__label__Position	I think it is necessary to be more open about people's views and comments rather than merely discarding them. I think being a little bit more engaging and trying to understand why certain people hold particular views even if they may appear toxic may help us understand them and in the process help us to engage with them and hopefully win them from such radical ideas.
__label__Position	A person should be able to intelligently share their opinion across without hate speech in public forums. There should be some sort of censorship algorithm m that filters out comments that include de hate speech.
__label__Position	although removing the comments section maybe an easy way to eliminate hate speech with will also prevent the readers from interacting and engaging in the posts
__label__Evidence	Concise opinions
__label__Position	We need a more socialist model, that cares for the whole country, not just a few at the top.

__label__Evidence	5478e52cfdf99b5322cf7f7b  Better a boring leader who carefully considers the options and outcomes  than the last few years of utter chaos.
__label__Position	Totally eliminating space for commenting is, I think, morally wrong. Debate and discussion is vital in the creation of new ideas and a fantastic way for people to explore and develop their opinions on a massive range of subjects.
__label__Position	I agree with this, in that the public should have a say in the newspaper. However, I feel, that random members of the public could be unpredictable and could comment hateful things in the space.
__label__Position	Public opinions on factual media outlets are inappropriate - Forums are are a more appropriate area for opinions and would be simpler to moderate
__label__Evidence	I agree with moderation and the need for education and increased open-mindedness and respect
__label__Evidence	Moderators have biases as well which could result in a censorship of differing opinions that do not qualify as hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree, reducing freedom of speech is never could. Using an algorithm can be quite useful, however it can open the whole  group of structural problems, when not all hate speech is treated equally. https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/

__label__Evidence	Completely agree - there's a lot of evidence out there to support this https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech
__label__Evidence	agree - too much corruption in the current government
__label__Evidence	"We shape our social lives in physical space all the time.  We now 'live' also in a digital world.  We can shape our digital lives and we must do this by not taking the ""easy"" way out, by using the tools at our disposal and by questioning and creating new tools to control our digital space."
__label__Evidence	There’s a psychological effect where being presented with information, even in the context of given facts of“this is wrong and inaccurate” actually reinforces the belief in that information if you already made up your mind on the issue.
__label__Evidence	Bulk of immigration problem is from illegal routes which the government has never been bold enough to take the bull by the horns. 
__label__Evidence	I agree, and this can be further enocouraged if the writerr or journalist engages with the comments that are being made on their story
__label__Position	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__Evidence	Yes there should be
__label__Evidence	Yes, maybe an hour

__label__Evidence	AI would be a great tool in conjunction with other moderation measures but is not reliable enough to be used on its own.
__label__Evidence	It could help address the perceived disconnect between citizens and institutions
__label__Evidence	agree. It is also well documented that it can be harmful. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a big issue on the internet and social media in general, it is a very bad idea to eliminate comment sections in their entirety. Doing this can give rise to extremist websites whether they are on the left or right. There are many ways to control it but each has their own pros and cons. At this point it is impossible to know which method is the best, the best option would be to run tests and see how the users react.
__label__Position	Cost of upgrades, which are always higher for properties in a heritage setting, are unaffordable for individual owners in low wage, low property value areas.
__label__Position	Hate speech could be reduced by having word filters and hiring moderators that stick to specific guidelines and giving users warnings about their behavior
__label__Evidence	i agree, almost impossible to get NHS care in good time too

__label__Position	You could possibly bar certain phrases or words but these need to be fairly selected and generally agreed by the community
__label__Evidence	collapsing the comment section is not the solution because people have freedom of speech however those who make hateful comments can be flagged or banned from using the site
__label__Position	Allowing bullies to have free speech is not fair on anyone reading articles who may be offended by what bullies may say. The majority in society are not bullies and should not be subjected to seeing hate speech from small minded bigots who cannot express themselves without attacking others.
__label__Position	Perhaps having hate speech detectors that are automatically deleted once someone posts. Another option would be to give an option for people to report the comment with hate speech then the comment goes through an evaluation and will be deleted once confirmed as hate speech. This therefore, allows those without hateful comments to still have a platform to say their opinion.
__label__Evidence	nope. they cannot be trusted in the slightest. in the last couple of weeks they finally realised what was going on and changed their position on several things. Too late, suckers. having taken the p*** for the last 4 years, I don't believe you for a second.
__label__Evidence	we need to protect our environment or life is going to be tougher in the future
__label__Evidence	THE FREEDOM OF COMMENTING MUST COME WITH A RESPONSIBILITY NOT INFRINGING OTHERS INCLUDING HATE SPEECH
__label__Evidence	Actually it's the Tories that destroyed my livelihood - ltd company director here, so strong disagree on this one I'm afraid. They have optimised for big business only and it hasn't worked.
__label__Evidence	eliminating space for readers comments wouldn't be a good idea on my own opinion there's people who genuinely wants to give good comments and there wouldn't be space for them to.

__label__Evidence	I agree, its best to be respectfull whether you agree with an article or not.
__label__Position	SNP, scary. Health service, education
__label__Evidence	As this topic is quite new there are some observations and guidelines from newspapers on what they do. I think there is some wisdom to be learnt from comparing the policies of diffierent companies to make a best practice.  https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf\
__label__Evidence	This is impractical for high traffic websites that will receive thousands of reports
__label__Evidence	"""More focus on place and sustainability, not just buildings"" (Crispin Edwards) "
__label__Evidence	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.
__label__Evidence	But software is not near good enough to accurately identify hate speech all the time. Language is complex and you can't pin HS through banning or flagging certain terms and phrases only.
__label__Position	My biggest issue is that the Tories have been in charge for too long.
__label__Evidence	As citizens we can put pressure on our elected policy makers to put their time, money, and funding into this cause.
__label__Position	Make it so people can only answer in relation to the article and not comment on other people's comments
__label__Position	The newspaper websites should allow only positive comments, if the comments are negative they shouldnt be apploaded
__label__Position	I feel more needs to be done to get our public services in a better condition and working again. 
__label__Evidence	Sometimes people do need to be censored, especially when it comes to hate speech because sometimes those words become actions and people get assaulted in real life. Words spoken online sometimes rally people together to take action (for example what happened in the United States when people stormed the Capitol because of fake news spreading online about the voting results being fraudulent https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/election-misinformation-helped-fuel-jan-6-capitol-attack-now-climate-misinformation-threatens-planet/ )
__label__Position	People will not be aware if they are not taught about something, awareness campaigns need to be made to teach people about the importance of avoiding hatespeech as some of them do it due to the lack of knowlege.
__label__Position	I think it should be possible to filter out certain triggerwords with AI-Programs. Sure it is not the most optimal soltion. But perhaps more convinient for the first moments in a heated conversation.
__label__Evidence	There are good and bad politicians in all parties, those who are helping themselves versus helping the country 
__label__Evidence	By 'standards', maybe certain words should be blocked? Users who continue to post blocked words eventually being banned.
__label__Evidence	I agree, everyone has freedom of speech but no should abuse it and use it using hate speech. Everybody should respect everyone's idea/opinion.
__label__Position	I think there is little to divide the parties but reforms to the benefits system, particularly PIp is worrying
__label__Evidence	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.
__label__Evidence	If we didn't have over population then we wouldn't need to build so many homes. And it's not just homes we'll need, it's new schools, hospitals, more infastructure for additional power consumption, water and sewage etc. per home 
__label__Position	People do not fully understand the power of words and the affect they have on others. Removing the comments section would provide a solution but this would also limit others from giving their fair opinion. A system should rather be implemented in which hate speech can be detected and individuals held liable for their comments.
__label__Position	"Another option would be for newspapers to introduce a ""report"" button so that readers can report hate speech. These comments can then be reviewed by the newspaper's in house ""hate speech control"" team."
__label__Evidence	This will eliminate hate speech
__label__Evidence	This would minimise the amount of time that potential hateful comments can be seen
__label__Position	why gave 16 year olds the vote ? ive got one (and i was one) and they dont know their arse from their elbow
__label__Position	Cancelling the comment section entirely infringes free speech, rather have a an option for people to report comment which they feel like are hate speech and have a team to review those comments and if a person has been reported for more than 3 times, they should be blocked from commenting in future posts.
__label__Evidence	I agree having an algorithm to delete specific words and phrases.
__label__Position	I previously expressed my position saying that I don't think the comment section of an article is necessary to keep - We don't want to undertake a monumental effort censoring or moderating thousands of comments, and I actually think the comment section of an article brings little value to the article itself, since the comments are often plagued with lies, misinformation and exaggerations. I believe the advantages of having the section doesn't pay off compared to the disadvantages, where so many people lie and offend others or start fights just for fun. Here is an article that summarizes my views quite well: https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	after going through other peoples positions i can say the filtering of hate comments might no be hundred percent effective but i still recommend it. i think the newspaper will not be nice without the interaction between the audience and the writer.
__label__Position	A moderator can check before someone's post goes in public. Like on the many forum websites.But still need to leave freedom of speech but not hate speech of course.
__label__Evidence	Human efforts include planting trees and reduction of pollutants in the environment.
__label__Position	the threat of labour getting in and putting up all taxes and not trusting labour
__label__Evidence	Education helps people understand their role as citizens
__label__Evidence	I agree that AI moderators offer an ideal solution. I think it's worth considering that having human moderators would mean that there are individuals who have to read through hate speech regularly. This research article provides more detail on this point: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/09/220916112424.htm
__label__Position	It would require a very robust means of distinguishing between what exactly can be classified as hate speech. If somebody who does not approve of hate speech quotes what somebody else says that is an hate speech. would the person quoting the hate speech be regarded as approving the hate speech?
__label__Position	Healthcare and taxes
__label__Evidence	schools are under resourced and underfunded - yet there are masses of recently qualified teachers without jobs for years. who are then immigrating to find work - seems pointless 
__label__Evidence	Here for this!
__label__Evidence	be responsible of your words
__label__Position	As social media have come to dominate socio-political landscapes in almost every corner of the world, new and old racist practices increasingly take place on these platforms. Racist speech thrives on social media, including through covert tactics such as the weaponization of memes (Lamerichs et al. 2018) and use of fake identities to incite racist hatred (Farkas et al. 2018).
__label__Evidence	Listening helps understand underlying concerns
__label__Evidence	This solves one problem - no one can then be  offended
__label__Evidence	Nhs waiting times expecially wales are disgusting . Our country can’t cope with the influx from other countries
__label__Evidence	Evidence from research (see attached) suggests that the comments section of a news article is better at creating discussion than outside sources, so comment sections in newspapers is important for nuanced discussion
__label__Evidence	Quality of life won't improve until the cost of living decreases.  
__label__Evidence	I agree with this idea. It feels like the easiest one to apply or at least to start with. From what I know, there are no algorithms applying this on newspapers, so it would still be a starting point against hatred and aggressive behaviours.
__label__Evidence	I have heard some users fear this. For instance, those who post anonymously about their sexuality or gender in countries where they may face issues in cases of hacking/user info being made public.

__label__Evidence	I agree over-censorship is a negative, but there are laws about hate speech that should be upheld.
__label__Evidence	I agree, nothing good came out of Brexit
__label__Position	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__Position	It is so important that we are able to give opinions and reactions to newspapers on their platforms. Free speech should be encouraged, not silenced. It can be moderated, and those who abuse this space should be dealt with accordingly.  https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/why-is-freedom-of-speech-important/44136
__label__Evidence	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.

__label__Position	Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech

__label__Position	Hate speech, although in many cases is specifically excluded from freedom of speech, is often difficult to regulate. In such cases then subjectivity or bias can be used and that could be seen as a violation of the right to freedom of expression. This makes the whole situation a grey area and it is only by further encouraging dialogue and conversation that can we get closer to a definitive answer on this. Here is an article that addresses the trouble with regulating hate speech.  https://www.thefire.org/is-hate-speech-protected-by-the-first-amendment/

__label__Position	I am concerned about the economy and the NHS. I think a change of government is needed.
__label__Position	Many people feel that hate speech could be eliminated by more policing of the content through moderators or algorithms; or by removing comment sections entirely. I don't either of these are the solution, as everyone will have an opinion and whether they share hate speech online or in some other outlet, I'm not convinced that's the way to manage it. I think educating people on what's acceptable and on what hate speech actually is, is important. As perhaps some people spread this negativity out of ignorance or their values and beliefs because it's how they were raised by bigoted older generations. Knowledge is certainly power. I think over policing will encourage people to act out more and moderating is a very time-consuming thankless task that really isn't valued much by people in forums and groups. Shadowing may be a better option, where moderators or even just general members of a group can hide a comment that is offensive, but the person who has written it, and their friends, can't tell that there's been any change. Where a comment is deeply toxic on a website or forum, delete and block the person. Newspapers - well, it's really down to the editor what gets published.
__label__Evidence	Exactly. It is honestly the first time we've been so close to polling day and I've had no idea what to do
__label__Evidence	The irony was nice, but for the debate it confuses more than clarifies ideas. So your opinion was a hate speech? If it was, should it be here? Otherwise, why it was removed?
__label__Evidence	I think hate pushing is wrong. 
__label__Evidence	I agree, it may be a better idea to have neutral admin who can monitor comments, rather than the producer of the article or an algorithm.

__label__Evidence	Agreed! Probably can never get rid of it completely but taking steps to reducing it is 100% needed!
__label__Evidence	There needs to be an entire rethink about how it's funded. The NHS is a ticking time bomb in terms of funding. Either taxes are drastically going to go up for people in work/other forms of tax or it needs to be partly paid for at point of use. It's political suicide for whoever crosses that bridge.

__label__Position	A combination of computerise moderation (to filter out offensive words) and human moderators can reduce such hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I think sharing ideas is ultimately beneficial and having a space to do this can help form stronger opinions.

__label__Evidence	yes it is utter chaos!
__label__Evidence	Exactly! People who fear taxes don't understand what they are for. You can't have a strong NHS without taxation for one thing.
__label__Position	I agree with the comments that worry for the effects of removing comments on free speech - we need to allow for fair and diverse debate. I don't think that newspapers should be restricting comments that are only one side of the debate, as this goes a bit too close to restricting free speech. I agree that certain inflammatory words could be prevented from being used - it is possible that people would get around this, but the fact they are having to get around something might encourage them to reflect on their decision and the reasons behind it.
__label__Position	Housing and healthcare
__label__Evidence	Absolutely correct. The important thing is to identify what hate speech actually means, because what is offensive to one individual might not be to another.
__label__Position	Cost of living Crisis - Immigation - Crumbling NHS - Corrupt politions - Water Crisis - Microplastics everywhere
__label__Evidence	But it also means that the newspaper will have full control over what is being posted and can filter certain opinions as well as hate speech to create a biased community look if they want to. Since they would never go on air, there would be no history of the page you can compare to.
__label__Evidence	I disagree that newspapers should be one-sided providers. Newspapers are often aligned to certain political parties, and that is not necessarily made clear! Readers may not realise they are reading biased news stories.   Comments should be allowed so that alternative points of view can also be aired.
__label__Evidence	Sometimes computer algorithms get things wrong
__label__Position	it would be good to put in place trigger words to help stop hate speech being loaded onto the site.
__label__Position	I think removing the comment space will be of a disadvantage in terms of getting the engagement that the newspaper needs. Criticism doesn't always mean hate, however, filtering and censoring words will be the best option.
__label__Evidence	law enforcement could be notified easily
__label__Evidence	to disallow readers comments is an unnecessary response as these communities can still be found elsewhere
__label__Evidence	disagree, chat feature is useful
__label__Position	By blocking comments with offensive words related to the topic, and banning individuals who constantly engage in hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I disagree. Democracy cannot progress if others are punished for the misdeeds of a few people. A headache simply will not be solved by cutting the head off. Other devices such as comment monitoring and elimination can prove useful.
__label__Position	This is a test. This is what Chat GPT said ... In general, the role of leadership at an educational institution like the Open University typically involves guiding the strategic direction of the institution, making decisions that affect the overall mission and goals, overseeing administrative and academic functions, and representing the university to various stakeholders. Leadership positions may include roles such as the Vice-Chancellor (or President), Provost, Deans, and other executive or administrative roles.

__label__Evidence	AI may also let hate speech slip through the cracks.
__label__Evidence	I think my idea is good
__label__Position	Could one option be that the owners of websites which allow commenting have to ensure - by whatever means - that instances of hate speech are dealt with in a certain time once reported or that they reduce it altogether by a certain amount otherwise they incur fines or suspension of the site.  So they have to sign up to a policy or code of conduct or pratice?  Although this link is about disinformation the principle is the same.  https://digi.org.au/disinformation-code/
__label__Evidence	immigration is such an excuse especially said by the prime minister who's son of immigrants, we all move around the world, British too!
__label__Evidence	Yes, they deserve to be out.  But I fear you will get far more problems from Labour when they get their teeth into things.
__label__Position	Certain guidelines should be set and regulated to ensure they are being followed. Just as is done on plenty social media platforms. Any instances of prejudice or hate speech whether meant with no harm or ill intentions should be removed. Also an approval system can  be set in place, so comments from readers can go through a filtration system before being posted.
__label__Evidence	eliminating space for readers comments? is that the right approach?
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours 
__label__Evidence	Hates speech does not automatically equate to freedom of speech. In fact, often times it is a violation of many human rights. In that case it should be removes so as to protect the people that would otherwise be harmed by those hateful comments.

__label__Evidence	That will just give newspaper websites the opportunity to publish fake news without anyone challenging them (https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/journalism_fake_news_disinformation_print_friendly_0.pdf). for example, if they post fake news about covid, no one will challenge them and anyone who doesn't have enough information will believe what the article says.

__label__Position	There could be some kind of vetting process although this might not be practical - it would probably be too difficult to check each and every comment before allowing it to be posted. The other approach, apart from a basic check which blocks posts containing known 'hateful' words, is to rely on other users to report unacceptable posts and block the original poster. This isn't foolproof either as said poster can easily sign up with another email address and come back. It doesn't really seem like there is an easy solution and although it's not ideal, maybe preventing comments altogether really is the only way?

__label__Position	Have some moderation but allow a platform for healthy discussions to take place
__label__Position	The issue with hate speech is how it affects others and as nice as it seems to be able to destroy it at its root by re-educating those who commit hate speech, it is more important to help reduce the wide spread effect of their hate speech as that can be faster to do. e.g., having morderators that check over comments that have flagged language. only then can the people who resort to hate speech should be dealt with by having strikes and bans to their account which wouldn't conflict with their anonymity. However, censorship is also a concern, Who decides what is hate speech and what isn't?

__label__Evidence	no engage from the readers
__label__Position	Rent prices also need to be capped. They are capped in so many other countries
__label__Position	"While comment moderation might be helpful for reducing hate speech, if human moderators are involved, it will be necessary to consider their wellbeing as well - one study found that ""people moderating uncivil comments on news sites decreases their trust in the news outlet and increases their emotional exhaustion"". https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/07/hey-comment-mods-you-doin-okay-a-new-study-shows-moderating-uncivil-comments-reduces-the-moderators-trust-in-news/"
__label__Position	Focus on mental health services addresses a critical need
__label__Evidence	Agreed, it's totally problematic once you start to censor opinion over simply bad language and obvious hate speech.
__label__Position	I think the reform party has not helped. they talk a good game, with no substance
__label__Evidence	Would provide personalized, relevant information to citizens
__label__Position	Newspapers should make it mandatory to register a profile for a user to be able to make comments on the newspaper's comment section, in that way the newspaper will have the information of those who perpetuate hate speech. The users will then be banned from the platform and if the case of hate speech is extreme then legal action should be taken against the user.
__label__Position	I do agree that Hate Speeh can be an issue. Removing the ability to make comments for readers would stop. Maybe some form of vetting comments prior to publishing would help the situation.
__label__Evidence	lets hope the next government isnt as corrupt
__label__Evidence	There needs to be a strict line between 'Free speech' and 'Hate speech'.
__label__Position	Voting this time is going to be a difficult decision, very few MP's care anymore, all they seem to do is argue & bicker and try to get one over on their 
__label__Position	Block any hateful words so comments can’t be left
__label__Evidence	Could not agree more
__label__Position	Director, Scotland
__label__Evidence	OR we can try a a semi-automatic, holistic approach. I mean, it is important to let people talk about what they want, the comment section is an important place, where people can communicate. But some kind of moderation will be always needed. I find this study interesting: https://aclanthology.org/W18-4420.pdf
__label__Position	Cost of living
__label__Evidence	all lacking. need to tax the mega corporations and reinvest in our NHS schools and housing
__label__Position	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself. 
__label__Evidence	I totally agree with you. Adding that the comment section must remain closed until the education of the people takes effect. Remembering that the learning process takes time to complete.
__label__Evidence	I agree with your opinion. I think trying to find ways to moderate the comments (either automatically or by a team of humans) would be a good step. Then it's also up to the responsability of the users themselves  to have a good attitude.
__label__Evidence	Most newspapers are inherently biased so you can't really trust them to handle hate speech
__label__Position	it feels like everything is broken, which lets people like Farage scapegoat immigrants and minorities. I'd like to see the sate functioning properly and hopefully then it will take the wind out his sails and we'll never to put up with hearing bluster ever again.!  
__label__Position	The Environment
__label__Position	Climate change is a priority
__label__Position	And the Govt must give rewards to those who do activities to protect the environment.
__label__Position	I believe that comment sections should be moderated for comments that meet criteria for Hate Speech, while keeping as many comments as possible live. People must be allowed to express their opinions.
__label__Position	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__Position	The NHS, Cost of Living, Scottish Independence.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this comment. I really would encourage people to educate other people about the consequences and reasons behind hate speech. These factors might contribute to reduce it
__label__Position	low wage rises
__label__Evidence	Beneficial to the masses.
__label__Evidence	There are those that are going to use the platform to incite hate and this should be moderated with them being banned if identified
__label__Position	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__Evidence	I am pretty sure some sort of hate speech itself is an infringement of ones human right and somehow defies what democracy stands for so it still does not lead to the necessary democracy either
__label__Position	Another useful article where comments can be turned off if the reporter or the broadcaster will know that the article will cause heated comments from readers:  https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf

__label__Evidence	I agree, this is a very measured resoonse.
__label__Evidence	i agree, people who repeatadly post negative hateful comments need to have suspensions and bans
__label__Position	We can eliminate hate speech by allowing proper and thorough covering of every story. Often these articles are inaccurate or have a hidden agenda which makes the readers angry about the misinformation. Education about ways of proper communication without use of violence online would also reduce the amount of hate.
__label__Evidence	We have had the same crowd in charge for 14 years. Time for a change.
__label__Position	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__Position	want to stop the seriously right wing suge
__label__Position	The EU should take a more active leadership role in the peace process
__label__Position	Research in computer science addresses phenomena, such as toxic comments (van Aken et al., 2018), offensive language (Chen et al., 2012), abusive speech (Nobata et al., 2016), or profanity (Sood et al., 2012). Hate speech is frequently – but not always – used as a synonym. Equating hate speech with offensive language is insofar problematic as a comment can be offensive without referring to a target group. When scholars consider this group reference in their definitions, they often concentrate on explicit racist terms or consider other characteristics (e.g., religion or sexual orientation) that are used to stigmatize groups (e.g., Davidson et al., 2017; ElSherief et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2016). But researchers who use ethnic slur lists seldom distinguish between user-generated communication addressing individuals or generalizing derogatory speech to a whole social group. The main goal of computer scientific research is the automatic detection of hate speech in large quantities of data. To classify hate speech, one can choose a deductive approach, using dictionaries consisting of lists of ethnic slurs or category-specific swearwords. An issue regarding these keyword-based approaches is the nature of language. It is never static, the degree of formality and tone changes depending on the platform where user-generated content is published. Additionally, users adapt their writing or choice of words quickly to avoid censorship.    (https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm)
__label__Evidence	It really depends on what type of personal data is being shared. I strongly believe in privacy because people can be crazy.
__label__Position	I think there should be consideration for free speech but appreciating that free speech does not allow for people to contribute hateful and harmful hate speech. I don't believe free speech equals hate speech but offering opinions with the intention of not producing any harm to any person or group. I think it is compleetely fair to remove hateful content and I think the idea of reachin g out to those who have offered harmful content is good, but is limited when put into practice.
__label__Evidence	I couldn't agree more!
__label__Position	Maybe filter through comments
__label__Position	Hate speech is always misinterpreted by very sensitive people who don't like to confront certain major issues , especially if these issues are personal to them.
__label__Position	Readers comments are an important space and whilst it's possible that people use them for hate speech, others use them to express informed opinions and for healthy debate.
__label__Position	Making a user provide personal details to create an account and comment is both a good and risky idea. It is good as it means that people are less likely to comment hate as they are not anonymous and can be held accountable. It also helps prevent the creation of bot accounts which are often used to spread hate speech and false information. However there needs to be something in place to ensure this data isn't sold, used inappropriately and is kept secure and safe. This is a lot of work for newspapers so they may be unlikely to do this and just resort to turning off comments.
__label__Position	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__Position	Hate speech should not be tolerated on any platform.  But in reality we are never going to completely get away from it.  However we need to find ways of eliminating it as much as possible
__label__Position	I agree to have moderators and have key words flagged up and not allow certain words that can accelerate arguments. Have an email option to send in points of view that can be published for readers to be able to read a balanced view of a debate.
__label__Position	NHS and confidence in the government 
__label__Evidence	Anyone but The Conservatives or Reform 
__label__Position	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between  violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__Evidence	This works if the media had some guidelines to go by, otherwise everyone's level of what would be allowed would be different.
__label__Position	I think people should be able to express their feelings, but there should be a way to block hate speech
__label__Evidence	Brexit created the belief that problems go away if you spout B/S. Boris has a lot to answer for. 
__label__Evidence	Its hard to type when it keeps jumping up 
__label__Position	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__Evidence	The NHS definitely needs to have more funding and improved
__label__Position	I want a party to stop the illegal immigration via small boats, help with the cost of living problem, address the care problems and the NHS and do more to help the environment and clean water. 
__label__Evidence	Crime against people is statistically lower than it has been for a long time. This just isn't true. Have you ever been a victim of crime? 
__label__Position	It is a lost cause, guys. I gave up long time ago
__label__Evidence	Removing comment spaces completely reduces social participation which is super imporrant for educating others.
__label__Evidence	Agree, shameful stuff
__label__Evidence	I think you have hit the nail on the head here!
__label__Position	I believe one way to reduce hate speech is to have a 'report' button on the comments section, where people can flag up certain comments to the site's admin people, who can decide whether the comment is inappropriate.
__label__Position	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set
__label__Position	Use keyword decipher software and refer to a human rather than rely on AI.
__label__Position	That would take away free speech, however I think they need to add some sort of AI that can immediately pick up any forms of hate speech and immediately delete or even block it
__label__Position	I had more problems with tony Blair lying about weapons of mass destruction than I do about Covid rule breaking. The politicians had to carry on working during covid and the parties were just a group of workers having food  al fresco. 
__label__Position	"readers are always reading for knowledge of something new, something exciting and adventurous and this sometimes make them want to ad more to express their feeling to the writer. These feeling will not always be seen as good comments because some people are born careless about other people's feeling and they write as they please. I say this platform  called ""bcause"" already has the perfect option on how to use the comment section perfectly and this is to use the option of ""PROS AND CONS"""
__label__Evidence	I definitely agree on the part of sciencing valid criticism
__label__Evidence	Same. I would love to see some robust, costed and thought out policies but everything seems slightly same-y and not particularly detailed
__label__Position	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	too many people on it who dont need to be. I know a lot and dont blame immigrants cause the majority of people i know are brits 
__label__Evidence	We need to start somewhere as people will just carry on if nothing is done
__label__Position	I always find it frustrating when a newspaper or other online media doesn't have a comments section. It just cuts you off from your audience. Hire somebody or somebodies to moderate. That's all you need to do. It's  not rocket science.
__label__Evidence	That was COP25, I believe in this discussion we are trying to focus on COP26 
__label__Position	Immigration stance and the economy
__label__Evidence	yes, also the bettings around the next election dates, disgusting to think these people run our country and think they can do whatever they like 
__label__Position	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__Evidence	Loop holes need to be closed for corporations. We should not be double taxed, on our earning and on our savings and on inheritance tax. As essentially we are paying 3 lots of tax one one income.  
__label__Position	We should focus communication efforts on the middle ground rather than extreme positions
__label__Position	Views on Gaza and what's best for Scotland
__label__Evidence	Education about hate speech has been around and people still practice hate speech
__label__Evidence	"I really like the idea of working groups. This fosters more informal and free discussion, and makes the exercise more interactive. We could be ""itinerant"" facilitators. "
__label__Evidence	I agree, it is just what I said.
__label__Evidence	Technology is ever changing. Maybe what we currently have cannot make lasting change, but it can make a change in the right direction. As technology updates, we can do more. I think it's more of an issue of becoming willing. 
__label__Position	Fixing the economy, building more houses, being credible internationally
__label__Evidence	how do we mute these comments? Cencorship?
__label__Position	Who will actually have a chance of getting in
__label__Evidence	"""@ Bill, Wales’s multi-year Optimised Retrofit Programme is decarbonising thousands of socially-owned homes and monitoring the outcomes, technical, social and economic. I hope in time we will learn lessons that answer your question.""  (Chris Jofeh)"
__label__Evidence	couldn't agree more. We should eradicate homeless. 
__label__Evidence	Discussion will always happen. This would encourage discussion to happen elsewhere in forums without direct reference to the news article or without any moderation. It also pushes discussion into social media platforms where discussion tends to be more polarised and less productive.
__label__Evidence	There is some evidence that AI systems can be pretty effective at detecting hate speech! For example: https://ai.facebook.com/blog/how-ai-is-getting-better-at-detecting-hate-speech/
__label__Evidence	We live in a democratic country and so, everyone is entitled to their opinion.
__label__Position	have certain discriminatory words banned or hiden from being used at all, any comments thats unclude those banned words would then not be posted for failing to meet guidleines?
__label__Position	I have no knowledge to share, but perhaps I can use that positively by posing a few 'stupid' questions:  - What are the threats to heritage buildings from climate change? - What are the threats to climate change from heritage buildings? 
__label__Evidence	Posistive for who? One of the reasons for comment section is to promote socialising amongst readers not just or the newspaper itself
__label__Evidence	I agree , however strong moderation to the comments very quickly could work.
__label__Position	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__Evidence	Automatic filtering technology can be improved continuously and I think it would reach an adequate level of censoring without limiting freedom of speech. Some social networks like Instagram already give an option for users to select if they want to see hate speech or not
__label__Evidence	The Israeli side is not ready to engage in real political negotiations
__label__Position	This article tagged below explains the cons of hate speech on articles. https://ethics.journalists.org/topics/hate-speech-and-actions/
__label__Evidence	The removal of the comment gives a clear warning to contributors that hate speech is not tolerated and that if they use offensive language then their opinion will not be heard.

__label__Evidence	The cost and amount  of management  in NHS is a scandal
__label__Evidence	Housing is definitely a big issue in this country- same as overcrowding. Unfortunately working in the construction industry the situation is harder too and not many developers are able to provide as much (which is normally 10-15% handed to councils from new developments) ore money needs to be put behind construction industry and help for councils as they also make things difficult from housing/built perspective 
__label__Evidence	limitations are important.
__label__Position	we need tax revenue topay for servises we can1t expect good infrastructure and effective public services for free
__label__Position	Hate speech can and does stop genuine free speech. This article implores us not to read the comments as they can stifle the voices of minorities. https://theconversation.com/dont-read-the-comments-misinformed-and-malicious-comments-stifle-indigenous-voices-180576

__label__Evidence	Enabling colleagues requires agile systems and processes, or change and improvements to existing ones, within a timeframe where inspiration is still present. Otherwise it can lead to frustration.
__label__Position	I believe regulation of the comment space is the way to go. The likes of introducing a down rating of a comment and a comment with high down ratings if and only if is about hate speech then is removed and the user get to be blocked from accessing the platform
__label__Position	Set out clear rules for commenting, moderate the comments and remove those which don't adhere to the rules.
__label__Evidence	They have been completely self serving and have failed this country dismally.
__label__Position	There is some evidence that when hate speech increases in comments sections there is a difference in the linguistics used. Perhaps it would be possible to use artificial intelligence to pick up on this quicker than a moderator could.
__label__Position	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__Position	Immigration, the NHS, Mental health, housing, dental care
__label__Position	the code could be written to exclude certain offensive words. comments including those words could be prevented from being posted
__label__Evidence	very much agree on cost of living issues!
__label__Position	Use automated algorythums
__label__Evidence	100% The Tories have been destroying the country for 14 years now. This narrative that Rishi needs more time is ludicrous  
__label__Position	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__Evidence	the mod can even alert the authorities should they feel the hate speech warrants law enforcements
__label__Evidence	The welfare of the masses should be prioritized 
__label__Evidence	I think people are completely aware that they are spouting 'hate' messages, they just don't care. Education is a total waste of time. They are bullies.
__label__Position	This is an interesting article on the outcomes of several news agencies that disabled the comments section. Some of the writers of articles were getting subjected to abusive messages.  This would be another argument for verified profiles only allowed to access the websites with their real names and details.
__label__Position	This is a complex issue. While websites should do their best to counter hate speech, some see this as curtailing freedoms. However, freedom ends at the point where hatred fuels harm. I think the platform should strictly moderate the comments sections and remove posts that are deemed hateful and ban those making them.
__label__Evidence	Negativity
__label__Evidence	It has been normalised that the web is space for hate talk and privacy to say anything, but why did we make this the norm. If it's something you wouldn't say in person then don't say it at all.
__label__Position	Economy, NHS and environmentls issues
__label__Evidence	I agree this would helpfilter some of the hate speech
__label__Evidence	yes, and don't remove all post, just the part that contains what is termed hate speech,
__label__Position	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__Position	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior.
__label__Position	If eliminating readers comments is out of the question, then it must be that hate speech is recognized and removed before a comment is even published. People use the free speech argument but free speech isn't 100% guaranteed in cases of speech causing harm (e.g. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre). Hate speech causes harm.
__label__Position	Aswell as moderation could potentially block people who have written hate speech or unsavoury language on these articles.
__label__Position	Filtering out comments and blocking out the hate speech before it's published can help reduce the hate speech
__label__Position	what an idiot the lib dem leader seems
__label__Position	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__Position	Highlight the bad speech so we openly discuss it more
__label__Position	We need to reform the voting system so people are better represented. Unfortunately that will mean more seats for the far right, but things need to be fair
__label__Position	Correct ,technology is the need of today's humanity  but it should also help the nature side by side
__label__Evidence	Its unlikely there will be such software that recognises all slang / racist words
__label__Evidence	This can make it easier to ban an IP address
__label__Evidence	I feel we are going backwards with LGBTQIA+ rights and need to ensure this is not allowed to happen. 
__label__Position	make it so
__label__Evidence	It is hard to rely on awareness campaigns, as people who write hate speech are not very interested in any awereness campaing
__label__Position	https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options
__label__Position	I think it is important to consider setting rules such as no hate speech if found then you will be removed. In this way it will limit hate speech.
__label__Position	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__Evidence	seems to me to describe management as much as leadership and too generic and not HE specific.......
__label__Evidence	I agree, Article 19 of the ICCPR guarantees the right to freedom of expression but also disallows discrimination. Restricting any sort of speech violates the right to freedom of expression and can be utilised by leadership or publications to discriminate. https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights
__label__Evidence	There must be some sort of check not censorship
__label__Evidence	Companies strategically and purposely try to shift the blame and responsibility onto individual consumers. We need regulations and government intervention to force change on a larger scale, or companies will continue to irreparably damage the environment for short term profits.
__label__Evidence	Banning comments only based on keywords will remove certain comments fore sure but won't help in reducing hate speech

__label__Evidence	Imagine how terrible we all would feel if we made the planet cleaner for everyone only to find out it was a hoax?
__label__Evidence	Are you voting for less immigration or a different methodology of how we currently do it?
__label__Evidence	I'm not sure how voting a particular way helps cost of living, Electricity/gas/water prices are set by the companies, food prices are set by the retailers. the government doesnt control these things.
__label__Position	By monitoring individual responses and removing those not deemed suitable for publication
__label__Evidence	Readers would ust become more comfortable because it now seems like a platform that has been opened for them to spread hate speech.
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is interesting tackled in this article: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/online-stubbornness
__label__Position	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__Position	Having a bot reduce hate speech again would need to be programmed by a human, this human would need to be in an unbiased position to do this. In this day an age it very challenging.
__label__Position	Looking closely at each party's candidates histories, as well as their stance on the Palestinian Genocide. The party's stance of the environment, and how they plan on helping the country move forward with more sustainable energy is also important.
__label__Position	Free speech is a hallmark stance with any respectable democracy. Rather than eliminating readers comments, instead readers should be reminded that care should be taken to deliver their opinions with respect. It is never necessary to use derogatory language or expletives to get a point across. Otherwise, adults should be allowed to engage one another in discourse without the fear of their comments being taken down or censored.
__label__Position	Hate speech does not belong anywhere - but it is unfair to cancel or eliminate readers comments because people can not behave. a Automatic block should be placed on the site
__label__Position	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__Position	Another article which covers how linguistics can change in hate speech is here - https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3394231.3397902. I think this is useful and I would like to see if that could be used across online newspaper comment sections.
__label__Evidence	YES
__label__Evidence	https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/what-is-an-echo-chamber/1/ most of human suffering has been caused by some form of misinformation and fear tactics, now its digital and ambient.
__label__Evidence	everyone has the right to share their opinions, however online comments make it too easy for hate and discrimination to be spread with out consequences. There needs to be a way to stop the hate spreading but also still give people the oppertunity to express their comments so i think this is a good idea
__label__Position	I think websites can also try to filter out words that represent hate speech, so that when a person types the word out, it automatically declines to send their comment.
__label__Position	It is obvious that something needs to be put in place to reduce online hate speech in comment sections. The below article shows how this can manifest as realworld hatred and violence. Surely newspapers have the obligation to step up and do something about this. https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/
__label__Position	I agree but don't see prices going back down once they are up they rarely go down more than a couple of pence
__label__Evidence	People may not be trusted to keep the hate speech moderated.
__label__Position	I do agree with this, especially the screening by charities or organisations, but I would add unbiased independents (as long as they were competent).
__label__Position	yes I go with the statement saying If governments around the world treat climate change collectively - the same way they treated World War 2 for instance - then is possible, no matter the cost 
__label__Evidence	It's the politicans who are pseudo Brexiteers who weren't totally behind it that messed it up. Give Farage a chance. Can't be any worse than the ones we've had so far 
__label__Evidence	Absolutely - and it is essential that these behaviours are addressed through better education on diversity and inclusivity.
__label__Evidence	Why do people read comment sections? To get informed and enlightened or because they are nosy and killing time? I think most of the time is the latter. I am not sure the comments expressed at the bottom of a page bring more value to the conversation than they bring potential offence, hatred and fights started just for the fun of it.
__label__Position	It is actually very depressing from so many aspects. When you consider how this country used to be a beautiful place, much of the urban life is being destroyed, and Labour will not have a single clue.
__label__Evidence	That is a great suggestion, that way, we all get to voice our opinions and the newspaper doesnt censor the views of their readers.
__label__Evidence	okay yeah during the pandemic certain policies that were negative were passed and stuff and mistakes were made not disagreeing with you on that however the hate for brexit just cause you lost is kinda too much and the things it gets blamed for when there has been a large pandemic is quite alot 
__label__Evidence	hate speech can be controlled by way of manual review or even bots programmed to look out for flagged words
__label__Position	The comment section should not have been removed but filter to remove anything that involves hate speech or entices violence, as this limitation revokes people of their freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	This would create issues of illegibility and would only create more confusion as to the user's intent when the comment was made.
__label__Evidence	This can be a very good 1st level of filtering, and maybe if there are situations which are red-flagged in high intensity, they can go through a human vetting process also.
__label__Evidence	"I agree. Some for of moderation is needed. Users should have to agree to some sort of ""anti hate speech"" policy when signing up and accounts who violate the policy (by posting hate speech) should be banned. The moderation can be done similarly to how social media platforms such as Instagram allows users to filter out certain keywords from their comment section and any comments with those words do not appear in the comment section as seen here  ( https://help.instagram.com/700284123459336 )"
__label__Evidence	I agree, I can't understand why they've managed to stay in so long
__label__Evidence	I think the writer can decide
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	I believe that freedom of speech is every human being's right, if it infringes on the human rights of another person then hate speech should be moderated. That being said it now begs the question as what is considered hate speech and the people who moderate the comments consider hate speech as.https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793?cookieSet=1stated in
__label__Position	From what I can understand, this problem can be solved by setting very clear rules of what is allowed and what isn't. To reduce hate speech we should set clear rules that prohibit comments related to racism, xenophobic, homophic, transphobic, sexist... behaviour as well as comments aimed at individuals which may comment on their appearance, personality, etc. Criticism which is constructive should be allowed as this is just someone's opinion which deserves to be heard
__label__Position	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__Evidence	True, we need to increase technology to deal with this problem. 
__label__Evidence	But the major newspapers are already owned by large corporations who have vested interest in political parties and financial matters. It is hard for liberal or independent news to break through the noise. Comments help to balance the conversation.
__label__Position	i believe what should be prioritized is the permanent removal of the comment section. i also believe that people do not need to learn further about hate speech. people already know which comments are harmful and which comments are not harmful which is why they keep throwing those comments every chance they get. i stand with the take of eliminating the platform to comment and that will solve the solution. or the comment section should have moderators who can approve comments before they are posted.
__label__Evidence	It may prevent recruitment to these groups of people who may hold similar views or brainwashed into accepting false theories
__label__Position	I don't think you can reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without having a large team checking every post regularly or moderating posts before they appear in the comment section.  Even if you eliminate the space for readers comments the hate speech will still happen, they will just find somewhere else to post it
__label__Position	NHS, cost of living, immigration, international conflicts
__label__Evidence	i hope you realise the number of people coming on boats is tiny. The media love to use this tactic to make you hate the wrong people 
__label__Position	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using  both AI and human intelligence
__label__Position	The climate change is the major issue in the current environment so we need to protect our environment by controlling the air pollution.
__label__Position	Instead of completely removing the comment section, it should be censored and regularly monitored.
__label__Position	One thing that is clear is that we can't just remove the comment section. Researchers have found out that this is not a good strategy at all. For further reading you can check out this article: https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/10/research-proves-that-removing-comment.html
__label__Evidence	It doesn't matter whos in power, they all sing off the same hymn sheet 
__label__Evidence	Whoever wins will need to invest a lot of money. Which will probably mean a rise in taxes.
__label__Position	We can eradicate the anonymity of commentators so that they can understand that they will be held accountable for their comments.
__label__Position	The comment section is a good way to be interactive  with the public and creates a community where discussions can take place and people get to exercise freedom of speech. However if not regulated it could cause harm because people use it for hate speech
__label__Position	Public services
__label__Evidence	I agree, both such important issues
__label__Position	Allowing the right to strike.
__label__Position	The manner in which questions are  asked on newspapers should be directed enlightening for a solution and positive response.
__label__Position	I fear going back to the 1970s when fiscal practices made the UK Bankrupt
__label__Evidence	This allows for people to understand that something will be done if they conduct hate speech.
__label__Evidence	hateful opinions are not opinions
__label__Position	Hate speech should not be tolerated but its curtailing should not be prioritised over freedom to comment. Ultimately, private companies (online newspapers) are free to restrict comment sections in any way they see fit but ideally we should be allowing free discussion with a robust moderation system in place.
__label__Position	I'm not seeing other positions so at this point I cannot provide a summary of my overall ideas.
__label__Evidence	reduces freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is a probelm, and to discredit any potential help is not the answer. Trials and attempts could be made to fix this issue. A good way to do so would be to use human modetors who are netural, to ensure that there is fairness.
__label__Position	Please read this article - https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/
__label__Evidence	Exactly, it's a slippery slope when a system is doing all the work https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__Evidence	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.
__label__Evidence	Disagree! people should be abl eto express themselves in a respectful manner.
__label__Position	People who share hate speech can have their comments removed and their accounts banned from the platforms
__label__Position	I believe that any information platform should be a neutral space where people (readers) can be allowed to express their opinions. People will always disagree or have uninformed perspectives and silencing them is not the answer. I think that most hate speech is usually fueled with misinformation, bad experiences and emotion. Hence these platforms could be used to expose and address these views.
__label__Evidence	It would discourage racism/xenophobia
__label__Position	quality of life .. cost of living, social care
__label__Evidence	I think over the past few years the UK has become bit of a joke on the world stage. We need to build up our credibility again for sure! 
__label__Evidence	Yes, and also also others to report. If many report, the moderators will take a closer look.
__label__Evidence	I agree but what is to be done about those who use hate speech? Do we just let them be? And what about the newspaper's reputation? Should they be known as a newspaper that allows people to comment on whatever they like with no repercussions?
__label__Evidence	Th Un have argued that we need to address hate crime https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Position	it worries me this just goes round in circles and nothing ever really changes no matter who we vote for
__label__Evidence	not difficult, would say need more work and maybe more money spent in discovering something new
__label__Position	I support labour but find starmer creepy
__label__Position	I think people should be encouraged to give personal comments however they need to be monitored to ensure hate speech cannot be seen which might negatively impact others
__label__Position	i think people need to be educated better about what Hate Speech is.
__label__Position	I'm totally against hate speech but I do believe in freedom of speech so therefore I believe the way forward is to have moderators regularly reviewing the comment section.
__label__Position	Could setup a forum so that people can comment there and not directly under the comments. Then moderate the forum?
__label__Position	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__Position	Some newspaper websites make it difficult to find the comments section to reduce the risk of hate speech. I had difficulty finding the comment section on the sun: https://www.thesun.co.uk/ and this may be because it is one of the more controversial newspapers and therefore they expect hate speech so hide the comment section well.
__label__Position	One reader said its ok to eliminate the comment section, I do not agree with them because we need to hear other peoples views on the topic and it can only be done in the comment section.
__label__Evidence	I agree a screening process could be effective in filtering comments.
__label__Position	The most surprising position was to completely eliminate the comments section. various studies have been conducted in this regard and they all agree on one thing and that deleting comments is not a good idea and can damage the general perception of the outlet. https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/
__label__Evidence	More social housing
__label__Position	There are many ways newspapers can reduce hate speech from their comment sections. Software to identify hate speech keywords. Making users register their details before posting. Blocking users who engage in hate speech. Setting out a clear of rules around conduct in comment sections. A report button so readers can report hate speech. Human moderators to ensure nothing slips through. Using these methods newspaers can  allow the public to have their free speech while at the same time protecting people from hate speech online.
__label__Evidence	Not a big issue. You're brainwashed by right wing media distracting you from the real issues 
__label__Position	Is it a democracy if there is only a choice of two and one is a gamble.
__label__Evidence	If the platform is held accountable for allowing hateful speech, then this would set an example to others, both platforms and people, and eventually there would be more control over this happening freely.
__label__Position	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__Evidence	Exactly as they did the last time they got into power - they will ruin the Country again 
__label__Position	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally
__label__Evidence	Privacy issues. I know that my information are already somehow online but no one would be willing to give them freely, with the risk of being persecuted.
__label__Evidence	Easy to do
__label__Evidence	Do have a look at stbauk.org, the Guidance Wheel, “Planning Responsible Retrofit” and our other publications. (John Preston STBA Heritage Chair)
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is not free speech when it can lead to attacks on people and how they choose to live their lives.
__label__Evidence	Social media platforms are far from perfect at dealing with hate speech, it may even be detrimental because it would allow a lot more people to comment and therefore a lot more hate could potentially be displayed
__label__Evidence	I wish people would stop jumping on the bandwagon describing Reform as racists. Sure they have a few bad apples associated with them but have you taken the trouble to check out how many ethnic minority candidates they have standing
__label__Position	define hate speech,  write it is not allowed where comments are and provide moderators to remove any posts which contain it,
__label__Evidence	blocking certain words could automatically delete comments that are not necessarily hateful to another person
__label__Evidence	I think the fact that Facebook, one of the richest companies in the world, struggle with moderation points to the fact that small local newspapers would struggle. Especially if one of their stores goes viral or something.
__label__Evidence	People will tick that they agree, but write what they want anyway! And if they're anonymous there are no repercussions for them.
__label__Position	I am worried about drive to EVs as infrastructure not in place
__label__Evidence	"""Starting in the middle: we don't demolish anything without justification, should be less driven by designated heritage status"" (Steven Bee)"
__label__Evidence	Algorithms also have issues and can be inherently racist: https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/18/21121286/algorithms-bias-discrimination-facial-recognition-transparency
__label__Position	online newspaper will definately attract a lot of people if there is comment section as some people prefer to go through comments first to get insight of the content.
__label__Position	By allowing people to be educated regarding this topic, it will surely enforce a more positive environment. Attached is a link informing beneficial information regarding the subject. https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf
__label__Evidence	Recognition would help level the playing field in negotiations
__label__Position	Cost of living, Europe, Scottish Independence, Human Rights
__label__Evidence	Agree  - More pay for people who help others. Less for those who help themselves.
__label__Position	I agree with the article that reducing freedom of speech is not an appropriate response to rising hate speech - filtering the comments via moderation or an algorithm is a way to allow freedom of speech without giving rise to hateful or discriminatory speech.
__label__Evidence	Nothing
__label__Evidence	If a newspaper does not do anything, it might facilitate hate speech and help it reach to millions of people by simply hosting it on their website. Therefore there is a responsibility.
__label__Evidence	yes it seems to be working for me 
__label__Evidence	Is there a country that you think does immigration well and that we should model? 
__label__Position	Put a trigger warning on the paper advising readers to not read ahead because the content might be offensive. Also having filters so certain words
__label__Position	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.
__label__Evidence	I believe that newspapers are supposed to spark a conversation, the conversation should be had directly in the comment section and should not be moved to different platforms
__label__Position	Perhaps a team of moderators could be required, either with the power to approve posts that are waiting for approval, or by reactively monitoring.
__label__Position	Instead of eliminating space for readers to comment, newspapers can introduce strict rules on what is and what is not acceptable and have readers agree to those rules before they comment. They should also state how disregard of those rules will be handled e.g. banned from the site. Should readers post hate speech, the newspapers then have every right to follow through with the next course of action, whether it is to remove the comment or ban the person. Free speech is still important as long as it doesn't cause harm to others.
__label__Evidence	The fact is that the knowledge on climate change is still very limited. Assumptions that we make about the damage today could be disproved tomorrow. Take for example the holes in the Ozone. We discovered them with advances in technology, but no one is really sure that we caused them or even for how long they had actually been there. With advancements in technology there is little reason to believe we can't reverse some of these things. 
__label__Evidence	Stop unnessacary hate towards people
__label__Evidence	I just hope that if Labour win, that Green will get some seats to hold the government to account  
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree, I feel that we are probably fairly used to sifting through the rubbish on the internet, and at times the trolls can be entertaining, as long as it isn't nasty.
__label__Evidence	There is no way that the Whigs will ever be a major Political Party
__label__Position	All users that sign up to have access to a websites comments section should agree to a declaration before having this option made available to them. If they then go on to violate the declaration and post hate speech their speech will be made unavailable for others to view on the site but will be used against them when they are prosecuted by the newspaper.
__label__Position	I recognise that the comments can generate very divisive view points and generate much tension. Persons should be allowed to speak freely, but there needs to be balance.
__label__Evidence	Good Argument but at the same time we must look at how it affect people live most people commit suised because of hate speech
__label__Position	If i was to vote I would go labour as that is how i have always voted but I am still not sure if I will
__label__Evidence	Newspapers role is already to sell information, censorship can be done without doing comments with hate speech.
__label__Position	Creating algorithms to detect hate speech is not straight forward. There are a lot of types of detection systems/algorithms and each have their own pros and cons.  An overview can be found here:  https://vitalflux.com/hate-speech-detection-using-machine-learning/
__label__Evidence	"""Measures proposed that are inappropriate to building pathology"" (Crispin Edwards) "
__label__Position	by having professional unbiased moderators
__label__Evidence	Comments are still there for free speech.
__label__Position	The hate speech would obviously be reduced. However, if the comment section is totally removed, the rest of the comments which are important for knowing the opinions of the readers would also be removed.
__label__Position	Healthcare is very important. The NHS is failing
__label__Evidence	My main concern with labour is that they can cross boundaries that the Tories then exploit when they get back in. Labour introduced tuition fees, Tories hiked them. I fear that something similar could happen with the NHS this time round.
__label__Evidence	It is still difficult because then you are removing everyone's entitlement to an opinion
__label__Evidence	those 3 are still the 'legs' of sustainable development as far as the NPPF (July '21) is concerned.
__label__Evidence	This would be a lazy attempt to reduce hate speech as it doesn't allow for people to make genuine, thoughtful expressions of opinion that is useful for others to read.
__label__Evidence	That would reduce hate speech
__label__Evidence	everyone is affected
__label__Position	Getting inflation back to 2%
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is not acceptable and this would help to prevent the  possibly of appearing online.
__label__Position	Creating more money by taxing the richest earners more
__label__Evidence	I agree with you. I don't know that there is a good solution.
__label__Position	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__Evidence	Where is this magic money tree, please tell me, I would love to know.  Doctors do private work which they get paid for. If everyone strikes then it has a knock on effect on everything else. 
__label__Position	It's also useful to identify what constitutes hate speech as what one person finds hateful, another may not.  Understanding why certain speech is deemed hateful by the vast majority is also a useful tool in this discussion. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Evidence	yes cost of living important these days 
__label__Position	One way to possibly deal with hate speech on newspaper websites would be to have moderators that work around the clock monitoring for hate speech and removing such hateful comments and banning those people that engage in hate speech.
__label__Evidence	It's absurd though that we need to tactically vote, and shows that there is no point in having other parties at the election. 
__label__Evidence	Some may feel undermined.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is impossible for a human moderator to read every comment and react quick enough to an offensive comment before it has been read by other commentators.
__label__Evidence	Definitely the system has to change, Labour are going to get 38% of the vote and have 200 seat majority.
__label__Position	"factors that are merely based on ""scam reports"" or when someone reports an individual for wrong content just by selecting certain options, which are many generalization "
__label__Position	Nearly all countries have hate speech legislation. There are certain things you are not free to say and rightly so. There is an onus on Newspapers not to let their websites be vehicles for people to spread hate speech. Strict moderation is needed and these days it is relatively easy to implement. There is no need to get rid of readers comments sections.
__label__Position	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__Evidence	inflation is declining and CPI is back at 2% currently
__label__Position	Asking for their constructive criticism and how it will benefit the individual and community.
__label__Position	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website
__label__Position	cost of living crisis and basic human rights
__label__Position	Maybe they can have an algorithm or ad admin who checks and approved the comments that don't have any hate speech or have certain words barred
__label__Evidence	Citizens may lack sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions on complex budget issues
__label__Position	"""Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the ""casualities"" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved."
__label__Position	A person who post about hate speech should be either be given a warning but if he/she continues then that person will have to be  suspended or removed from that curtain website/platform
__label__Evidence	What is hate speech? 
__label__Position	Immigration, taxes, climate change
__label__Position	I'd like a full focus on the NHS.  Help support our healthcare professionals.  Not really bothered about immigration.
__label__Position	the environment, Labour at least has a policy
__label__Position	through active and responsible paritcipation into the deliberation process.
__label__Position	Reduce Taxes
__label__Evidence	the creators are humans they could be biased and use ai to make what they want
__label__Position	the fear of a labour landslide
__label__Evidence	I doubt Starmer is going to go for this, I hope he does though, but he has been taking a lot of 'gifts' from the rich lately, people trying to get him onside.  
__label__Position	Readers comments are often divisive and poorly researched.
__label__Position	the comments with hate speech can be remove. and the commenter should be ban for a period of time
__label__Evidence	"Free speech should trump hate speech because hate speech can also be interpreted as political speech where by dissent of the prevailing political and cultural agendas are not accepted or an attempt is made to use ""hate speech"" to create a stigma around political agendas that are unpopular."
__label__Position	There has to be teams of employees working with the newspaper that are checking what has been said and deciding whether certain comments need to be removed. I don't think getting rid of comment boxes is the answer, just careful monitoring and banning of accounts that use hate speech.
__label__Position	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__Position	newspapers can invest in software that will filter offensive words.
__label__Evidence	Agreed, do not increase tax, Inflation is bad enough without wages increasing to reflect it
__label__Position	I believe that comment sections should remain open, but should be monitored and flagged for key words or harmful messages. Having a space to respectfully critique or share add on ideas allows readers to continue to think critically about the article at hand and form educated opinions considering both sides or an argument.
__label__Position	NHS, economy, govermnent incompetence and corruption.
__label__Evidence	"Not really sure how you can do this? Are you basing track record on ""all of time""?!"
__label__Position	I believe a mixture of AI, and human moderation is needed to help the situation. Comments are needed in newspaper websites.
__label__Evidence	They are a business and therefore hold the control over what is said in their comments.
__label__Evidence	I agree with you. I don't know that there is a good solution. 
__label__Position	Illegal immigrants and something being done about the millions of people who are struggling to make ends meet.
__label__Evidence	The pollution of our rivers is an issue for me, too
__label__Evidence	Guidelines and some automation (i.e. flagging the use of key words associated with hate speech, including swear words and racist nomenclature) could work.
__label__Position	We need to establish individual flight quotas. For example, one long-haul flight per person every 5 years
__label__Evidence	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts.
__label__Evidence	That's a very selfish view
__label__Evidence	I agree. However, policies that educate people on how to deliver their speech is imperative
__label__Evidence	Exactly what is needed is taxes to increase on large companies to pay for Public services their employees use. 
__label__Evidence	neither much to do with govt - global issues
__label__Evidence	They don't represent my views
__label__Evidence	i agree that it shouldn't be removed everyone has the right to say how they feel about situations and people sholud also think about how their actions affect others.
__label__Evidence	We live in democratic countries where views of ordinary citizens matter. So yes def there must be comment sections
__label__Position	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.
__label__Evidence	Automatic filtering technology can be improved continuously and I think it would reach an adequate level of censoring without limiting freedom of speech. Some social networks like Instagram already give an option for users to select if they want to see hate speech or not  
__label__Evidence	even if it were criticism not all criticism is valid and should deserve a space
__label__Position	100% cost of living is a big one for so much of the population!
__label__Evidence	Surely arguing and debating is the whole point. Otherwise how do we thrash out a plan of action? Find out what other people think and why?
__label__Evidence	Violating the right to freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	I don't think this is about negative and positive comments but limiting someones ability to spread hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Everyone has a different interpretation of what could be aggressive. The soultion would be to remove the comment section and people can go to many different forums if they want to discuss articles
__label__Evidence	Economists argue that immigration is good for an economy 
__label__Position	I think it is possible to reverse climate change, if we do reverse our consumption habits. Though it will take time.
__label__Position	position
__label__Position	let's have a picnic together
__label__Evidence	only farage will solve this :)
__label__Position	Exactly as BobP states, if you can have competent moderators then there is no valid reason to eliminate the space for readers comments. Genuinely competent moderators are skilled enough to delete, block, ban or report individuals who abuse comments.
__label__Evidence	Flagging comments would be good
__label__Evidence	comments can dilute the validity of the story
__label__Evidence	The way to circumvent abuse of flagging is to create consequences for it. Being banned from the comments section in increments of time until someone is eventually permanently banned for too many infractions
__label__Position	Conduct of Tory government in office, illegal immigration, policing of 'non-crime hate incidents'
__label__Evidence	Thank you! Some hate is seriously not necessary
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Report those who comment using hateseech and ban them from said platform
__label__Evidence	I agree,that way people aren't bullied online.
__label__Position	We need to reimagine and redesign policy and decision support pathways for sustainable food systems
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses 
__label__Position	I agree, People will just add comments to anything these days, with no real knowledge of the subject.
__label__Position	There should be no option to log in without providing some form of ID so people posting harmful hate speech can be tracked and prosecuted.
__label__Position	hate speech should be regulated as it can be harmful to others. See the following article to back this up. Theil, S. (2019). “The Online Harms White Paper: comparing the UK and German approaches to regulation” Journal of Media Law 1.
__label__Position	In terms of readers posting a comment on a newspaper website, they should be informed on what the newspaper website sees as hate speech. Things will be clear from there
__label__Position	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__Evidence	If we try to make a serious attempt we can definitely reverse the harmful effects.
__label__Evidence	numbers dont lie but the politicians do , knowing full well what they are saying is far from the truth 
__label__Position	free speech is important and we should be giving people the opportunity to be giving their opinions, I don't think that eliminating a comment section would help with to eliminate hate speech, people will just go else where with their speech, what we should we should have is a moderated comment section, peoples posts can then be moderated before it's aloud on the platform and of course there should be a report button so anything that does get through can then be reported
__label__Position	It can be done by taking into consideration the feelings of the people who will get to read the newspaper. The person or persons that will be responsible in writing the newspaper must know what will and will not hurt the people who will be reading the newspaper.
__label__Evidence	Is central heating appropriate for many historic buildings (and the notion of wanting to maintain 19+ C) in these buildings? Do we need an alternative approach to the provision of thermal comfort? Should we aim to heat the whole building or just a few rooms? (Richard Lorch)
__label__Evidence	Also difficult to ensure that humans won't make mistakes and overcensor
__label__Position	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__Position	Words and phrases that could be offensive should be banned from use in the comment section. Comments left on a post could be verified to be safe by a moderator before they are publicly visible to others.
__label__Evidence	Banning IP addresses could prevent users from a whole house or area being prevented from contributing
__label__Evidence	too scary to contemplate
__label__Evidence	Continued settlement expansion has made a contiguous Palestinian state impossible
__label__Position	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__Evidence	people may still use illegal identification or find a way past the barriers
__label__Position	Hate speech online requires different strategies for different platforms. Facebook vs. newspapers. Youtube vs. LinkedIn. Twitter vs.  a specialised forum etc. All have different userbases and customs/habits that those users are accustomed too. There's no 'one size fits all' fix. We have to think specifically about newspaper websites - who's using them, how are they accessing them, what sorts of comments are the ones cropping up the most.
__label__Position	The internet has enabled the sharing of ideas and viewpoints we would not have otherwise have encountered. We can't allow a minority of people to ruin the richest source of opinions and ideas we have ever had access to.
__label__Position	There are some excellent suggestions in this study,which also raises the issue of freedom of speech also being freedom to hate. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Evidence	Trying to address multiple audiences can make messaging too bland
__label__Evidence	I agree that the establishment will have too much power, and not be fairly represented if fair negative opinions are seen as hate speech
__label__Evidence	Agree, price of food items is so much higher than a few years ago
__label__Position	I am worried about defence spending. We are no longer in the best position to defend our country
__label__Evidence	"""Tradtional skills training as part of a building conservation project has shown to be a successful approach"" (Peter Cox)"
__label__Evidence	It's extremely hard to draw the line. Surely someone being extremely harmful and discriminatory can just claim 'well it's free speech' ?
__label__Evidence	Agree, need a fairer distribution of resources. But are Labour bold enough to tackle this? 
__label__Evidence	Despite this there is woefully little work done to date on behaviour change and mobilisation within diverse groups, specifically in relation to ethnicity and disability
__label__Evidence	I am not sure if this will happen 
__label__Position	Improve EU foresight capabilities
__label__Evidence	I agree that we have to try. There is no quitting.
__label__Position	The hate speech would obviously be reduced. However, if the comment section is totally removed, the rest of the comments which are important for knowing the opinions of the readers would also be removed. 
__label__Position	I think that newspaper websites should not disable the comment section they should monitor it and remove anyone spreading hate or conspiracy theories regardless of this whole freedom of speech thing newspapers should have the power to ban anyone spreading bogus news,
__label__Position	I need to trust my politician
__label__Position	have an AI to scan and analyse trigger words, then the alert is passed to a human reviewer then can say whether or not it's hate speech
__label__Evidence	It would also not allow the writer to see if the public like what he/she is writing.
__label__Position	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__Position	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__Position	to reduce hate speech it is important to raise the stakes of what happens if you are caught. scientific evidence and criminological theory shows that if someone perceives greater risk in their actions, they are more likely to desist.
__label__Evidence	Labour haven't said what they are going to do.
__label__Position	A difficult question and I don't believe there is an easy solution.
__label__Position	Destroy the Bank of England and jail the theiving scamming frauds that run it 
__label__Evidence	I agree, I'm a soon to be new parent & the lack of support there is for childcare or paying insane prices for nurseries etc means that we're being forced to work without spending too much time with our child.
__label__Position	Think about it life has not been on earth as we know for a very long time, maybe 50- 60 thousand years. The earth has been around for what a trillion years. So what will go first. Lets call it what it is, not attempt to save the earth but to save life on earth. I am pretty sure the earth will be here long after life has been erased from its surface.
__label__Evidence	AI is the way to go for sure since there it's not human-based
__label__Evidence	I agree - inflation rates are also going up much faster than our salaries. It feels like a lot of us are stuck in quicksand. 
__label__Position	Don't use racial slurs, give limited space.
__label__Position	I think newspapers website are not used as much now, as most people will use social media to comment about topics.
__label__Evidence	"""Local planners, architects,  engineers, and local homeowners should be working together to develop local archetypes that can set homes on their own journey to net-zero. We proposes a new local approach to reach net-zeto with the help of retro-fit design."" (Chris Jofeh, Consultant to Arup and Chair of the independent Decarbonisation of Homes in Wales Advisory Group)"
__label__Position	We should not mistaken hate speech for freedom of speech. Trollers and mean people do hide behind that. Have we thought about the consequences of hate speech like suicides?
__label__Position	Well..hate speech is a problem then there is freedom of speech as well. There is a possibility a writer is giving valid points.
__label__Evidence	absolutely, punishment should be given more often (within reason of course)
__label__Position	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__Evidence	I agree on the usefulness of a report button.
__label__Position	you can't
__label__Position	Need to get Tories out, NHS, the economy, tackling poverty, tacking climate change
__label__Position	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Evidence	yeah .. there should be notification if somebody answered your question/opinion 
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech is significant and readers must be able to express themselves negative or positive it is their right. Hence the need to keep the comment section but flagging or blocking users who make use of hate speech is a fair action to take.
__label__Position	Provide a reminder to commenters that ensure all comments to remain civil and that some people may not share the same opinion, and that is okay.
__label__Evidence	"Personally speaking I think that is more what is swaying my vote than ""Labour deserves a chance"""
__label__Evidence	If we need other peoples opinions before we can form our own then we are literally just looking for confirmation bias of what we already believe
__label__Position	Should make it impossible for someone who has been blocked or flagged from posting hate speech to create another account to stop trolling.
__label__Evidence	They'll reduce the VAT threshold and cripple small businesses
__label__Evidence	Most self serving govt I have ever seen and I am 60
__label__Evidence	agree brexit is a disaster, but thats democracy? cant change it because we didnt like it. we voted for it (i didnt, but the collective we, did) 
__label__Evidence	Additional administrative workload and time factor for posting comments
__label__Position	"Younger people are susceptible to propaganda by the establishment ""elites"", they will be easy targets of manipulation by saying that ALL opposing views are ""hate speech""."
__label__Position	Tax the rich more. It will be interesting to see if Labour (the party of the people) do this but I doubt it!
__label__Position	Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__Evidence	Education is k ey!
__label__Position	I believe that removing the comment space from the online newspapers is definitely not a fair choice in a democratic society. Democracy advocates for the inclusion of all members of society, including their views on any issues. However, it does not warrant hate speech and online bullying. The best way to reduce hate speech can be to find an IT solution that can automatically block users that utter hate speech on the online platforms
__label__Position	The economy
__label__Evidence	hate sppech exists wheather in a comments section or not
__label__Evidence	"Calling on the denegration on other people is not ""Having an opinion"" your view is your own, and you can have it, however when that overlaps into criticising other people for no other reason than they are differrent is not a ""view"", it is bigotry.  So there needs to be some form of moderation."
__label__Position	Hate Speech can be very problematic as it may lead to some people even taking their lives. Filters, flags for harmful words or speech should be used to try and prevent hateful comments and such comments should be immediately removed
__label__Position	The Crime rates need to be lowered. Enforce the police force & have stricter rules
__label__Evidence	Spot on
__label__Evidence	but the newspaper cannot be liable for how people respond,considering that most website are visited by adults with responsibilities.
__label__Position	Housing, immigration, jobs
__label__Evidence	does take a lot of work/ man power or bots which could over filter comment sections
__label__Evidence	this will encourage strives among the community
__label__Evidence	I believe that too much damage has already been done by governments around the world especially due to geoengineering tactics that have already caused harm that cannot be reversed.
__label__Evidence	agreed - though given statements on all three of these issues I've got little faith in either of the two main parties. 
__label__Evidence	Why are you not prepared to think there is an alternative. Why do we have to put up with the illusion of choice. When a system is broken why would we look for a solution to that problem from within that same system? We need to think bigger. 
__label__Evidence	I saw economists backing labour 
__label__Position	It looks as if Donald Trump will win the election in the US in November, and he wants to disband NaATO, which could threaten global security. The UK has been isolationist recently with out withdrawal from the EU, but Starmer will need to work hard to keep NATO together and restrain Trump
__label__Evidence	you should get a postal vote if you are not around on the day. it is a shame to waste your vote
__label__Evidence	This is unlikely to be feasible.  United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php
__label__Position	This article on civilrights.org discusses the fact that hate speech is pervasive and how we can all start to combat it. https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__Position	no
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__Evidence	Totally agree with your point on crimes, immigration less so as I believe the lack of legal immigration routes has led to an influx in illegal. It's significantly caused by the Tories's inability to handle foreign policy and immigration
__label__Position	If the moderation system is not well done, it is better to remove it but I think that it is better to leave this discussion space as long as moderators are present
__label__Evidence	"But hate speech hurts. We can't let it just run rife because  it's ""too hard"" to address."
__label__Evidence	if one matter is not given enough attention than that would have bad consequences as if might not reach a lot of people
__label__Position	People commenting with hate speech should be fined
__label__Position	inflation, NHS, taxes, minimum wage, poverty, crime
__label__Position	tests and trials should be conducted to collect data on user reaction to hate speech
__label__Position	It's honestly depressing how we've been having this discussion for almost a decade. This article offers a great deep dive: https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Evidence	Generic and slightly focused on positional 'senior' leaders rather than the leadership role everyone can step into.
__label__Position	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.
__label__Position	I have taken most notice of the party leader to be honest in this election
__label__Position	my most concern is living crises and NhS long waiting list
__label__Position	I want to vote similar to my friend's and family
__label__Evidence	History and recent events have shown that there should be limits to free speech
__label__Evidence	people get lazy because you get benefits to sit on your arse, cut benefits to bare minumim and increase tax free allowance. people would soon find a job
__label__Position	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__Position	Should be reviewed first before it gets published
__label__Position	If comments section is removed because of dominating hate speech than another option should be provided to constructive users. An option to send opinion pieces and letters should be available
__label__Evidence	I've found this is quite a common position 
__label__Evidence	those PPE contracts need investigating
__label__Position	Anyone got any comments on tactical voting
__label__Evidence	the same as my idea
__label__Position	Newspaper websites and media houses do not hold the responsibility of policing or censoring as they can easily manipulate such to their favour.
__label__Evidence	You are right. The problem is slowly growing which is why we need to take steps to address it now. 
__label__Evidence	Where I live there is a lot of upset because people on the waiting list for Council Housing are being given much less priority than, for example, 
__label__Position	Once again, I think this comes down to thorough monitoring and censoring of specific words. Additionally, having an option to report a comment would be beneficial so that attention is drawn to that comment and can be reviewed by a third party to see if it is appropriate. Perhaps if there were many issues and after a period of time it was being found that more harm than good was being shared in these sections, that they may have to be removed.
__label__Position	The voicing part, i think its gonna cause disaster
__label__Position	Hateful comments can have a real impact on some people. It is important to have a strong algorithm and moderation team working together. Right now there are loopholes that allow people to get through the computer system that humans can fix.
__label__Position	Short answer: you can't. 'Hate speech' is a vague term, and what one person considers 'hate speech' might not be the same as someone else's.
__label__Evidence	less ideas generated
__label__Position	Reform institutions to better incorporate citizen input; fkjgjkfj
__label__Position	Tax policies aim to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share.
__label__Position	The economy, NHS and environmental issues
__label__Position	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__Evidence	I understand your point but I think you're misinterpreting the point of this. Hate speech is damaging and should not be condoned in any form, regardless of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech includes allowing people to talk about their opinions, but not threatening people or expressing prejudice against certain groups.
__label__Evidence	Thankfully, Scotland has a different choice.
__label__Evidence	what do you propose we do about that?
__label__Position	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance
__label__Position	The climate change is the major issue in the current environment so we need to protect our environment by controlling the air pollution. 
__label__Position	People first environment second. Youth may be the future, but there are still 60 pluses about.
__label__Evidence	this is just a response with no constructive information. We cannot just say this, throw up our hands and walk away
__label__Evidence	strongly agree with andreas
__label__Evidence	But I don't see what they can do , in the short-term at least. The govt is screwed as it's built up billions of debt (and the BofE had to bail them out thanks to Kwarteng's budget). They need to raise money somehow, so that has to be through taxation, but to suggest a plan that wins voters from all sides is tricky 
__label__Position	Maybe if the comments were better moderated then this would reduce the amount of hate speech.
__label__Position	trans healthcare, attitude towards palestine and policies on climate change
__label__Position	"In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to ""teach"" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all."
__label__Evidence	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem but cause further frustration. It also takes away the opportunity for people to engage about issues and share ideas.
__label__Position	Perhaps vetting people more thoroughly would be a solution?
__label__Position	equality of opportunity/shared wealth
__label__Evidence	None of the above solves nothing. At the end of the day someones going to be elected, abstaining means you should be fine with whoever gets elected. To me it's choosing the lesser of the evils
__label__Evidence	That is an interesting point. It would need to be an impartial party. I know sometimes FB and other social media platforms use algorithms to hide certain posts (usually due to language) so maybe that could be one answer?
__label__Position	I think Rishi's approach that support for buying houses shows his lack of caring around the housing market. Young people don't need a few thousand pounds in stamp duty relief., they need affordable housing and better paying jobs to afford them.
__label__Position	Other issues include past performance of the conservatives, can you trust what they say considering their previous track record
__label__Position	There are many ways newspapers could use to eliminate hate speech from their comment sections. Methods such as software to identify keywords, moderators, having to register to comment, a report button, blocking users who post hate speech, and a clear set of rules displayed before posting. Using these systems should eliminate hate speech from comment sections while still allowing the public to have their say.
__label__Evidence	It is happening due to some natural causes too. Technology can't stop the natural course of things.
__label__Position	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__Position	Also immigration issues and how we are going to deal with the problems in a fair way.
__label__Position	The economy, the state of the environment and ensuring that taxation is fairly distributed.
__label__Evidence	Let’s be careful here. There is loads of evidence that being too cold indoors is bad for health. We should not be aiming to have the life expectancy/population health of earlier centuries just because old buildings used to be cold. (Gavin Killip) 
__label__Position	support for small businesses/self employed
__label__Evidence	I am generally in favor of giving an opportunity to the opposition in such a situation. This way, at least we ensure that leaders are held accountable and do not feel invincible.
__label__Evidence	I agree we need more council houses
__label__Position	removing the comment section is not a solution to addressing hate speech. The important is not censored viewer comments but to censored hate speech. there are a few options to consider to address this:
__label__Evidence	However it could be argued that t it is so difficult for moderators to see the difference between someone practicing their freedom of speech and the idea of hate speech against a protected characteristic.
__label__Position	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__Evidence	And who would be removing these comments and how do we know that they do not have other motivates behind trying to remove the comment.
__label__Evidence	https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/#
__label__Position	NHS - waiting lists, dentistry etc, Social Care, public services and community
__label__Position	NHS, University tuition fees, Mental Health Support especially for children with special needs
__label__Position	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__Evidence	Very much agree with this - we need growth to afford better services
__label__Evidence	I think appointing moderators for this task is quite costly and it will be based on the subjective opinion of the moderator. Interference will prevent freedom of speech and will be a bit biased.
__label__Position	the honesty of the parties and what theyre offering to the country
__label__Evidence	Automatically hiding comments flagged inappropriate may promote hate speech as well, as coordinated groups may flag comments to target and suppress the speech of specific people.
__label__Evidence	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed? (In order to avoid publishers becoming reliant on retrospective fixing, rather than their initial checks - which are where the problem originates).
__label__Evidence	I don't think these are all realistic goals. 
__label__Evidence	Farage is a grifter, appeals only to the gullible.
__label__Evidence	This could be costly depending on how many articles there are to review
__label__Evidence	Two cheeks of the same backside, We need stronger third options but first we need the party of brexit out.
__label__Position	it can be done
__label__Position	Newspapers should definitely not censor users but should come up with other measures to restrict users with malicious intent. Such mechanisms can be only registered users being allowed to comment and for the comments to be public. Mechanisms such as AI bots which trace keywords that promote hate speech can be utilised by newspaper agencies.
__label__Position	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. If they choose to be anonymous do not allow them to comment.
__label__Evidence	I think moderation is better than asking for a lot of  personal data.
__label__Evidence	I like this idea - there could also be a warning system for those reading the comments, if something does get published that possibly shouldn't have. A warning stating that the following comment may be offensive and contain hate speech.
__label__Position	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__Evidence	Perhaps if there was some form of verification to reduce the hate speeches rather than eliminate free speech completely
__label__Position	There must be a team of moderators, who constantly look at new comments being posted, and approve them to be visible for others, or remove if inappropriate.
__label__Position	Have a list of words that are banned from social media sites.
__label__Evidence	difficult to judge hate speech
__label__Evidence	Yes there should be restrictions in the form of vetting comments before publishing it
__label__Evidence	Who determines what is and isnt hate speech?
__label__Evidence	I like this way of thinking. Allow everyone to comment however only a few comments are shown. Comments that are not hate speech
__label__Evidence	I agree slightly, it is good to see what others think unfiltered.
__label__Position	It is clear that the issue is not going to be resolved either quickly or easily. Hate speech should be met with a zero tolerance attitude. Until however the issue starts to become monitored effectively, things will only then improve and give an indication of how to move forward.
__label__Position	There are a number of important stakeholders in this work and a fast growing body of emerging good practice ion the UK and elsewhere. It will be hard for people to keep up to date with this and people working in one area (e.g. climate and the built environment) may find it hard to follow other areas. it would be helpful to have an online repository of key information that could develop out of this initial discussion. But some organisation or agency will need to step up and host this.
__label__Evidence	I agree, we need to be brought to seeing things from different angles and possibility of discussion is actually a good thing. Raising awareness on hate speech is key and should be taught from a young age.
__label__Evidence	Why should private schools get a tax break? They are not charities. Use the money raised to help further fund state schools where 93% of pupils go. 
__label__Evidence	Immigration may well be too high, but it's very difficult to quantify the effect that mass immigration has on the economy because there's so much misinformation out there
__label__Evidence	who decides how the moderators moderate? This is too much power
__label__Evidence	Definitely not Labour, their councils have destroyed my area and the surrounding area. I don't want the country to go the same way. 
__label__Position	How will you all be voting?
__label__Evidence	The media is based on the idea that they have the freedom to write or speak about any topic they wish. To take that same idea away from other people to respond and contribute freely to what is being said would be the end of a diverse and opinionated society. I don't think that silencing the reader would stop them in engaging and maybe even caring.
__label__Position	Integrity of political parties and desire - and ability to effect positive change.
__label__Evidence	word filters can be circumvented, for example by replacing one or more letters with a number or asterisk. The filter would not remove the offensive word but it would still be clear to readers what word was being used.
__label__Position	Public services need investment, tax needs to increas
__label__Evidence	You can reduce hate speech in the comment section by flagging certain vocabulary which directly relates to hate speech, which then will automatically block the comment and therefore cannot be posted.
__label__Position	Use moderators to regulate harmful posts
__label__Evidence	"""Townscape ('amenity') and heritage concerns"" (Crispin Edwards) "
__label__Position	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/npr-comments-decision-guardian-readers
__label__Evidence	It is their responsibility though because if someone feels unsafe on their platform due to hate commentary then they lose customers and in some eyes may endorse hate speech by not doing anything to address it or try and filter it.
__label__Position	Strict content moderation
__label__Position	having moderators approve comments
__label__Evidence	People are entitled to an opinion that isn't hateful or intended to harm a person.
__label__Position	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__Evidence	i think you are in the minority here haha, most of the world are moving to the right, look at France, its almost going hard right. in the UK, we've had a right wing gov for 14yrs who havent exactly succeeded - ive not seen any left wing extremism anywhere! 
__label__Evidence	I agrre with this
__label__Evidence	I dont believe in privatisation either!  
__label__Evidence	Being able to keep comments open is not a justification or a refutation of the presence of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Those people can get away with the comment only if they are anonymous. Such nasty comments can block your connection in near future
__label__Evidence	Cost of living because that government has allowed and enabled profiteering by coorporations and private entities e.g. energy sector 
__label__Position	Regulating hate speech in the comment sections is no problem, the problem is with media outlets that are exempted from this regulation and they can delivery any type of content, offensive and non offensive without getting censored
__label__Position	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Use moderators and algorithms to detect hateful language and scramble it.
__label__Evidence	I don't think banning people from commenting would lead them to do something more powerful or extreme.
__label__Evidence	I agree that a change of government is needed, but realistically no other party has any valid reasoning of what exactly they will do to help. All as bad as each other! 
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is interestingly tackled in this article: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/online-stubbornness
__label__Position	Rich nations rigged poor (powerless) nations. By choosing bio-fuel or dams solutions they just sentencing poor nations to extinction
__label__Evidence	We cannot rely to other people to recognize hate
__label__Position	promote good stories  about people doing good and helping society
__label__Position	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are reviewed. Maybe also have an alogorithim that has key words that it seeks and when it finds them flags the comment for review.
__label__Evidence	Totally get why Britain is on board to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels but the infrastructure is not there to support it. I do not think the country should bankrupt itself to try to achieve net-zero, when the majority of people can't afford EVs, or heat pumps. So only rich folk will be able to drive cars?  Can our roads cope with more EVs, which are much much heavier than normal cars? Also at the end of the day, until the likes of China and India buy into climate change and rein in their own industries, tiny little old Britain isn't really making a difference but will be making a lot of people miserable
__label__Position	You are very right Diana. But, the virtual world does have its drawbacks. People can become keyboard warriors behind anonymity
__label__Evidence	I think this is true and there is no need for spiteful comments to be made and ruin someone's day.
__label__Position	i think there are words that could be blocked out when commenting. Swear words, hate words or just unnecessary words.
__label__Evidence	hope they don't fix the ballot and its noticed that more and more people are deciding none of the options are what we want 
__label__Evidence	Tracking details could become intrusive.
__label__Evidence	Leave the ECHR
__label__Position	I think having a filtering system to block certain hateful words could help and moderation of comments/report systems.
__label__Position	I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__Evidence	This may end up filtering out individuals with valid opinions that just feel safer commenting anonymously.
__label__Position	(for real, not a testing topic) For Nice Meeting, we should propose having half an hour for T3.4, briefly showing ORBIS partners 1) our general recommendations for recruitment (and why they are important and useful) 2) specific recommendations for 6 pilots. It can be done in 6 small groups by giving them time to reflect on their approaches and our recommendations. We can do it with or without T3.5. The activity should be interactive and maximise the potential of an in-person meeting. We should go around the six groups and discuss with them closely to reject or revise our recommendations. Feasibility for this year's programme is however of secondary importance, but we should focus on the relevance and usefulness of those suggested practices in engaging marginalised population. 
__label__Evidence	I don't think we should rely on AI or algorithms to safeguard comment sections. Algorithms are only as reliable as the coding, and that is done in total darkness.
__label__Evidence	unfortunately lying now comes naturally to most politicians, there is no integrity anymore, its lets see who can speak the biggest untruths 
__label__Position	NHS, taxes, cost of living and immigration
__label__Evidence	I agree. Articles are written purely so that they can absorb hate comments to boost th e post.
__label__Position	stop the boats coming across the channel
__label__Evidence	more online platform needs a moderator role, too often you see posts on social media that have rampant hate speech going unfiltered and the commenter going unpunished
__label__Position	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments.  People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name.  The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously.  This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments.  Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__Position	There are pros to allowing comments, as referenced by this paper: Allowing easy access to public participation and require minimal technological expertise, the reader comment platform can serve as a digital marketplace of ideas, enabling spontaneous dialogue among readers on critical contemporary issues (Hecht, 2003).
__label__Position	The appalling government of the last 15 years
__label__Evidence	It will be difficult to establish the standards for which you regulate people - other than blocking obvious words
__label__Position	I believe in free but appropriate speech; nothing racist, homphobic etc or hateful.
__label__Position	There are some words that are clearly hate speech i.e. slurs. Filters could ban use of these words, including common alternatives. Whilst I admit that there is some use of groups 'reclaiming' those words, I think in general filters could do a first step, low level job of filtering some hate speech.
__label__Position	I believe some sort of regulation in media will always be necessary to decrease the damage hate speech might cause -- comments space included. We still need to get to the bottom of the issue, though.
__label__Evidence	i think people do need to vent,this is a safe way to do so
__label__Position	Leadership within the OU needs to role model integrity, transparency, collaboration, strategic direction, appropriate challenge to each other, trust and ability to see the bigger picture not just your own unit / area
__label__Position	I agree. One should not upload such comments on a public platform, constructive criticism can be allowed
__label__Evidence	Some dissenting opinions and hate comments can spur conversation and be used as a learning opportunity, but it is important for people who use hate speech to be removed from the platform if it becomes too much.  The people using the hate speech will become more emboldened and continue to use hate speech if  it is allowed to continue.
__label__Position	Cost of Living Crisis
__label__Position	https://www.discoursemagazine.com/ideas/2022/03/08/the-fifth-wave-who-fact-checks-the-fact-checkers/
__label__Position	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__Evidence	that is true there are many ways to reduce hate speech from newspapers
__label__Position	That could be an issue but I also think that doing nothing would be worst for our cultures
__label__Position	Comments could be reviewed by a computer/algorithm to see if they contain hate speech
__label__Evidence	I hope you do.  you can get a candidate who is less bad than the alternative.  Or just vote for the one who is least bad even if they have no hope - it still sends a message.  And at absolute worst, spoil your ballot - it's still a message 
__label__Position	To be able to comment because freedom of speech is only fair.
__label__Evidence	the writer will not feel disheartened
__label__Evidence	Really like the idea that leadership is about uniting colleagues - it's more than half the battle to get the right people in the room.
__label__Position	Anyone else here struggling to make sense of this forum? I can't seem to post any of my responses
__label__Position	Maybe it is time to increase our love for each other and decrease hatred by practicing empathy. Getting to know each other in the real world will always be more constructive for our society than hating in the virtual world.
__label__Position	https://www.e-marketingassociates.com/blog/the-importance-of-monitoring-social-media-comments - This stresses the importance of monitoring comments as it has both positives for us and positives for these newspaper companies. Not only does hate crime harm individuals but it can harm the business who allow hate crime to be associated with their platform. It is necessary and okay for people to have opinions however morally we should draw a line and know where we stand on right and wrong
__label__Position	I want to see more levelling up and it be done fairly - not just money sent to areas that have an MP from a  particular party.
__label__Evidence	100% Rishi claiming we need to pay more taxes to pay for help during Covid when most of it was handed out to people in dodgy loans that should be clawed back! Not taken from people actually trying to make an honest living! 
__label__Position	potholes and big Oil & gas corporations being taxed huge profits to tackle their green house gases 
__label__Evidence	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.
__label__Evidence	but some newspapers will take advantage of readers
__label__Position	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.
__label__Evidence	Would support accountability instead of a comment submitter operating in the mystery and shroud of being anonymous.
__label__Evidence	I also agree with both of your points. Its been making who to vote for really difficult for me. As i don't trust any of the parties will fulfil what we need.
__label__Evidence	The trouble with the online newspapers/media is they already show bias to certain stories depending on where you read. Comment sections can be useful for discussion but it's a shame that not all people use them in the best way.
__label__Position	I feel the Labour party has the most comprehensive plan regarding environmental protection, education and taxes
__label__Position	There will always be readers who make appalling comments that are unsubstantiated and incite hate
__label__Evidence	Not an issue that impacts on my life
__label__Position	Ability to answer a question honestly (think we're at about 0% success with that one)
__label__Evidence	The panel would be biased in some way no matter how much the newspaper tries to remove bias.
__label__Position	Monitor comments made
__label__Position	If you believe that its man made and that man caused it, then its possible and likely that man can fix it like anything else. I guess part of the solution is figuring out a way thats not going to bankrupt us and is reasonable.
__label__Position	Comments can be screened for hateful words or phrases via a list checked by appropriate charities or organisations, so as not to restrict free speech but reducing hate speech substantially
__label__Evidence	People will add their opinions anyway, whether they are necessary or not
__label__Evidence	It could be damaging for allinvo
__label__Position	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/073953299701800301?journalCode=nrja
__label__Position	Education and moderation is key but it will never be enough to eliminate hate speech. People are entitled to speak their opinions and should be able to do so. Moderation could also be undertaken by the readers themselves, flagging any alarming posts for moderators to check. Sadly there will always be a way online these days to preach hate and bullying and it is very difficult to counteract. Newspapers need to take responsibility for the article’s that they publish and be aware of how the general public may react.
__label__Position	Anna Beckett from Symmetrys looks at the problem from a sustainability point of view rather than a building and heritage perspective. The first thing we need to do is use the building we already have and adapt them to the modern age. Escape routes that are compatible with heritage building needs is an issue to tackle for instance.
__label__Evidence	I agree that restricting comments would limit hate speech
__label__Evidence	totally agree and I think that this is the biggest issue for most people, the government has only cared about themselves and not anyone else
__label__Position	A key factor that could make filtering unfair is the fact that is done merely by automatic detection tools without human vetting or control.
__label__Evidence	This seems like agreat idea.
__label__Evidence	Doesn't seem to be anyone in either party.
__label__Evidence	This and Trans rights were a hugely emotive issue in Scotland not that long ago but has barely been mentioned in this election campaign.
__label__Position	do you agree that a government needs to totally reform the NHS rather than just throw more money into an ever larger black hole?
__label__Position	Who will make the better prime minister?
__label__Evidence	It has been suggested that hiding comments rather than removing them is the best way forward. Commenters don't like their posts to be deleted, understandably, and often feel censored which can cause them to lash out with further offensive comments. By hiding a comment, the original poster can still see it and may not realise that it has been hidden from others which minimises upset caused to others whilst preserving the original poster's involvement. https://blog.brandbastion.com/deleting-comments-can-trigger-backlash
__label__Position	I agree, not only to reduce hate speech but also to limit false freedom in participation
__label__Position	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become. Resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech
__label__Position	There needs to be far more substantial clear cut planning, as so many ideas never come to fruition in this country. Successive governments sway one way, then the other, and never ever properly fix long term issues
__label__Position	No, it's not a fair choice.  But we have to admit that there are also some shortcomings of current design of comment space, since hate sometimes reproduce hate, rather than solving problems. I would say BCAUSE is better designed than the simple comment space.
__label__Position	A good starting point would be to ensure comments aren't anonymous, so that people think more carefully about what they write.
__label__Evidence	I do agree that comments shouldn't be closed.
__label__Position	By monitoring comments for hate speech and removing those comments rather than the whole section
__label__Evidence	AI is a great option that would reduce the need for manpower and increase the efficiency and speed in which hate speech is addressed.
__label__Position	The NHS, housing, the cost of living crisis, and climate change
__label__Evidence	It is an easy programming process to do so.
__label__Position	the economy, the NHS
__label__Position	i feel it definitely stifles peopls opinions.  Everyone should be given the freedom to state their stance on a particular opinion of theirs. This is called censoring.
__label__Position	Like one other commenter said, there's multiple ways of spreading hate speech other than newspapers websites, such as social media. I think every little bit helps when combating hate speech though, so moderating the comments section would make a diffference.
__label__Evidence	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them
__label__Position	I think that generally speaking, climate change can be corrected for the future. But we need big corporations to be on board, and the federal government to start mandating it. 
__label__Evidence	I don't necessarily disagree, but solutions would include funding the planning system better and requiring LPAs to have conservation advice, both of which would aid early engagement and head off the development of proposals that are likely to be refused. Substantial energy efficiency improvements can be made for most buildings, including listed ones, without planning permission or listed building consent. Concentrate on quick wins.
__label__Position	preferences for extreme ethical opinions 
__label__Position	SOme key issues for me have been what is happening with the NHS,  housing (including mortages) and tax rates
__label__Position	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__Position	Cost of living, underfunding NHS and Education.
__label__Position	"Back in 2014 the Guardian wrote an article about this: https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation They said people feel being able to say what they want is their right, but they can be very harmful. They said: ""In the absence of strict moderation, we’d be much better off without them."" I do agree with this - we definitely can't have comments sections left with no moderation at all."
__label__Evidence	what specifically about immigration
__label__Position	In this election, I am interested in parties stance on crime, illegal drugs, theft etc, as well as the economy, housing, and immigration too. 
__label__Position	Yes it can avoid a lot of arguments and harrasments  
__label__Evidence	Also agree that one-income households should be able to live a comfortable life for their children. There are not enough nursery places for all children so some will inevitably have to be cared for at home anyway, and parents who make that choice for whatever reason should be supported in doing so.
__label__Position	the websites should have built in AI that detects certain words or strings of words that may be deemed as hate speech and censor them
__label__Position	Its normal to ne worked out by certain news. Emotions are not the same some of us we get worked out easier.
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree completely about immigration. It should be monitored a lot lot more and stricter measures brought in place to decrease it.
__label__Evidence	There should be a warning to ban the account of someone who uses hate words in the comment section.
__label__Evidence	I disagree. In an Institute for Government webinar yesterday (24/10 https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/events/what-works-government-evidence-policy) the point was made that the public are not educated to challenge what they read in the media. It is therefore naive to assume that people would start to search around things they read in the news because 1) we are not taught how to do this and 2) there is no motive for people to begin to do this. Based on the amount of conspiracy documentaries on Netflix and YouTube it is possible that people would indeed search around what they read but for negative/conspiracy motives rather than as ground truthing.
__label__Evidence	how does devolving more powers to Metro Mayors solve economical problems the United Kindom is facing?
__label__Evidence	It is possible to express opinions without being aggressive, but that doesn't mean people will do so. Online arguments often get very heated and can quickly devolve into hate and personal attacks- this should not be tolerated in forums meant for discussion of news
__label__Evidence	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.
__label__Evidence	"""Tools for homeowners, assessors, planners etc - STBA and others"" (Crispin Edwards)"
__label__Evidence	It's important to allow people to provide their own commentary
__label__Position	I'm not sure I agree with the characterisation by others here of removing comment sections on newspapers being censorship or removal of free speech. People are still able to express their opinions on the news without those opinions being actively published by the newspaper via the comment section. They can simply share on their own social media channels for example, and express their opinions there. I think if newspapers do not have the resources to moderate comment sections, this is a fair choice to make. However overall I think that larger newspapers who can sustain a moderation team have been successful in filtering out hate speech while still giving readers the opportunity to discuss and comment.
__label__Evidence	Gathering data in a specific area of online discussion like newspaper comment sections would probably reveal a lot about how online discourse turns to hate speech and how to tackle it as a problem. Maybe this task could be given to an independent or charitable institution, with the newspapers' cooperation?
__label__Evidence	Spam calls
__label__Position	the comments must just be filtered
__label__Position	by actively reviewing the comments and restricting hate-related language
__label__Position	Often, haters pick on people whom they perceive as being different from themselves. Being the focus of negative and critical comments can be upsetting and trigger feelings of anger, hurt, and confusion, and cause the person being criticized to question their self-worth and behavior. If the negative comments are posted online, it can also make someone afraid to use their social media accounts or feel ashamed of what is happening there.
__label__Evidence	Good. As long as it wasn't reported and the opinion was well written.
__label__Evidence	the same study showed the conservatives would have to put taxes up more
__label__Evidence	I don't think this is the main thing we should be concerned about. it is very important but if we don't sort out the state of the economy no one will be able to afford to live 
__label__Evidence	none of them seem to be honest  
__label__Evidence	I believe there are no pros to allowing hate speech
__label__Position	I've been asked to summarise my position after carefully considering everyone elses viewpoints but most of the positions I've read are opinions on whether it should be done rather than how so I'm not sure how I'm supposed to address this.
__label__Evidence	governments and corporations wont want to spend the money to put in the research for this
__label__Evidence	which area of the criminal justice system would you like to see a change in? 
__label__Evidence	May be difficult to continuously update adn monitor
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice. 
__label__Position	I believe that having free speech is totally fine but comments that are offensive, hate speech or discriminatory in any way should be removed. The comment section should be monitored.
__label__Evidence	Im thinking, time for a change. can it really get any worse
__label__Evidence	I agree that requiring ID,  and utilising AI should greatly reduce hate speech
__label__Position	Remove the comment section on the websites, the news are meant to be read and nothing can be changed on the statements given on the news.
__label__Evidence	I agree with Ian.
__label__Evidence	To add to my previous comment about having clear and established rules I refer to https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-1388145/House-Rules.html The daily mail is well known for having a very open and sometimes contentious comment section. By having clear rules and removing posts that break rules and not based on opinion or thought. You can allow people to say controversial things as long as they stay within some boundaries
__label__Evidence	"""Not a museum piece but active heritage to which we continue to add"" (Steven Bee)"
__label__Position	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__Evidence	I can't see how this would work, it would still happen regardless of the size of the comments senction
__label__Position	having a way of screening and removing those comments will help.
__label__Position	We should not hide opinions but a general respect should be lined out in rules of comments, where no hate speech or prejudice should be allowed. People should still be given a voice to speak on topics with respect to every other human being and this should be monitored by the platform from preventing any prejudice that could be commented. I ultimately think there should still be a comment section for all people, but within a controlled environment on the platform.
__label__Evidence	Yes, this is a very crucial point. Something which is hate speech for a particular ideology might not be so for others.
__label__Evidence	"""Explaining why alternative approachhes people are quite willing to listen to what you have to say"" (Crispin Edwards)"
__label__Evidence	Agree - all schools need to make pupils aware of views and faiths that might be different from their own. Greater awareness generates better understanding of others and harmony.
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by having it moderated
__label__Position	This is a good article in how to combat hate speech comments: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Position	I can't see anyone else's comments to respond to them either.
__label__Evidence	"The thing is if people filter these comments, they may not work as accurate as AI. For example, they may use their own judgements to decide if something is appropriate. If we use AI, we can simply add new filters, like words or phrases, AI will filter all comments in the way we ""teach"" it."
__label__Position	following instincts
__label__Evidence	Agree in every sense, ticket prices, reliability etc. 
__label__Evidence	Only allowing paying users might result in the most of the users in a comment section having the same view. For example, many young people do not use newspaper websites. Each comment section might not be diverse at all in type of users or the opinions being shared. Is an echo chamber better, equal to, or worse than a few hate comments?
__label__Position	I would rather be part of the EU
__label__Position	Ah there are a few for whom immigration is an issue. Farage wants to stop it but he'll also reduce waiting lists by depotring half the NHS staff
__label__Position	The lies during covid and constant rule breaking without all the tores being held accountable 
__label__Evidence	This goes beyond just technical issues, it is also a matter of civilization for the general public to show it cares about fellow citizens with disabilities.
__label__Position	by limiting the number of characters that can be used in the comments and flagging for words or phrases
__label__Position	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments, banning repeating offenders and requiring a phone number to create a account.
__label__Evidence	I agree,the should be someone who's hired to check comment and to block.Also those who bully people shoul not be allowed on the site
__label__Position	The economy, health and immigration
__label__Position	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Position	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__Position	affordable housing
__label__Evidence	I think that freedom of speech must be protected in any case, and there may be no doubt about censorship or bias relating to the political orientation of the journalistic house in question 
__label__Evidence	People will always find other alternative ways  to express express themselves. Removing the comments section is not the solution but it would help reduce cyber bullying and make the internet a safer space for people.
__label__Position	I think it is much easier to moderate for explicit rather than insidious harm in comment. Perhaps there is not a perfect solution here but moderating would help to remove at least some of the the most obvious hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree, people should have the newspaper identify hate speech, but also the newspaper needs to actually evaluate the reported comments
__label__Evidence	Guidelines could be very useful to set up rules for what is and isn't allowed on the website. Then, everyone has a clear understanding of the moderator's goals and reasonings.
__label__Evidence	Possible infringment on data
__label__Evidence	But also... an open comment section provides these individuals with a platform and instead of the desired open communication to educate people, it can be that more people become radicalised.
__label__Evidence	Training AI to do that would be a great way to prevent this phenomen
__label__Evidence	It may be a high-cost approach, but worthwhile for our modern society to prioritise for the good of a healthy, functioning nation.
__label__Position	As well as having a screening process, I think there shouldn't be an option to anonymise someones comment. People are less inclined to troll if they have their name and face attached to a profile.
__label__Position	There should set rules on what users can comment
__label__Position	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__Evidence	"""Not a museum piece but active heritage to which we continue to add"" (Steven Bee) "
__label__Position	I think all comments must be moderated in order to reduce hate speech but at the same time it is fair for readers to give their feedback.
__label__Position	our relationship with the EU
__label__Evidence	I agree. The BBC has previously been reprimanded for only having one side of the climate change debate speak (denier vs scientist). The public should receive multiple points of view in a way that is balanced and evidence-based.
__label__Position	turning off comments actually lowered the amount of time readers spent on the site https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__Position	As with some of the other comments, perhaps if hate speech really is a concern that removing the option to be able to so could be the best option, but I still think that this can be moderated
__label__Position	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__Evidence	I agree. Considering much of this hate speech comes from bots it is impossible to keep up with it. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221104749
__label__Evidence	Shame that voting for the other parties is essentially pointless 
__label__Evidence	While I agree that hate speech is such, I feel like getting rid of the comment section would really go backwards and do more harm than good.
__label__Position	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__Position	"For some people, ""Man made climate change"" begs the question. While I might not be one of them, I'll say assuming climate change is indeed man made, all we can do is reduce our greenhouse gas generation. This will require the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to be prioritized more than it currently is."
__label__Position	I think the comments should be monitored to avoid hate speech
__label__Position	i still think information should be screened before it should post it. hate speech and its effects are not worth the risk, but people should be allowed free speech so it would be unfair to remove comment sections completely
__label__Position	No. VR 4.46 repeats the same events that took place with Mayavi as noted in VR 4.9. 
__label__Position	"I think it's a bit of a lost cause. People will put hate speech in. The only way to stop it, I think is to not allow comments to be made. Technically, that's what happens with print versions of newspapers. We just read the article. Anyone who wants to express an opinion can write a letter to the editor. (Who would screen out hate stuff!). But, we live in an online world. So people expect to be able to have their say. And people probably wouldn't subscribe if they can't interact on an online service. Anyway, I do think people having verified accounts might help. Need to stop the ""anonymous"" profiles - the coward's castle types."
__label__Position	NHS, Immigration, Economy 
__label__Evidence	That's a good speech! Unfortunately, in the real world, that doesn't work. For the most part, people that comments on newspapers websites are adults (or late teens) and already got an education. And yes, for the most part, it'll be enough, they have good values and know how to share ideas without hate. But for some, it's not the case...
__label__Evidence	AI algorithms are frequently biased. There's still a long way to go before reliable AI algorithms are developed. Until then, using AI algorithms alone to moderate the comment sections of newspapers will likely lead to harmless comments removed, and, on the other hand, harmful comments published. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/04/the-role-of-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/?sh=3bf5308b579d
__label__Position	I will vote Labour as we need a change
__label__Position	I worked in education for over 20 years so that is always a major issue for me. Education is devolved in Scotland so my views would reflect that. Aside from this, I'm a couple of years away from getting the state pension. While I welcome the triple lock, I hate that so many more pensioners are being dragged into payong taxes. Lastly, my daughter still lives with us but is saving hard for a deposit so that's important for me too.
__label__Evidence	I agree with the idea that anonymity on the Internet often has the consequence to make it easier for people to harass / be horrible to each others.
__label__Position	NHS, Brexit, Pensions
__label__Position	making sure to vote to give conservatives a chance
__label__Evidence	I don't think most people would take the time to educate each other about hate speech, and I assume there will be stubborn people that are stuck in their ways and will continue to comment their hateful opinions.
__label__Position	more cheese taxes
__label__Position	Require all comments to go through a censor first. can limit hate speech. https://www.netreputation.com/internet-censorship-pros-cons/
__label__Evidence	wait times
__label__Evidence	removing the comment space completely would allow people to focus solely on the content of the news and not allow people to provide their comments, this might give people the chance to be completely objective and just focus on what is in front of them instead of them using the comment space as a place to vent their frustrations.
__label__Position	Attitude towards the economy, net zero and taxation
__label__Evidence	Agreed, more understanding and education are always good for society. Moderation functions as a good intermediary for discussion.
__label__Evidence	Celebrities are a massive victim of hate speech allowing people the freedom of commenting what they want is harmful. A lot of the time articles will use these comments in other articles to back up negative opinions about others
__label__Evidence	without online verified profiles being mandatory i think this could be difficult to put into practise
__label__Position	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__Position	It's alarming that some people do not understand the dangers that are presented by accepthing hate speech.
__label__Position	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.
__label__Evidence	Also links to Historic Englands Position Statements and Overviews on Climate Change here: https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/features/climate-change/
__label__Position	In this same article, there is a section further down using reddit as an example. A particular subreddit inroducted strict rules for their comment section, and with over 30 moderators, people follow them and create a good environment. This shows that it is possible to moderate the comments and have a good, healthy comment section https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	Educate people that hate speech can lower a person's self esteem
__label__Position	"""There is a disparity between planning policies and decarbonisation agenda at local authority level"" (Paul Norman)"
__label__Evidence	I understand why people dont bother, it can seem pointless to people because little seems to change. 
__label__Evidence	I agree. The NHS needs a major overhaul I think. Funding should go to people on the frontline, not just  the higher ups.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is a form of verbal assault and should not be tolerated or encouraged.
__label__Position	To be honest, I am torn, I think that good newspapers (good referring to the quality of their investigating and reporting) should not need a comment section. They should report the facts and as such, comments I feel are not needed, the goal is to provide information and comments are mostly opinions. What is the goal of the comments?
__label__Evidence	It is great to ban them but they would create different profiles again to put out their comments. One good side of this idea is that they would consistently have to do extra work in creating new profiles to put out their hate speeches, and hopefully,  one day they would be tired and give up.
__label__Evidence	If a media regulate how people respond to their news, they can aid the fight against hate speech.
__label__Position	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__Evidence	I totally agree!
__label__Evidence	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments for future moderated review :-)
__label__Evidence	that isn't bad, but there are some who can run circles around others with their linguistic skills
__label__Position	I may have to walk back on my idea about trigger warnings. This study showed that trigger warnings can cause more harm than good in some cases 5f3d455fc5a9c209cb8b94b4.
__label__Position	I agree with other posters that moderation is the answer. There should be dedicated resource within newspapers that look at comments being made, and removing those that breach guidelines. Guidelines should be publicly accessible. Comment should be closed after a pre-defined period of time to reduce burden on moderators.
__label__Evidence	Why do you think there is a rising tolerance of crime? 
__label__Position	"A position that surprised me is one that says that ""... there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers"". Newspapers are run by humans and humans can make mistakes. Also, engagement on current affairs is very helpful should the newspaper article be written in a manner that may be confusing to some people. I think educating people on the devastating impacts of hate speech should be prioritized. Posts with hate speech should be removed and the user who posted it should be educated on why their comment contains hate speech. Education on how to be a socially connected population should also be prioritized. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech"
__label__Evidence	if No more trolls, political copy-pastes, or general rudeness and anger are in comments i think both sides of arguement/opinion can be heard.
__label__Evidence	Much as I agree that's probably ideal as far as not requiring constant monitoring of the sort that's only really feasible for a relatively small amount of newer articles, the kind of technology for properly filtering such things isn't quite there yet, beyond simply checking for specific language. ...and it's worth noting, even if it was, whoever writes the algorithm also decides what is worthy of being removed. Being able to cull commentary automatically this way is potentially even more damaging if your concern is freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Is this starting to get really slow for anyone else?
__label__Position	we shouldn't be worried about ai because it creates jobs regardless if a lot of people lose their jobs
__label__Position	Economy, housing and immigration
__label__Evidence	You have to constantly ban people when they create new accounts
__label__Position	We need to update our conceptual frameworks and thinking patterns about food systems
__label__Position	we can reduce the hate speech by keeping control on what people can say and sometimes you can automatically ban certain words being used
__label__Position	Unless the comments encourages acts of crime on people and animals then it's not hate speech, it's you are a moderator and you censor certain comments because hew they make you feel then you are unfit for the job.
__label__Evidence	Technology can help in sharing the importance to many people in less time
__label__Evidence	The NHS needs legal immigration, which they rely on for lots of the jobs. 
__label__Evidence	I disagree. Would you like to read a newspaper filled with hate speech just because they are not in charge of identifying what is hate speech or not?
__label__Evidence	"""Many barriers trying to do so"" (Anna Beckett)"
__label__Position	Simplify EU websites and communication to make them more accessible
__label__Position	Best would be to use filters for keywords and have a functional helpdesk, team of mods,... If the mods ARE effective and the climate between the users is friendly, there is a high chance, that not many trolls/toxic comments will come up at a later time.
__label__Position	I believer that it is important to allow comments to encourage dialogue and varied opinions.  Perhaps stipulating the rules of what behaviour is accepted in the comments section would assist in reducing the level of hate speech, although there are trolls who feed off doing so.  The following article quotes:  Dr Philips’ colleague, College of Charleston assistant professor of communication Ryan Milner, studies participatory media and public conversation. He tells me something similar when I ask him if comment sections should be the exception or rule of websites. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation I think it could be a mistake to make them ‘the rule’ and then just leave them there unattended. I think if you want a comment section – and I believe in the power of voice to public engagement, mounting evidence to the contrary – then it has to [be] alongside a commitment to curating civil engagement. This means technological, editorial, and social steps to make them the agora you want them to be.
__label__Evidence	It is the best solution
__label__Position	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__Position	The solution lies in creating some sort of moderation on the comment sections and try to make people accountable for what they write in the comment section. There should be also a process to assure that there are no fake profiles and that the information given in the profiles it's true. Educating people on how to use comment section and creating accountability for their comments will help prevent hate speech in a less drastic way.
__label__Evidence	Hey! This looks like slippery slope type of thinking
__label__Position	I am not arguing or debating. There is no point in that.
__label__Position	A system should be implemented in which hate speech can be detected. This can be done through filtering common hat speech phrases or words used. Furthermore, an option should be provided where readers can report hate speech and those who are responsible for the comment must take responsibility. Responsibility can range from being charged a fine, removing comments, or providing bans for a period of time and preventing them from commenting.
__label__Evidence	I believe you are referencing an AI, but that would require certain technology and datasets for it to understand what to look for. You can also argue that hateful words can be used in a certain context to argue a point, rather than as a directly hateful comment.
__label__Evidence	Some people may use AI responsibly
__label__Position	hate speech moderation can also be difficult and will require intelligent human response rather than relying solely on the use of AI https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Evidence	Where is the money going to come from?  It is a mess!
__label__Position	People seem slit 50/50 down the middle one half saying newspapers should not have comments sections it should be one sided and the other half saying get the personal details of the commenters incase they do commit hate speech and I agree with the latte still giving people free speech but monitoring it
__label__Position	Websites should invest in software to remove hate speech, this would allow for healthy debate without racist or descrimination.
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech in both newspapers and comments by educating on the origins and pains behind comments and by filtering certain words

__label__Position	2
__label__Evidence	Any expression that freely and openly gives a clear point that will not offend or insult anyone is not hate speech
__label__Position	I'm not against comments per se. I think this The New York Times article raises a few good points about media bias and public engagement. Perhaps more accountability might hep reduce hate speech in the comments. So many people hide behind their anonymity online and express divisive ideas just to troll and provoke - if they had to post under their real names or with links to their social media accounts, they might think twice before posting hateful opinions. https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/04/18/have-comment-sections-on-news-media-websites-failed/despite-flaws-comments-are-good-for-public-discourse

__label__Position	NHS needs looking at. Use experts and not think-tanks and bad management.
__label__Position	control people coming into the country, law and order, on the spot stop and search, income tax benfits
__label__Evidence	Absolutely! With the current developments in technology we have enough tools to reduce hate speech without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	Having certain words being banned or marked as inappropriate might help reduce hate speech. Systems that moderate what is being said and shared and the option to report hate speech might be helpful.
__label__Position	Whether the claims they make are truthful
__label__Position	another useful method that other platform use is to have a group of moderators that will check for such comments and block the accounts responsible for the hate speech
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others. 
__label__Position	We are unfortunately in an age, where the politicians care far more about themselves, sound bite politics, rather than getting stuck into fixing real problems.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers operate under their own distinct ownership and can thus set their own policies. Stores have their own methods of queuing for product, concert venues have their own methods of admitting attendees. Sites have no obligation to allow unsupervised public discourse.
__label__Position	I believe there should be a bot that automatically sorts through comments, to eliminate the ones that are not appropriate, there is no need to eliminate the chat feature.
__label__Position	websites should also take responsibility and liability for the comments on their sites
__label__Evidence	Too many managers and too many highly paid diversity jobs, Thse should be scrapped and money put towards more front line staff
__label__Evidence	Yes it is best to focus on your own life and the people around you. Politics on tv is just theatre
__label__Position	Check this link: https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons that shows how widespread the problem of hate speech is, and how much hate speech online leads to violence in the real world. We ought to watch what we say on the internet because some people are gullible enough to put into action what people suggest should be done to mitigate certain subjective problems.
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?
__label__Position	Giving you views should be done in a nonoffensive and informative way. Using hate speech should be curtailed and all who do prosecuted. To allow this to happen post must be moderated and traceable. Signing onto a service will pay for this and add traceability.
__label__Position	Cost of living, environment, immigration rhetoric, education
__label__Position	There could also be a disclaimer added before one can see other comments which encourage readers to fact-check and be mindful of what they're reading, while also having moderators.

__label__Position	Giving people the opportunity to provide their comments in a mediated and balanced way would enable free speech and allow the public to be more informed. Comments that are mediated or filtered by an algorithm would reduce hate speech and limit an echo chamber.
__label__Position	I think before the comment being posted, the moderator should read first are they contain hate speech or not, if they contained hate speech they should give it mark/flag.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is not just someone's opinion. It affects people's lives with real consequences, resulting with cases such as severe depression and suicide. https://www.journalofcommunication.ro/index.php/journalofcommunication/article/view/322/307
__label__Evidence	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation. United States. Social media platforms have broad latitude [PDF], each establishing its own standards for content and methods of enforcement. Their broad discretion stems from the Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law exempts tech platforms from liability for actionable speech by their users. Magazines and television networks, for example, can be sued for publishing defamatory information they know to be false; social media platforms cannot be found similarly liable for content they host.

__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__Evidence	A perceived reputable source, but can have political leanings and opinions.
__label__Evidence	The idea of using AI algorithms to combat hate speech is an attractive one. However, using experience of Facebook, it's clear that AI systems are still not advanced enough to undertake this task without human oversight. Facebook often censors posts or comments unfairly because its AI algorithms doesn't understand the context. In short, I don't believe we can get away without using humans to check the flagged comments at least.

__label__Evidence	after 14 years of failing?
__label__Position	by having a moderator to manage the comments and a reporting system for people to use for any comments that contain for example hate speech. many social media groups now very effectively run these things and have spaces for all to discuss things in a respectful way. this works because there is a system to block troll commentators though and so a sign up system that allows moderators to monitor comment content would be necessary
__label__Position	hate speech can be harmful to the the person reading them as such those who comment using hate speech should be punished, the should be laws and regulations which prevent people from posting hateful content
__label__Position	We live in a word where negative comments and hate speech are bound to arise but it is, and should, the newspapers to try to regulate that with some type of code that omits bad language and trigger words. The space for readers comments is important in stimulating conversations about pressing matters, it could also help in collaboratively finding solutions to these matters too.
__label__Position	Have a set of criteria for what counts as 'hate speech', and place the onus upon individual publishers to crack down on eliminating this speech
__label__Evidence	The reason why I disagree is because removing the comment sections unable readers from expressing their view and opinions on certain topics covered in the newspaper.
__label__Position	appreciate people have different views
__label__Position	People will always have something to say, either good or bad. The newspapers website should have credible sources from where they get their information from and also publish well articulated sentences to avoid unnecessary hate comments.
__label__Evidence	Agree with this 100% - the issue is that neither of the parties have string enough manifestos and quite frankly I'm not sure how much I trust someone who has had rather priviledged life to understand low earners - myself I am only on minimum wage and dont see this improving anytime soon 
__label__Evidence	It is a good idea to not completely  remove comment sections as that discourages user interaction

__label__Evidence	I actually agree. Just have the news present a perspective. Readers can agree or disagree on their own.
__label__Evidence	Moderators will allow for fair reviiews
__label__Position	Abolishing the comment section is not the way forward. I think asking commenters for their personal details would also be a breach of the GDPR and may complicate matters for the newspaper. I think there should be some sort of screening that flags up problematic comments.
__label__Evidence	Britain is already a densely populated country. We do need some immigration, for example nurses, but if people don't have skills the country needs then we shouldn't allow them in.
__label__Position	Who I believe canturn things around and make England better
__label__Evidence	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.

__label__Position	The title of the discussion (increasing knowledge of all by all) is not related to its content (understanding the effects of climate change on historic buildings). therefore, there is disappointment and little engagement.

__label__Position	the small boats smuggling migrants
__label__Evidence	It is important to review your comment before posting it, online there is more chance of being misinterpreted so carefully choosing your words can help to minimise this.
__label__Evidence	Agree, think of CO2 emissions saved because of less caddle
__label__Evidence	I really think this could work as technology has come so far and it's out there and available to be used.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	I agree with this. With that being said, we as consumers need to demand more from the same organizations. We need to go to all levels of government and demand that these same organizations give us alternatives in the form of electric and hydro cars while also proving that we are ready to purchase them to give these same organizations incentive to play along.
__label__Evidence	agree and it's worse for us here in Northern Ireland 
__label__Evidence	This is the main problem that we are facing in the climate issue because some peoples are not considering the climate change problem. So the environment awareness is less. We need to consider the climate change.
__label__Evidence	Allows people to express their views.
__label__Position	no democratic society can thrive by wholly suppressing the voices of those who are involved in the decision making processes of the government. I firmly stand behind the argument that the comment space should remain but I also believe that these news houses and government, need to be more proactive in educating people about important and pressing topics, rather than preventing them from doing so completely. In as much as words/opinions can be harmful, they can also be helpful .https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech . the attached article supports this notion. I also say that the best deterrence method is sanctions. people tend to rethink/reconsider their decisions when they evaluate what the outcome/punishment could potentially be. whole purposes of newspaper is educate and inform, that in itself requires dialogue. when this is eliminated you run the risk of giving one outlet the benefit of writing what ever they choose without the possibility of them being checked.
__label__Position	Create an obligation for companies to have thorough moderation software/employees that review comments before they are available for the public to see. This retains freedom of speech but ensures that anyone posting anything morally or legally reprehensible is prevented from doing so.
__label__Evidence	Definitely. The current system is a joke and the Easyjet flights to Rwanda will actually land just outside Bournemouth
__label__Position	Could the comments be 'policed' by either an algorithm or reviewers looking for some key words that are frequently used by people who leave hate speech
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__Evidence	This is very sensible.
__label__Evidence	Some of these issues are more pressing than others 
__label__Evidence	peoples' opinion on the internet tend to be more extreme in general due to anonymity. I doubt not letting them comment will make it any worse
__label__Position	Hate speech online absolutely must be eliminated and we should not encourage it within online platforms. Hate speech can and does lead to violence which is more severe than 'being horrible online'. https://www.coe.int/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is very different to valid criticism.

__label__Evidence	I believe that healthcare is a major issue at the moment that needs to be changed
__label__Evidence	Yes to the sex based rights - I can never vote for a party whose leader does not appear to know what a woman is
__label__Position	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__Evidence	well that would affect the credibility of the newspaper and reputation so yes it is a big responsibility to maintain spaces civilised
__label__Evidence	The content is then controlled by the moderators. How do we ensure that a comment they simply disagree with but still adds to the discussion is let through?
__label__Evidence	People may stop reading news sites if they don't feel able to interact with them as they have been able to previously. This could lead to people seeking their news info all the more from highly unregulated/skewed sources, such as social feeds.
__label__Evidence	they need to make it easier for a young person to buy a house

__label__Evidence	"""More focus on place and sustainability, not just buildings"" (Crispin Edwards)"
__label__Position	A study by the Israel democracy Institute (https://www.idi.org.il/media/13570/recommendations-for-reducing-online-hate-speech.pdf) suggests that social media companies should be required to assist with such matter as they are a large platform for hate speech. Working with mainstream media (newspapers) may assist with globally reducing the hate rhetoric
__label__Position	It is important to understand what hate speech actually is. Attached is an example of what may be construed as hate speech, but it is only through a shared understanding of what hate speech is that it can start to be tackled. Effective moderation to agreed guidelines is the key.
__label__Position	I agree that you have to assess moderation carefully, as not to ruin democracy
__label__Evidence	I totally agree we have freedom of expression
__label__Position	Censor out words
__label__Evidence	"The problem is some form of censorship would be required for writers if the definition of ""hate speech"" isn't universally agreed. Perhaps a trigger warning for readers of a sensitive disposition could be given at the start of an article. Different countries have different laws or understandings of hate speech. Will comments from different countries have to be blocked?"
__label__Position	Maybe we shouldn't. If filtering changes people's honest opinions then it isn't a good thing. Moderating leaves it open to deleting what someone simply doesn't agree with.
__label__Position	After having read other comments it is clear that an AI would also allow for faster moderation and removal of hate speech faster. Additionally, an AI would not be as bias as an individual may be, who would have their own ideas about what hate speech is and can be.
__label__Position	I would like zero hour contracts abolished. Sadly, it will not happen.
__label__Evidence	They are doing an amazing service, the NHS is one thing to be proud of. But there are many inefficiencies  that could be improved.
__label__Position	There should be a system in place that flags negative words associated with hate speech and doesn't allow the comment to be posted and puts the person and comment under review.
__label__Position	I personnally think hate speech shouldnt even be discussed being a fact of the topic or not. Reason being every has easy access on newspapers you wouldnt want teenagers to be reading hate speech o newspapapers.
__label__Evidence	Yes! Absolutely correct! 
__label__Evidence	I think if saying something out loud in a public place would get you arrested, you should not be allowed to type it online.
__label__Evidence	In addition to using algorithms, technology can be used to eliminate comments that involve hate speech for reader inclusivity. I definitely agree to this. Everyone has a freedom of speech, but it should infringe the rights of others too.
__label__Evidence	That was COP25, I believe in this discussion we are trying to focus on COP26
__label__Evidence	Absolutely agree with this - so many people affected by it, we need prevention and treatment
__label__Evidence	It is scary how much a weekly food shop has become for a family of 4
__label__Evidence	I think it is a good idea to be able to flag the comment so moderators can review it
__label__Position	There are technological, economic and political considerations that we must make if we are to reverse a trend that might otherwise threaten our very existence.
__label__Position	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__Position	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__Position	hate speech is everywhere online, we can never run away from it but there have to be away to deal with hate speech without removing the comment space
__label__Evidence	readers should be able to have their say
__label__Position	Hate speech can be avoided and combatted on online platforms. This could be through the use of Artificial Intelligence, explaining why speech is hateful and keeping people informed so that they know when speech is hateful. This article goes into further detail. https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/04/09/how-should-social-media-platforms-combat-misinformation-and-hate-speech/
__label__Position	The creation of a safe space within the comments section run by moderators around the clock with the assistance of software that roots out keywords that could be hate speech and a swift report and block system to deny access to people violating the rules
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	hate speech is still free speech tho
__label__Position	cost of living crisis 
__label__Position	There is a need for better regulation and control of social media and AI
__label__Position	wanting a stronger economy
__label__Evidence	people naturally get angry so its difficult to reduce hate speech without any group being offended to some distinction
__label__Position	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.
