__label__Evidence	What is edible, should be given to humans. What humans cannot eat, should be available for animals. What both cannot use, should go to biogas plants. The solid waste from biogas plants can be transformed into excellent compost. Runoff from biogas plants can be treated & provide H2. And the heat from biogas plants can provide heating or other forms of energy.
__label__Evidence	Changes in management practices, and above all the integration of trees in arable and pastoral lands, are key, and could turn agriculture from a net emitter to a net absorber of greenhouse gases.
__label__Position	We should fight urbanization
__label__Evidence	Fish are sentient and failure to afford them the same legal protections that we provide other animals is a gross moral and legal oversight.
__label__Evidence	Extremely important thing for an informed decision of the citizens e.g. in the supermarket.
__label__Evidence	In order to be able to fight cross-border crime, Europol should have the same jurisdiction as the FBI in the US. It should focus on domestic EU cross-border crime fighting. It should have the autonomy to act without the intervention of local or national political influence.
__label__Evidence	I think Europol should stay an association of regular National Police Departments and not be turned into anything else.

__label__Position	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__Evidence	Fossil-sourced natural gas is as harmful as coal or oil. If it is sourced from fossil fuels, natural gas produces a net increase in CO2 in the atmosphere when burned.
__label__Evidence	Some biofuels, such as soy, corn, sugar cane, rapeseed, and palm oil encourage deforestation
__label__Evidence	Refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course. When it comes to crimes, people are simply no longer worthy of protection and cannot be expelled because their actions show us that they neither accept nor respect our rules.
__label__Evidence	All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified. Refugees/migrants are not to be expelled, certainly not immediately, but to be included in the employment problems and economic situation.
__label__Evidence	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people. If we manage to be a welcoming continent, the people who come will thank us by being part of society.
__label__Position	We should end mandatory retirement
__label__Position	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Evidence	A great idea because it definitely lowers the threshold.
__label__Evidence	It's high time that all broadcasting stations in the EU stimulate their journalists to cover European news as well.
__label__Evidence	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU
__label__Evidence	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to integrate people with different backgrounds within the institutions.
__label__Position	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Evidence	The more language communication skills around the closer we can get in this complicated world we live in. The fact it is a popular language around the world but not really recognized in Europe should change. I fully endorse its recognition in Europe.
__label__Evidence	Esperanto is a common language of citizens from all countries of the EU. Esperanto encounters bring them together for contact and understanding. The authorities of the European Union are called upon to support this direct communication of the citizens. It is our free choice in which language we want to talk to each other - please recognize and promote it!
__label__Evidence	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.
__label__Position	We should ban telemarketing
__label__Evidence	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex).
__label__Evidence	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.

__label__Evidence	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.
__label__Position	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__Evidence	if you want to save birds, you perhaps should think about domesticated cats and making modern buildings more bird-friendly. If you want to save insects, look at the way of land use and agriculture, and create insect-friendly gardens.
__label__Evidence	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.
__label__Evidence	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.

__label__Evidence	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.
__label__Evidence	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.
__label__Evidence	All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.
__label__Evidence	If the European Council listened to the results of the inquiry made by the European Commission. 'The EU was set to stop changing its clocks in 2021, but then came Brexit, the pandemic, and some messy international bureaucracy'.
__label__Evidence	Compulsory military training can also make people stronger physically &amp; emotionally.
__label__Evidence	Most of the reserve force will not be utilized, which means huge amounts of expenditure on trainings will go in vain.
__label__Evidence	Some people do not have enough strength to participate in such intense trainings. They may seem normal from outside but may have mental illnesses. Military trainings can be emotionally and physically daunting for them. In such cases compulsory trainings will be a threat to their life.
__label__Position	There should be centers of excellence in science and education
__label__Evidence	At present, most of the farmers in India are following chemical-based farming. But the food produced by excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can cause serious health problems when consumed. So, there is a need to address this, and Natural farming can be a solution to this.
__label__Evidence	Even though organic farming produces healthy and nutritious food, it produces greenhouse gases and thereby contributes to climate change. So, the best alternative is ZBNF.
__label__Evidence	With ZBNF, the government does not have to spend crores of rupees on loan waiver schemes.
__label__Evidence	The third agricultural revolution, which is also called as ‘Green revolution resulted in the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Chemical-based farming results in soil health deterioration, heavy water usage for crops, and high input costs. Organic farming was started as a solution to this. But it requires large amounts of manure & vermicompost. So, organic farming is quite expensive. But the Zero-Budget Natural Farming approach will require very fewer input costs and restores soil health and produces highly nutritious food.
__label__Evidence	ZBNF is a cow-based farming practice. So ZBNF will result in an increase in the number of cows. But cows produce Methane, Nitrous Oxide & Ammonia, which are greenhouse gases and hence contribute to climate change. Methane is more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide, which is another greenhouse gas. Comparatively, methane is 25 times more powerful than Carbon dioxide. Nitrous Oxide is 300 more powerful than Carbon dioxide. And hence it is not a totally safe option.
__label__Evidence	The name – ‘Zero Budget Natural Farming’ is confusing. If anyone hears the name for the first time, he/she will think that this approach requires no investment. But it requires investment to spend on labor, cow maintenance, and water. The costs are very low when compared with other forms of agriculture, but it is not completely zero. To avoid this confusion, ZBNF was renamed as Subhash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF). But, it was announced as ZBNF in the budget 2019.
__label__Evidence	We are witnessing farmer suicides in the past few years in several parts of the country. This is mainly because of the high input costs involved in farming. To raise capital, they are forced to take loans and if the crop fails due to various reasons, they are opting for suicide. Zero Budget Natural Farming will prevent farmers from getting trapped in a vicious cycle of debts.
__label__Evidence	In the 1960s, the Green revolution increased food grain production with the aim of achieving food security and preventing famines. At present India’s population is increasing. So we need an abundant food supply. This may not be possible if we completely switch to natural farming.
__label__Evidence	homeschooling is a good option for children who are bullied, giving them a safe place to learn

__label__Evidence	homeopathy does not have enough research to prove it works. therefore people are potentially putting too much faith in something which will not work.
__label__Evidence	homeopathy is scientifically implausible and produces nothing more than a placebo effect in patients
__label__Evidence	one single fact that when somebody receiving homeopathy there is no quaranties that these substances will be good for the patient.
__label__Evidence	study of over 100 trials, which proves that homeopathic treatment doesn't work and is no better than placebo
__label__Evidence	homeopathy if not used correctly for many ailments could make them worse.
__label__Evidence	Because most of its formulations are heavily diluted, most homeopathic treatments are safe
__label__Evidence	homeopathy causes harm because it is unregulated.
__label__Evidence	in conjunction with medical care, it can give people hope
__label__Evidence	homeopathy has no scientific evidence of efficacy and is equivalent to simply taking no medical action at all.
__label__Evidence	many people don't trust doctors and would rather take matters into their own hands; it's their body and they can try whatever homeopathic remedy they want
__label__Evidence	people believe it is helping when it is not
__label__Evidence	natural medicine is safer and is proven to work as well as traditional medicine.
__label__Evidence	none of the products have been tested and some actually have very harmful effects.
__label__Evidence	when people use homeopathy instead of traditional medicines their health can suffer.
__label__Evidence	there are no proven scientific studies that can back up the positive effects of homeopathic remedies
__label__Evidence	it is none of our business which treatment a person decides to pursue as long as there are no third party harms.
__label__Evidence	homeopathy has been shown to help ease pain.
__label__Evidence	homeopathy has no scientific support
__label__Evidence	to rely on what is mostly water to bring health benefits is not benefiting anyone except the seller of the homeopathic 'medicine'.
__label__Evidence	someone with a serious life-threatening disease might put all their trust in homeopathy rather than using more proven medicine.
__label__Evidence	people that could have survived with proper medical attention but instead take the path of homeopathy to their detriment is a tragedy.
__label__Evidence	homeopathy does not involve the use of addictive drugs
__label__Evidence	it's not proven that it actually works and might cause people who have problems to get worse.
__label__Evidence	homeopathic remedies have been shown to be beneficial in many illnesses, reducing the length of the common cold
__label__Evidence	homeopathy is scientifically unproven and thus constitutes a health risk.
__label__Evidence	homeopathy doesn't have the same scientific backing as traditional medicine
__label__Evidence	homeopathy is a great way to naturally cure or ease some ailments
__label__Evidence	Homeopathy expands the field of medicine, creating more research and discourse.
__label__Evidence	people should have options when in comes to their health. most people use homeopathy in conjunction with western medicines, and that should be their own decision and choice.
__label__Evidence	homeopathy is untested and not backed up by scientific evidence, allowing dangerous outcomes where unqualified practicioners can see vulnerable patients.
__label__Evidence	homeopathy creates the mindset that things such as vaccines can be replaced, which in turn can cause the death of others.
__label__Evidence	everyone should be free to use any type of medicine to cure their illnesses - it is not for legislation to dictate what they should do , that would be a violation of their right to freedom.
__label__Evidence	homeopathy is merely an alternative therapy, one people might seek as a less harsh, less dangerous alternative to standard medicine.
__label__Evidence	when modern medicine avenues have been exhausted, it is a valuable alternative to keep hope many homeopathic medicines are effective and help the patient to stay positive, which is half the battle sometimes
__label__Evidence	many people find symptomatic relief by using homeopathic remedies
__label__Evidence	Internet censorship helps in maintaining Cybersecurity.
__label__Evidence	Rapidly increasing piracy need to be curtailed through censorship.
__label__Position	We should reduce animal farming.
__label__Evidence	We should encourage people to consider the question: 'Do you think it is morally right to torture, mutilate, and kill animals needlessly?'
__label__Evidence	We can work together to encourage plant based diets and make the world a better place.
__label__Evidence	limiting the number of plastic types used for packaging will decrease the emissions caused by burning the used plastic packaging, as well as decrease the amount of plastic in the ocean
__label__Evidence	limiting the number of plastic types used for packaging will ease the process of its recycling
__label__Position	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good
__label__Evidence	There are whole regions that are completely energy-autonomous with wind energy, solar power & biogas - not only in developing countries but in industrialized countries as well. It's not a question of technology, but just of mindset & innovative arrangement.
__label__Evidence	Where energy costs for consumers are high in combination with renewables, it's mostly due to political decisions and market set-up, not due to technical issues. Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers.
__label__Position	We should put in place policies for the protection of insects
__label__Evidence	A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations, and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide.
__label__Evidence	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.
__label__Evidence	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.

__label__Evidence	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.
__label__Evidence	It would force manufacturers to build longer-lasting products, and therefore reduce the impact on the environment and resources
__label__Evidence	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values. They bring crime, terror, and chaos. And after all, if there are no more Europeans in Europe, then what will happen to our beloved continent?
__label__Evidence	Illegal mass migration is a tragedy. Those who organize and direct mass migration are guilty of a crime against Humanity. Soros and Lukashenka are prime examples of such criminals.
__label__Position	MBAs do not make good business leaders
__label__Evidence	The curriculum and the educational procedure in any MBA institutes lack hands-on practice over live projects in order to train them and give them a chance to work on their leadership skills. Instead of focussing on the technical aspects of business marketing, development of leadership along with interpersonal skills is extremely important.
__label__Evidence	MBA programs are the best in shaping personality and behavioural skills, which are the most essential qualities of leaders.
__label__Evidence	Learning everything by practice consumes time. Through MBA, we can learn management skills and skills to tackle real-life problems in businesses.
__label__Evidence	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.
__label__Position	Intensive livestock farming should disappear
__label__Evidence	The European Commission’sportrays migration as an opportunity only, a Fatality that cannot be stopped, and the only solution against aging.
__label__Evidence	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.

__label__Evidence	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.
__label__Position	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.
__label__Evidence	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.
__label__Evidence	Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!
__label__Evidence	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.
__label__Evidence	Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!
__label__Position	We should implement minimum EU social standards
__label__Evidence	To reduce poverty and inequalities, the EU should develop a legal framework guaranteeing minimum social standards, including decent living and working conditions as well as adequate social protection.
__label__Evidence	The EU has “beautiful” ideas and is working on legislation for animal welfare and the environment. But as long as EU subsidies still support mass animal farms, all of this is not credible!
__label__Evidence	India has already become a resource-scarce country. We are unable to deliver the basic necessities to genuine Indian citizens, and a large number of additional immigrants will further worsen the conditions. The efficient NRC will help us in identifying illegal immigrants and some steps that can be taken for their deportation.
__label__Evidence	Curbing their voting rights can be beneficial to us. As it will avoid illegal immigrants from swinging elections in favor of those who promise them legitimacy.
__label__Evidence	NRC sends a strong message that illegal immigrants are not welcome here.
__label__Evidence	The present process lacks impartiality, transparency, and equality. Updating or maintaining an NRC with such a huge population, and that too people with less income and low literacy is a very tedious task. And all efforts should be made to minimize injustice to anyone.
__label__Evidence	The NRC body and the Foreign Tribunals in Assam are functioning behind the curtains and its functioning is clearly signaling toward the ruling party’s agenda of getting rid of Minorities. Earlier retired judges were carefully selected for Foreign Tribunals but now any lawyer who is above 50 on 25 April 2015 and has 10 years of experience can volunteer for FT and gets a seat. Various online sources have reported that the FT is full of people sharing the ruling party’s ideology and are asked to perform well.
__label__Evidence	People are tired of showing their documents, and proving their identities but the Foreign Tribunals are never satisfied. Minor clerical mistakes have resulted in the listing of Indian citizens as Foreigners. At times FT has gone beyond scope of its power and ordered arrest, detention, revoked ration cards, etc. thus, troubling a poor Indian.
__label__Evidence	NRC increases the feeling of alienation among Muslims and animosity among orthodox Hindus, leading to communal unrest which is already on the rise since the BJP came to power.
__label__Evidence	With this faltering mechanism, already poor and helpless genuine Indians will lose their right to work, healthcare and education, and housing.
__label__Position	We should subsidize Wikipedia
__label__Evidence	A green initiative that I can endorse whole-heartedly. Rational environmentalism can save both our planet and our democracy (from the menace of the radical Greens).
__label__Position	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy
__label__Evidence	Not all combustion engines use petrol as a fuel - natural gas engines are way more environment-friendly
__label__Evidence	English is an international language and is spoken by most of Indians. So, if Hindi is made the national language, people who cannot speak Hindi will be at disadvantage in many things such as getting government jobs, understanding circulars, etc.
__label__Evidence	Some people are arguing that English is not born in India and hence we should avoid using it. This statement lacks logic because all the technological innovations we are now using were born in different parts of the world. We cannot reject things just because they are not Indian.
__label__Evidence	English is not native to India, but Hindi is.
__label__Evidence	Hindi is spoken by more than half of India. As no single language is spoken by the entire of India, it is much better to make the majoritarian language the national language.
__label__Evidence	Almost half of India’s mother tongue is not Hindi. There are 22 officially recognized regional languages in India. Making a majoritarian language the national language is unconstitutional.
__label__Evidence	Hindi is spoken by more than half of India. As no single language is spoken by entire India, it is much better to make the majoritarian language as the national language.
__label__Evidence	There are widespread protests against the imposition of Hindi because non-Hindi speaking states are much more comfortable with English than Hindi.
__label__Evidence	Some people are arguing that English is not born in India and hence we should avoid using it. This statement lacks logic because all the technological innovations we are now using were born in different parts of the world. We cannot reject things just because they are not Indian.
__label__Position	We need a better EU migration policy
__label__Position	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Position	Referendums are good for the society
__label__Evidence	It can be said that referendums are a direct form of democracy. As the people directly participate in the decision-making, avoiding any manipulation by their representatives.
__label__Evidence	Referendums at times can lead to ill-informed decisions. Since the general public is politically inexperienced, they may not be able to gauge the long-term implications of their decisions.
__label__Evidence	Referendums weaken the sovereignty of the parliament, where the decisions are made with thorough discussions and debate among the chosen representatives.
__label__Evidence	Referendums can educate citizens politically.
__label__Evidence	Referendums provide an unreliable view, as the general public may have less knowledge about certain issues so they can be swayed in any direction by the politicians through aggressive speeches, false data, etc. And the lack of knowledge will leave no other choice for the people than to believe those facts.
__label__Evidence	Referendums force governments to do what the people actually want.
__label__Evidence	The common man has a say in policymaking as he will be the one living under the new set of rules, he will be the one who will be most affected. So, at times the priorities of people are different from the priorities of the government, referendums can set things straight.
__label__Position	The EU should reduce its influence on its member states.
__label__Position	International cooperation with third countries in the field of migration should be developed
__label__Evidence	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.
__label__Evidence	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.
__label__Position	We should protect very large natural areas
__label__Evidence	To help achieve this, the EU should reduce its excessive livestock subsidies. An agricultural transition away from cattle towards plants would free up a lot of space
__label__Evidence	Very large natural areas need to be protected to promote wildlife and the return of self-sustaining and fertile biodiversity!
__label__Evidence	Though the markets are yet a little controlled, they are freer than before. Consumerism improved the standard of living of the common Indian middle class tremendously. In recent decades, the Indian government has been improving the markets in order to boost entrepreneurial activity.
__label__Evidence	The middle class benefited tremendously from consumerism. Increased job opportunities, wages, and cheaper goods helped raise their living standards tremendously. The new world order gave them hope that even they could have luxuries like the elite. Through business, they could climb up the social ladder.
__label__Evidence	On the economic side, consumerism had a positive impact. Due to the increase in wages, people started buying more. Due to increased demand, aided by increased supply (due to the setting up of factories) entrepreneurial activity got a boost. Businesses were set up, jobs increased, wages improved and living standards improved. Overall, the world took a turn for the better. This made everyone look at consumerism (or for them, vanity) in a different light. Instead of being a stigma, it actually became a boon.
__label__Evidence	Many people are dying of hunger in India. Hunger and malnutrition are the biggest problems India is facing right now. Beef is a cheap protein available to poor people. With the cattle slaughter ban, the malnutrition problem worsens further.
__label__Evidence	70% of the cattle in India is owned by marginal farmers. They cannot afford to maintain their cattle after the cattle stop providing benefits to farmers, like providing milk, dung, etc. The only way for farmers is to sell these old animals to slaughterhouses.
__label__Evidence	The cow is a sacred animal for Hindus. Killing cows hurts their sentiments.
__label__Evidence	It is not ethical to interfere with the food habits of others.
__label__Evidence	It is our responsibility to stop cruelty against animals. Article 48 of the Indian constitution mentions that the state should take steps in prohibiting the slaughter of cattle. Many slaughterhouses are still not following the rules to not harass the animals while killing. Animals are subjected to intense suffering at most slaughterhouses.
__label__Evidence	Taking action against illegal slaughterhouses is the right step, but banning entire cattle slaughter may not be the right decision by the central government. There are food security and livelihood security issues. It is the responsibility of the government to respect everyone’s choices equally.
__label__Position	The EU needs s common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Position	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act
__label__Position	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries
__label__Evidence	Subsidies for meat production and fishery not only have a negative impact on our environment - but they also destroy the economy in poorer countries in Africa! We really should find a way to stop these and get out of this vicious circle!
__label__Position	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Evidence	This can be a threat to privacy because this linking can lead to the profiling of voters. Several states collected caste, religion, and other sensitive information as part of aadhaar data collection. So, this can be misused by some politicians to selectively eliminate some voters based on their caste or any other identity.
__label__Evidence	If legitimate voters do not have an aadhaar or if they could not link it due to any reason, they will be removed from the list. For example, some homeless people do not have aadhaar cards yet. In the 2018 Telangana Assembly elections, linking aadhaar cards with Voter ID led to the elimination of 20 lakh voters.
__label__Evidence	There are fake and duplicate aadhaar cards too. So, linking aadhaar cards with voter IDs may complicate the issue.
__label__Evidence	This can be used to eliminate fake voter cards. Moreover, some people have voter cards in 2 or more areas. These duplicate voter cards can be eliminated by linking Aadhaar cards with Voter IDs.
__label__Evidence	This linking can clear the path to internet voting or e-voting.
__label__Position	The EU should promote organizations that teach the national language via Esperanto
__label__Evidence	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.
__label__Position	Homeschooling should be encouraged in India
__label__Position	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__Evidence	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime!
__label__Evidence	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.
__label__Evidence	European institutions should take factual studies of the relative harm of different drugs into account. A UK study has shown that drugs such as cannabis and many hallucinogenic drugs are far less harmful than alcohol. The study in question was conducted by David J Nutt, Leslie A King, Lawrence D Phillips, on behalf of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs
__label__Position	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
__label__Position	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__Evidence	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.
__label__Position	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists
__label__Position	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
__label__Position	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy
__label__Evidence	In the case of nuclear power, cooling is needed to prevent a meltdown. And if water is not available because of drought or freezing, earthquake or tsunami, etc, these gigantic steam engines have to be shut down, otherwise, they will produce highly hazardous outcomes.
__label__Position	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__Evidence	If you want to do it for nuclear power, then it would be better to do it for every single kind of energy production methods. It’s also important then to include the complete cycle of all the energies, the human cost, the extraction of primary resources, in the case of renewable energy, take into account the necessary energy storage, and so on and so forth.
__label__Position	We should subsidize stay-at-home dads
__label__Position	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable
__label__Evidence	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. They are internationally recognized & very precise. As far as I know, all or most countries have agreed on these goals. The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details.
__label__Evidence	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.
__label__Evidence	Glass is one of the biggest causes of human death for birds.
__label__Evidence	It is purely economic in nature and encourages excessive production and consumption.
__label__Position	College education should be free for everyone
__label__Evidence	Integrating one non-western immigrant cost ca. Euro 167,000,-. Who will be paying that ?
__label__Position	There should be a ban on Bandhs
__label__Position	Social media brings more harm than good
__label__Evidence	it gives people a platform to pretend, show off and to bully others. it also makes people believe that everyone else has everything they want and that their lives are perfect, leading to mental health issues.
__label__Evidence	social media results in the fomo culture which is unhealthy for individuals.
__label__Evidence	social media can be incredibly addicting and cause depression based on popularity contests. we shouldn't use it so much because it can cause suicide and cyber bullying.
__label__Evidence	social media brings more harm than good because it causes people to judge themselves too harshly in comparison of the seemingly perfect lives of others online.
__label__Evidence	social media itself is not the cause of the negative consequences, it is human nature. the platform merely provides unrivaled access to information and potential connections with other people
__label__Evidence	social media connects family members from around the world.
__label__Evidence	when a child has gone missing, posting a picture helps to find the child.
__label__Evidence	social media has some harms but brings more good. it makes people happy, otherwise they wouldn't use it. also, it allows people to connect from all around the world which increases social awareness.
__label__Evidence	social media helps in fast dessimination of vital information across to people all over the world.
__label__Evidence	social media has been weaponized by our adversaries to sow division and cause chaos
__label__Evidence	people are meaner to each other online because they can't see each other.
__label__Evidence	social media is used to collect money for the needy, connect friends, and organize group events.
__label__Evidence	social media is a wonderful thing. people have a chance to communicate with their favorite celebrities. they find new friendships, share life events, and have discussions about current events.
__label__Evidence	social media has made it more difficult than ever for people to interact face to face.
__label__Evidence	it provides people with connection. you can stay in touch with family or friends frequently and easily that without this platform might not be possible.
__label__Evidence	social media causes harm by people trying to live up to their peers.
__label__Evidence	when teenagers are on social media they sometimes bully their peers which is a reason for not having an account
__label__Evidence	social media does more harm as it emboldens people to be more self serving and vain as people do stuff on social media for likes and retweets.
__label__Evidence	social media gives it users a place to seek support when in need whether emotional or financially, things that would be more difficult if not impossible to do outside of their home.
__label__Evidence	social media is dangerous and out of control.
__label__Evidence	social media provides an easy way for people to bully others without having to face the person they are bullying.
__label__Evidence	social media helps effect real change in the world. entire movements, very important ones, have been born on social media that otherwise wouldn't have gained traction without it.
__label__Evidence	it is a platform that can harbor bullying and intimidation.
__label__Evidence	social media has brought a democratization of media to all those who are able to access it, allowing rapid discemination of news and protest groups to further their causes.
__label__Evidence	social media did not brings more harm than good because when people posting or sharing their opinions or argue about something people can benefit from it make people think outside the box
__label__Evidence	social media allows friends and family to stay in contact a lot easier.
__label__Evidence	social media is great because it can connect people across the globe. it was never before possible to have a live face to face conversation with someone than we can now with social media video apps.
__label__Evidence	social media allows its user base to hide behind a computer screen which enables them to act, do, and say things they would likely not do and shouldn't do, in public.
__label__Evidence	it instill a culture of selfish self importance
__label__Evidence	social media can help to foster radicalism & extremism
__label__Evidence	social media can be detrimental to mental health as it can lead to inaccurate ideas about other people's lives. this is because people will often post the best parts of their lives.
__label__Evidence	social media can be addicting, and since it is so easily accessible from a variety of devices, it can distract people from more important aspects of life
__label__Evidence	social media provides an easy and anonymous way for bullies to do their worst
__label__Evidence	social networks push people to isolate themselves socially
__label__Evidence	social media is addictive. people are spending more time in virtual worlds and less time experiencing personal human interactions.
__label__Evidence	social media is full of hate groups promoting their agenda.
__label__Evidence	social media allows children to gang up on other children and can lead to mental problems.
__label__Evidence	social media is a great platform to connect and socialize with friends and family.it has become a substitute for newspaper and is very reliable.
__label__Evidence	social media brings more harm than good because it allows bullying and online harrassment to take place completely anonymously
__label__Evidence	Social media brings people together who are separated by great distances.
__label__Evidence	social media fosters unaccountable hate speech and animosity towards others.
__label__Evidence	social media makes bullying easier.
__label__Evidence	social media provides ways for people to connect where they might not be able to otherwise. reconnecting with old friends, new colleagues, etc. is great via social media.
__label__Evidence	social networks isolate people and submerge them in solitary lives
__label__Evidence	if used properly it can reunite old friends and family and bring much pleasure.
__label__Evidence	Social media sucks people in and causes them to waste time they could be using productively.
__label__Evidence	it has beeen widely proven that social media deteriorates mental health for users, with even the social media companies admitting this.

__label__Evidence	hamas is too dangerous to allow in & the blockade should continue
__label__Evidence	the blockade of the gaza strip keeps more arms from entering through there which in turn saves lives.
__label__Evidence	the blockade makes it harder for the people in that area to make money, and their economy is on the verge of collapse according to world bank.
__label__Evidence	The blockade makes smuggling more profitable which is often linked to terrorist groups and is used to fund terrorist organizations.
__label__Evidence	While Israel is justified in its claims of self-defense against Hamas and other organizations that have used violence against the state, the response to this violence in the blockade is massively disproportionate and therefore unjustified.
__label__Evidence	blockade of the gaza strip is morally wrong.
__label__Evidence	Since the blockade began, it has failed to decrease Hamas activity or violence against Israel in any meaningful way, failing at its main objective.
__label__Evidence	the blockade of the gaza strip has gone on way too long and should be ended, this is not the united states fight.
__label__Evidence	blockading the gaza strip is no longer useful and those doing it could better serve elsewhere.
__label__Evidence	ending the gaza strip blockade would allow more freedom of movement of people and goods which may allow a better standard of living for the gazan people.
__label__Evidence	Humanitarian arguments against the blockade are overblown, as the blockade is not designed to prevent things like food and medicine from entering Gaza, but rather weapons and other resources that may assist Hamas.
__label__Evidence	Caste divisions are hatred among communities is increasing due to reservations. Many communities in several states of India are fighting to give them reservations. And the consequence is people are increasingly associating with their caste. The interesting fact is that before the first caste census by British government (1881) in India, many people do not even know what their caste is. From then, the idea of caste is deeply ingrained in the Indian society. Now the reservations are making the situation even worse.
__label__Evidence	In India, it's easy to hide some income resources and to get a false income certificate. Though the situations are changing for the better, it is not that difficult.
__label__Position	We should not produce unnecessary garbage
__label__Evidence	Things that are supposed to serve us for a long time, like a vehicle or telecommunication device or household implements should be designed to last half a lifetime under normal use. The quality of the building material should matter more in that instance, so less focus on recycling.
__label__Evidence	Things that are one-time use only, like most packaging and the like, should be radically focused on recycling potential.
__label__Evidence	EU must take action. Help those in need, but only those who respect legal boundaries. Mutual respect is a cornerstone in this subject where we must set limits to protect Europe.
__label__Evidence	EU must take action. Help those in need, but only those who respect legal boundaries. Mutual respect is a cornerstone in this subject where we must set limits to protect Europe.
__label__Position	We do not need any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Position	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
__label__Evidence	Currently the ETS only applies to certain carbon-emitting industries covering 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. To effectively combat climate change 40% is not enough. That is why the ETS has to be expanded to at least cover agriculture and transport as well. In Addition to the extension of the ETS the subsidies in fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) must be cut in the near future.
__label__Position	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Evidence	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border.

__label__Evidence	Wood should be used as building material & other meaningful products only. Anything else is a waste of resources. No fresh wood for paper, fast furniture
__label__Evidence	The traditional family is the cornerstone of European civilization.
__label__Evidence	The family is people's foundation and it rests on it all their lives and work, and this needs to be valued.
__label__Position	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__Evidence	wind and solar power sources are inherently non-controllable and destroy our landscapes and natural environment, with their multiple harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear energy is undoubtedly the best form of electricity production, massive and controllable, with no CO2/GHG emissions.
__label__Position	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.
__label__Position	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.
__label__Evidence	I am concerned about the source of some cotton, which is produced in Chinese detention camps. A unified EU mark of ethical & environmental principles would be a nice thing to have when deciding what to buy.
__label__Evidence	The vast majority of the victims of this genocide in China are Muslims. And yet, the Muslim countries see the USA and the West as their arch-enemies!
__label__Evidence	Sounds a little xenophobic. There is no concept of indigenous or aborigenous population in Europe, the only criteria is citizenship.
__label__Evidence	European Union has already forgotten for example about the Ingrian Finnish indigenous nation. We have our own unique flag, our own unique language (that only about 1300 people speak in the entire world), our own land that the Ingrian Finnish lived on before Russia took over Karelia and sent them all to labor work in Siberia, Karelian forests and Estonia.
__label__Position	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism.
__label__Position	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Evidence	Pushbacks may not be a nice way of operating. However, Brussels is causing problems by telling the whole World that everyone (7 billion people) has the right to apply for asylum in the EU. It would be much better by refusing admission to anyone appearing at the border without papers. The experience is that over 80% of the immigrants are not refugees in danger.
__label__Evidence	We need to legalize pushbacks as a tool to limit illegal migration.
__label__Position	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources
__label__Evidence	'People highlight various risks, but any generation technology comes with risks: the largest electricity-related disaster (Banquiao dam in 1976) took the lives of 200000 people (!) or just recently 70 people in Russia, but nobody talks about hydropower being 'deadly' or complaining about states providing insurance for such massive projects, because it happens for all projects of such scale.
__label__Evidence	There is no generation technology that comes with zero risks, and this is why we need to look at objective scientific indicators.
__label__Evidence	In the UK since 2015, there were over 80 PV-related fires, at least 1/4 of which were actually solar panels catching fire, releasing toxic smoke, and contaminating the ground with cadmium.
__label__Evidence	Limiting freedom of movement does not seem like a good idea to me. I think what you are experiencing is bad local management, with urban planning laws fast growth and traffic issues can be fixed and avoided altogether.
__label__Position	We should stop making one-cent coins
__label__Evidence	The convenience of carrying fewer coins is obvious.
__label__Evidence	A one-cent coin costs about 60% more to produce than it is actually worth.
__label__Evidence	So to support European citizens you want to take more money from them?
__label__Evidence	Having many individuals in the EU paying a voluntary tax can contribute big time to the perceived democratic legitimacy of the EU.
__label__Evidence	Tax should be compulsory, not voluntary! Yes, the EU needs to collect direct taxes! For example, taxes on companies, and green taxes (tax on non-recycled items, tax on carbon, etc), as all should be harmonized across the EU.
__label__Evidence	The money from this could be allocated to pan-European projects, new citizen services, etc, tangible and prestigious results that may prompt others to join in.
__label__Position	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__Position	There should be a European Common Defence and Security Alliance
__label__Position	We need Integrated migration and border policy.
__label__Position	We should establish a Russian interest including EU policy.
__label__Position	Nuclear disarmament is necessary
__label__Evidence	Experts have been discussing that the two major threats in front of us are Climate Change and Nuclear Weapons. And they have been urging for complete disarmament. To some extent they are right. When a nuclear bomb will explode the surface will become hotter than the sun and apart from the mass destruction and deaths, the generations of people and animals who survive will perish for many decades. Reports say that almost 2000 nuclear weapons are kept on high alert throughout the year. Any misunderstanding or miscommunication can lead to a disaster, and with the impulsive leadership we are seeing around the world possibilities are higher than before. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the symbolic Doomsday Clock by 30 seconds in February, which indicates how world leaders are failing in maintaining peace.
__label__Evidence	Several terrorist organizations are also trying very hard to obtain nuclear weapons. Now if by any chance they get nuclear arms there we can’t even imagine the destruction.
__label__Evidence	All the countries do not have very high security for their nuclear arms, apart from going into the wrong hands the system that controls them can also be hacked.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapons are extremely lethal and can wipe out life on the Earth, and have actually worked as a deterrence to full-scale wars. We have seen two world wars, and the second one came to an end with a nuclear bomb being dropped by the USA on Japan. Since then, we haven’t seen any open, full-fledged wars, not because there have been no tensions among the countries and we all are living happily, but because of the reason that most of the developed and developing countries have nuclear arms.
__label__Position	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from
__label__Position	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society.
__label__Evidence	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.
__label__Evidence	National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success. We need to be united, aligned, and, above all, independent from any extra-EU hegemon!
__label__Evidence	In this case, the service generates profit, not the product.
__label__Evidence	All this lengthens the life cycle of a product and reduces waste.
__label__Position	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees
__label__Evidence	"As per Gandhiji's words ""An Eye for an Eye leaves the whole world Blind"", bullet for bullet is not a right policy."
__label__Evidence	If we keep on forgiving the terrorists, terrorism will not be eliminated.
__label__Position	Men are silent sufferers in this modern world
__label__Position	Migrants should not be used for political blackmail.
__label__Evidence	Natural materials have a large carbon footprint. They require fresh water and land, contributing to the pressure on nature and resources around the world.
__label__Position	We should change our consumption habits
__label__Position	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration.
__label__Evidence	Islam represents the biggest threat to democracy in the EU since it’s not compatible with European values. Islam, it’s not only a religion but almost a constitution which trying to impose on European society.
__label__Evidence	EU leaders continue their naive policy of hosting millions of migrants from Muslim countries without taking into consideration the inability to integrate into society even after many generations, and the fact that the Muslim diaspora is controlled by their countries of origin, the most flagrant example is the interference of Turkey and its dictator Erdogan in the German elections calling the Turkish diaspora to boycott this election since none of the candidates please him.
__label__Evidence	Evil historic practices on women in the pre and post medieval period have been into oblivion. Practices like child marriages, polygamy, ban on remarriages, honor killings, Sati, Jauhar and Purdah are obsolete in today's world. With time, more such practices are being redundant and thus, increasing safety measures.
__label__Evidence	Women of our country have been and are achieving the epitomes of success and glory every other day. Prominent personalities like Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Sarla Thakral, Kalpana Chawla, Sister Nivedita, Sarojini Naidu, and many more have been conquering their respective fields for centuries. In recent times, Prativa Patil, Meira Kumar, Priyanka N., Mitali Madhumita, Tanushree Pareek are some of the women achievers to be the queens. With such accomplishments happening around, safety can be guaranteed to a big extent.
__label__Evidence	The National Crime Records Bureau states that happenings of crimes against women have risen from 273 per day in 2001 to 313 per day in 2015. This is not a good sign in terms of safety in India.
__label__Position	Solar and wind energies have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__Position	There should be no illegal migration.
__label__Position	There should be a European Army.
__label__Position	News channels are breaking rules to give Breaking news
__label__Position	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__Evidence	The bicycle should be the main mode of transport for a majority of citizens because it is faster, it is easier, it is healthier, it is cheaper, it is more convenient, and it is eco-friendly.
__label__Evidence	Having cycling and micromobility as primary modes also makes cities quieter, less congested, less polluted, safer, and simply more pleasant and liveable, particularly for children.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests should continue to be used because they provide valuable data
__label__Evidence	some people are highly intelligent but don't do well on testing so intelligence tests can't measure a true value if it's only testing with one method.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests can prevent someone from pursuing their passion which they may be able to achieve with hard work
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests help teachers and other school staff identify in where a student, or a whole group, is deficient.
__label__Evidence	intelligence test can cause certain students to be pigeon holed and cause them to have low opinions of themselves because they can not score as high as others.
__label__Evidence	iq tests are great for determining how smart a person is. this not only helps with getting into colleges and jobs but a person with a low iq can show that they are a prime candidate for public assistance.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests don't determine someone's real intellect. that is shown in their everyday lives.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests don't accurately measure intelligence because they are inherently biased towards the type of people who designed them
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are there to recognize kids who are smarter and to be given proper chance.
__label__Evidence	IQ tests can make test-takers discouraged if they receive a bad score. They may not make an effort to succeed, since they already expect to fail.
__label__Evidence	it is often difficult to use a standard IQ test to measure the capabilities of people who communicate in a non-standard way
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests unfairly punish intelligent people who are not good test takers.
__label__Evidence	it does because it is a test that cant cover a persons full knowledge or personality and may brand someone smart when they're not or stupid when they are smart andit could have a major impact on the person.
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests bring more harm than good because they undermine self esteem for children with lower scores than their classmates.
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests have been a tool used by Eugenicists to argue for the culling of certain racial and ethnic groups.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are just another tool for teachers to use
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests help to determine if a person is in need of intellectual help
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests can generate stress and cause poor performance of the individual because it consists of a comparison of their intellectual capacity with others
__label__Evidence	Testing anxiety can bias the results, leading to inaccurate results.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are really not so much about intelligence but about the ability to take a test so, of course, it does more harm than good in that it will label people wrongly based on their test-taking.
__label__Evidence	people that do well at intelligence tests are the ones supporting it, causing inequality in their favor, instead of using other empirically valid test.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests allow an unbiased mechanism to get extra resources to those that have a higher capacity for learning yet lack the economic mobility to receive these resources.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests can help specify a persons abilities allowing them to develop their skill and knowledge of a specific capability.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are a way to get a good idea of how smart someone is, even if the results aren't necessarily 100% accurate they give a good base to judge people on.
__label__Evidence	it gives people a feeling of superiority over others. some people are just not good test takers, it doesn't mean they aren't intelligent.
__label__Evidence	People possess many different forms of I Q, from logical IQ to emotional IQ and that might not always be highlighted in standard IQ tests
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests will cause children with alternative learning styles to fall through the cracks in the educational system.
__label__Evidence	intelligence test give some people a false sense of superiority and others a feeling of failure. the test does not tell how successful a person will be and their ability to function in the real world.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests bring more harm than good because it will give people low self esteem if they get a low score on the test
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests give confidence to those placed behind their level
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are unscientific and only give a narrow, limited view of ones skills and abilities
__label__Evidence	some people are very intelligent but have a difficult time when it comes to taking tests. therefore they could be labeled as less intelligent as they really are.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests often help children excel by allowing them to be placed in appropriate classes or programs based on their individual abilities.
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests can help to identify struggling or gifted students so that educators can accommodate to each individuals needs.
__label__Evidence	I.Q. tests provide genuine insight into an individual's capabilities
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are important for differentiating instruction for students that need it.
__label__Evidence	I.Q. tests are much too narrow and potentially dangerous if relied on to classify people
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests limit the possibilities because they are not able to show potential, just current knowledge.
__label__Evidence	intelligence test help students end up in classes that help them learn the best.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests bring more harm than good by focusing on strengths and weaknesses.
__label__Evidence	intelligence test are a cheap, easy option to sieve through a crowd and people should not take offence to that
__label__Evidence	the branding of a child by intelligence tests at an early age can cause grave damage, all for no proven education benefit.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are skewed toward upper class white males, making the test not a true measure of a person's intelligence
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests bring more harm than good since not all intelligence can be tested, for instance, one could be gifted socially and this cannot be tested.
__label__Evidence	I.Q. testing allows students to understand and focus on their intellectual strengths
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests bring less harm than good because the envelope of people
__label__Evidence	intelligence test are not fully accurate.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests seek to rank people based on an arbitrary test. it hurts the self esteem of people that probably have proficiency in a different type of intelligence that the test tests.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests bring more harm than good because people can get competitive over them which can lead to isolation.
__label__Evidence	"Children identified as ""slow"" or ""learning disabled"" are often put in special classes with lighter workloads, teachers expect less of them, and they end up far behind their peers."
__label__Evidence	a bad score in an intelligence test is a blow to people sense of worth, hurting not only their feeling's but also this society's development.
__label__Evidence	IQ tests allow teachers and parents to direct additional resources to children who need them the most, i.e., those with low IQ scores.
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests allow employers and schools to locate areas where test takers need to improve.
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests bring more good than harm because they equalize students from rich and poor backgrounds, since money cannot buy intelligence.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests can determine which area an individual excels at so they can take a path that will lead them to their greatest success
__label__Evidence	they help to identify gifted children and help parents to develop their children talents
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests allow employers to select and sort job candidates into roles that are best suited for their ability.
__label__Evidence	intelligence testing can help a child receive specialized assistance if found to be of a lower iq and requiring such.
__label__Evidence	they can lead to a feeling of insecurity
__label__Evidence	intelligence test ensure people are competent.
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests harm people by enforcing the concept of a uniform, almost two-dimensional intelligence, even though intelligence is a much broader concept.
__label__Evidence	IQ testing limits children by putting them into stereotyped categories.
__label__Evidence	iq tests can make people feel like a failure when they are actually smart.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests help to identify people that need extra help and therefore are an essential tool
__label__Evidence	Intelligence test provide metrics which cannot be accessed otherwise.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are essential because they ensure pupils receive the education that is right for them
__label__Evidence	sometimes these tests help identify people's strengths.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are focused on specific subjects and does not determine the accuracy and capabilities of abilities beyond a structured test.
__label__Evidence	measuring human intelligence based only on a standard iq test is highly deceptive
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are useful tools for schools and employers.
__label__Evidence	Cheating is rampant among wealthy students taking standardized tests for college.
__label__Evidence	i contest because the founding of each children's iq benefit them actually so parents or educators can proper put these kids in a design classroom or seek extra help to tackle their specific weaknesses
__label__Evidence	IQ tests allows students to understand and focus on their intellectual strengths.
__label__Evidence	IQ tests measure only a few types of cognitive abilities and do not account for the vast array of intelligence types
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests can do more harm than good because it labels the takers as gifted or failure and don't cover other forms of intelligence.
__label__Evidence	a person can be gifted musically, intrapersonally or kinetically in ways that are just as important as verbal or mathematical skill and these other types of intelligence are not easily measured by any test yet produced
__label__Evidence	the use of intelligence tests allows the identification of children who need extra help with their education
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests create a discourse about different forms of education and how they can be measured.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests put the focus at that immediate time of taking the test of whether a person can cope with being under pressure while taking a test, therefore, detrimental.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests provide valuable information about areas of weakness, meaning that the child can benefit from a specially formulated education plan.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests can be used in schools to give administrators guidelines on what certain students have to work on in order to graduate.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests can make people feel inferior if they don't score as highly as their peers and can cause all sorts of mental health problems.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are but one way to give teachers a means to see if a child needs special courses. an entire course of instruction is not based on just one test, it is only one tool.
__label__Evidence	this is beneficial only to the people who go to good schools and aern't living in poverty. these tests are unfair to kids in low income poverty areas. we should not have them.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests often are inaccurate and give bad results.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests help teachers to learn how best to teach certain students and are essential in this environment.
__label__Evidence	the intelligence tests help to know more about the children's abilities so we can draw better educational strategies for each type of need
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests bring more harm than good because it will make people feel dumb if they get a low score
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests helps to find out gifted kids
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests bring more good than harm because they let teachers identify gifted students who might otherwise go unnoticed because they are shy, ESL, or otherwise do not stand out at first.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests bring more harm than good because it gives some people low self-esteem when they don't do good on them
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests bring more harm than good because they justify pseudo-scientific discrimination against people of lower intelligence.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests could label a child as unintelligent when they are not fully developed and so stunt their intellectual growth by placing them in lower levels
__label__Evidence	there are many ways to express and assess intelligence and that might not always be highlighted in standard IQ tests that focus more on the logical, spatial, and verbal portions of human intelligence
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests have been known to help students be comfortable learning and studying among their peers based on aptitude
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are very useful to determine who needs extra help in core learning and who can be pushed to excel, meaning both high and low scorers are more equipped to reach their full potential.
__label__Evidence	these tests need to be stopped until they are able to properly assess intelligence in a variety of forms, currently they are discriminatory
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests bring more harm than good because they are culturally biased, so that minority groups and foreigners score lower than they should, which makes them seem inferior.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests can cause depression in children with low performance
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests are a waste of money and discriminate against some children
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests bring more good than harm because they let an individual know exactly what their potential is and can take learning paths accordingly.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests provide an easy way of assessing the capabilities of individuals.
__label__Evidence	it helps to provide how well a person understands the things they have learned
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests provide data that can help the takers work on their weak points.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests have been proven to have no predictive value in a person's ability to excel in education or the workforce.
__label__Evidence	Intelligence tests give us the ability to pinpoint topics that students struggle with so that educators can learn where to focus their efforts.
__label__Evidence	intelligence tests bring more harm than good because when one learns their number, then they try to live their life to that number.
__label__Evidence	without intelligence tests to use as a benchmark, it would be impossible to assess someones capability and provide them with appropriate level tasks.
__label__Position	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__Evidence	According to BBC: 'Bitcoin uses more electricity annually than the whole of Argentina'
__label__Position	Esperanto should be the common language for the European Union.
__label__Position	We should end mass migration together.
__label__Evidence	Youth is a minority that will face the negative effects of climate change without being able to sufficiently participate in climate governance.
__label__Evidence	Including young people in decision-making processes considering climate change could potentially help to address the gap between the widespread official rhetoric claiming a great interest in involving young people in discussion and policymaking when it comes to climate protection and politics in general and the reality that falls too often too short of these declarations.
__label__Position	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste
__label__Evidence	To create value directly in the rural areas, is very important.
__label__Evidence	Making compost out of organic waste and distribute it to gardeners and farmers will help to create value and a better environment.
__label__Evidence	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.
__label__Evidence	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.
__label__Position	We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines
__label__Evidence	Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions. Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe. The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable!
__label__Evidence	Surrogacy should not be banned as it is the woman's right to choose if she wishes to do this for another couple and be compensated.
__label__Evidence	a woman giving birth to someone else's child will cause that child to grow up and not understand who their mother is. it can lead to major depression and a very unhealthy lifestyle.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy shouldn't be banned because sometimes there is a health issue preventing a perfectly good mother from having a baby. she deserves to have a child and a surrogate is the only way to do that.
__label__Evidence	a surrogate carrying a baby could try to keep it since they gave birth to it.
__label__Evidence	sometimes the only way that people can have children of their own is by having a surrogate to carry the child.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy provides a family with a child and nothing is better than that
__label__Evidence	Surrogacy for money is effectively the sale of children.
__label__Evidence	Surrogacy is the only way that some couples will ever be able to have a child.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy is very important in helping couples who can't procreate have children.
__label__Evidence	there is too much potential for exploitation and abuse to allow surrogacy to continue
__label__Evidence	surrogacy allows people to have the family they have always wanted. it isn't someone's fault they cannot reproduce and if they want to become a parent it is a good option.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy can help lgbt couple have children.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy is hugely emotionally damaging on the birth mother, and is often only resorted to as a result of financial hardship.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy should be banned as it is put too much emotional drain on the individuals with high expectations that may or may not be possible to deliver.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy is like buying babies and it should be banned.
__label__Evidence	when a couple is not able to have their own kids by natural way, surrogacy is only the option and knowing that surrogacy should never be banned.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy is not a needed thing. there are enough children in need of adoption that using a surrogate to have a baby so it has your genetic makeup is just selfish.
__label__Evidence	Surrogacy reduces women's position in society by treating them like baby making machines.
__label__Evidence	women that are capable of giving birth can help those women who are not
__label__Evidence	having a child that is genetically connected to you is very important to many people
__label__Evidence	the couples who can`t have their own kids this is the only way to get them and should not be banned by all means.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy allows women to have a child who would not otherwise be able to become a mother
__label__Evidence	surrogacy allows women to be a mother and love a child she normally couldn't.
__label__Evidence	for some couples surrogacy is one solution to having a child that is from one of the parents
__label__Evidence	surrogacy has led to numerous problems in recent times. there's been cases of forced surrogacy. there's been surrogate mothers who refuse to give the child to the parents. it's safer to do away with it.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy is the only way some couples can have a family so should not be banned.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy is a way for couples that are otherwise infertile to have children.
__label__Evidence	this is too dangerous for the parents to be. often the surrogate mother changes her mind.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy gives those who can't have children a way to have them.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy is just another term for baby selling which is against the law.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy should not be banned because it benefit women or couples that cannot get pregnant themselves
__label__Evidence	surrogacy creates a host of complicated issues around parental rights.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy is the answer to prayers for many couples who cannot have their own child, the gift of a baby by the surrogate is the ultimate gift, the chance of a family.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy is an artificial means of creating more children. if a person can not have children then they should adopt since there are many children that need parents.
__label__Evidence	women are selling their bodies, and oftentimes, surrogates have a hard time giving up their child.
__label__Evidence	surrogacy lets a couple choose someone who matches their looks and genetics

__label__Evidence	Are IQ test really worth anything? Stick to teaching the language and basic values, the rest will follow.

__label__Evidence	The real problem, even with the war refugees is that once they enter the EU they do not want to return to their countries, even if the danger has passed. They even bring their family and other relatives!
__label__Evidence	This is a huge discrimination. Everyone should have the chance to develop to a personal level. Or should we all do an IQ-test to stay in our country? Because it could avoid dangerous things like rasicm.
__label__Evidence	Some of the 9/11 Terrorists were well educated. IQ proves nothing, I'd better welcome good people than smart people.
__label__Evidence	People from several countries are asking for asylum in Europe in hope of better life conditions. Those people aren’t guilty for being born in those countries and EU should support everyone.
__label__Evidence	This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.
__label__Evidence	IQ is not an effective measure of whether they'll be economically beneficial, suited to European jobs in high demand, likely to integrate/assimilate, their potential to cause crime etc.
__label__Evidence	This just seems like an overtly emotional suggestion that isn't too well thought out. It would cause far more problems that it solves.
__label__Evidence	The only ones who benefit from people having several citizenships in different EU countries are the governments because they collect money for issuing passports.
__label__Evidence	Why have several EU passports when they actually represent one and the same thing?
__label__Position	Stray animals should be killed

People should move into such jobs. For the manual work - there are robots coming. We should not try to distort market forces and stop development.
__label__Position	We should preserve bees and polling insects
__label__Evidence	Bees and pollination are essential for the sexual reproduction of plants and are an important factor in biodiversity.
__label__Evidence	The economic value of polling insects, often bees, is estimated by researchers to be EUR 153 trillion. 9.5% of the total value of world food production.
__label__Position	WikiLeaks is not a bane
__label__Evidence	Please consider this: right now in Africa several million people are half starved, and eat a meal a day at best. They live thanks to cheap agricultural products coming from Europe, because local stuff is too expensive for them.
__label__Evidence	It will take years before the local farmers will be able to give well paid jobs to the local workers. In the meantime you'll have a famine and a genocide. And I didn't even mention the effects of a sudden huge inflation wave.
__label__Position	The EU should extend the model of Pooling & Sharing European military resources beyond air transport.
__label__Evidence	payday loans create a more impoverished society with their crazy payback rates.

__label__Position	We should promote the use of nuclear energy
__label__Evidence	We should never ever allow any nuclear power after Fukushima!
__label__Evidence	nuclear power plants which, compared to fossil fuel-fired power plants, have decreased carbon dioxide emissions and produce incomparably less toxic substances, which, moreover, are not emitted into the air we breathe, but can be buried deep underground where they will not harm anyone.
__label__Evidence	At this stage it is not worth investing money in current nuclear technology, what we should be doing is investing more in research into nuclear fusion energy, which is really the clean and safe energy we need and which we are getting closer and closer to achieving, in order to have those artificial suns working as soon as possible.
__label__Evidence	Renewable energies should be our focus of action, especially how to improve the storage and transport of this energy precisely in order to be able to supply the countries that have the worst conditions to implement them.
__label__Evidence	Europe must be a place that follows science, and following science nuclear power is an important tool in our fight against climate change.
__label__Evidence	Worldwide, nuclear power has prevented emissions of 240 billion tonnes of CO2 and prevented 1.8 million lives due to prevented air pollution (Kharecha, Hansen 2013).
__label__Evidence	Nuclear power is safe - there are over 400 nuclear power plants globally, most of which have operated with no issues for the last 40 years, providing 24/7 electricity and preventing pollution and CO2 emissions. In terms of safety, including all accidents and pollution, nuclear power has caused 0.07 deaths/TWh, which is 40x less than natural gas and comparable with wind power (OurWorldInData 2021).
__label__Evidence	Nuclear power takes little space, and unlike wind and solar works 24/7 and 7 years to build on average.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable.
__label__Evidence	We are still living in a capitalism, so, the price will decide and the price of nuclear energy is the only energy price which is increasing steadily, while renewables become cheaper every year. Nuclear was always only subsidiesed by governments and never really standing on their own. The building process is slow, the price is high, no way, this could be a gain - if it weren't for the military.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. We have some conditions for sustainable green energy (at least solar, wind, biomethane etc.).
__label__Position	We should support Frontex.
__label__Evidence	Frontex is a key agency and is called to play a crucial role in the coming years. Yet, it lacks the necessary political support it deserves to carry out its mission.
__label__Evidence	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.

__label__Evidence	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.
__label__Evidence	Halting all immigration to EU from non-European or non-first-world countries will lead to an even more competitive advantage for the USA and other countries as our population is shrinking rapidly.
__label__Evidence	Japan was a global superpower once just behind the USA, however, it has a strict immigration policy. Where is it now in global power rankings?
__label__Evidence	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work! What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights

__label__Evidence	Vehicular pollution is one of the major causes of air pollution. By switching to Electric vehicles, we can solve this issue. As per the report by the government, with this move, carbon emissions will be reduced by 37% by the year 2030. This will also help in our fight against climate change. As India is committed to bringing down its share of global emissions by 2030 as per the Paris climate agreement, replacing diesel and petrol vehicles with electric vehicles will help us in achieving this goal.
__label__Evidence	As the number of people who are buying vehicles is rising, the air quality will worsen further. So, there is a need to address this challenge.
__label__Evidence	As of 2019, India is importing crude oil for 82% of its oil requirement. By using electric vehicles, we can reduce the dependence on other countries for oil imports.
__label__Position	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union

__label__Evidence	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals. It would be good for every person to be given psychotherapeutic advice once a year in order to be able to diagnose and treat mental disorders and illnesses at an early stage or even to prevent them.
__label__Evidence	A psychological examination should be part of child screening, together with counseling to parents (e.g. dealing with children’s own concerns and fears, or increasing self-confidence among children and parents). It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognize them in the home and learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health.

__label__Evidence	mandatory use of public defenders makes it more likely that a defendant will have a fair trial.

__label__Evidence	Public defenders cost the state too much money.
__label__Evidence	People should be required to use a public offender to better than chances of winning a case when they cannot afford legal counsel of their own.
__label__Evidence	people dont always know whats best for them, so they shouldnt be representing themselves.
__label__Evidence	The use of public defenders should not be mandatory because people should be able to provide for their own defense if they wish, since they know their own self interest best.

__label__Evidence	it prevents people from having a better defense than others due to their money.
__label__Evidence	public defenders are a drain on the judicial system because often they do not have their clients best interests at heart.
__label__Evidence	The use of public defenders should not be mandatory because it will discourage law students from going into criminal litigation, since the pay is much lower for public defenders than private.
__label__Evidence	public defenders are overworked and already with a low salary, thus they may not be that beneficial.
__label__Evidence	this would cause a decrease in pay for the public defender and lower the quality of representation as too many people will rush to the new employment opportunities regardless of their record..
__label__Evidence	The fact that poor people get stuck with public defenders while rich people get private lawyers contributes to disparate jailing and sentencing that overwhelmingly harms the poor.
__label__Evidence	everyone should have the same level of legal council.
__label__Evidence	People have a right to be represented by the best when they are facing potential fines, incarceration, or worse. Mandating public defenders strips people of this right.

__label__Evidence	using public defenders would be a fairer system ensuring that everyone has the same level of representation, not just those who can afford better.
__label__Evidence	The use of public defenders should be mandatory, so that corporations accused of criminal misconduct have the same resources that an individual would.
__label__Evidence	the traditional right to choose your own defender to represent you has worked well for centuries and should never be changed.
__label__Evidence	making the use of public defenders madatory would increase the number of miscarriages of justice since the best and most able defence lawyers would go to areas of the law where they can make the most money

__label__Evidence	public defenders are important to upholding our individual rights
__label__Evidence	if you have the financial means to employ the best defence, why shouldn't you be able to do that if it gives you a better chance of being found not guilty.
__label__Evidence	if someone has the means to afford the best representation they can, they should be allowed to do so in the interests of them getting the best defence.
__label__Evidence	public defenders should not be mandatory because it will affect peoples cases since they can physical tell them your story
__label__Evidence	Given that the state has near infinite resources to construct a case, defendants should not be constrained in their counsel, especially in a criminal case that could put a defendant in prison.
__label__Evidence	Mandating the use of public defenders ensures a fair trial for all.
__label__Evidence	if someone can afford a good lawyer you are violating their rights by stopping them
__label__Evidence	mandatory use of public defenders will raise the standard of the defenders and level the playing field
__label__Evidence	public defenders do not have an agenda besides the task at hand and are more efficient than a lawyer who is trying to rack up the fees.
__label__Evidence	the use of public defenders ensures that everybody, irrespective of status, has access to legal representation: this is a basic human right.
__label__Evidence	because the state pays for public defenders they have a smaller budget, meaning that valuable resources are not available which could compromise cases
__label__Evidence	some lawyers are superior, and forcing these to be public defenders would chase potential lawyers from the profession.
__label__Evidence	this takes away freedom of choice in terms of hiring a lawyer that suits your own needs.

__label__Evidence	the use of public defenders shouldn't be mandatory because people should be able to pick their lawyers not have one forced on them
__label__Evidence	public defenders already have an overwhelming work load, making their use mandatory will cripple the criminal justice system.
__label__Evidence	Making the use of public defenders mandatory is an unfair obligation placed on a state.
__label__Evidence	people should have the right to defend themselves if they think they can do the better job of it.
__label__Evidence	making a public defender mandatory takes away choice from those who may wish to find their own attorney or even just represent themselves.
__label__Evidence	the use of public defenders is a serious drain on the coffers of government departments, and proven criminals have no right to such expenditure.
__label__Evidence	public defenders are not always available and not really engaged for the defense of the accused. they seem to not gain real profit from the cases
__label__Evidence	people have the right to decline counsel, if they so choose. public defenders are already overworked, which causes them to unintentionally do an incompetent job in their clients' defense
__label__Evidence	if a person can afford someone other that a public defend, then that should be their choice. why should taxpayers pay for an attorney when a person can pay for one themselves.
__label__Evidence	the mandatory use of public defenders guarantees equality in the defense and the accusing party because the economic weight does not intervene
__label__Evidence	the use of public defenders should not be mandatory because a person should have the right to pay within their means any representative they wish.

__label__Evidence	The use of public defenders should be mandatory so that both parties have access to state resources in criminal trials.
__label__Evidence	The use of public defenders should not be mandatory because the quality of defense will be lower than private defense, which will lead to more wrongful convictions.
__label__Evidence	Having separate public and private defenders contributes to economic inequality by making it so poor people have to pay more long term cost (a convicted felon never getting hired again vs. paying a lawyer one time).
__label__Evidence	Public defenders are paid poorly and overworked, once people can no longer become private criminal justice lawyers no one will want to be a public defender and you will have a lack of lawyers.
__label__Evidence	to protect those who do not understand the law the use of public defenders should be mandatory.
__label__Evidence	anyone being charged with a crime should have an independent person helping him or her. sometimes it helps having a second opinion.
__label__Evidence	the use of public defenders should not be mandatory as you might get a bad one and then regret it for the rest of your life
__label__Evidence	a lawyer would provide better representation for his client than a public defender who gets paid a lot less
__label__Evidence	in order to make sure that cases aren't tied up in appeals courts, defendants who can't afford their own attorney should be mandated to use a public defender to ensure a fair trial.
__label__Evidence	the use of public defenders should be mandatory because nobody deserves preferential treatment.
__label__Evidence	people have the right to choose their lawyer. be it someone they pay for or representing themselves. that is an inalienable right in a free society. you can not force public defenders on everyone.

__label__Evidence	the constitution decrees legal representation of the people and mandatory public defenders allows for this right to be upheld.
__label__Evidence	public defenders can never be truly independent of the justice system that pays them, therefore they shouldn't be mandatory
__label__Evidence	The use of public defenders should be mandatory because it would encourage more of the best law students to become public defenders, if they want to be defense attorneys.
__label__Evidence	our constitution guarantees the right to a lawyer. a public defender should be mandatory to advise people that have no clue what they are doing.
__label__Evidence	The age of 18 years is considered a legal adult in India. They have voting rights too. But not giving them the right to marry the partner of their choice may work against their rights. In 2018, the Law Commission recommended lowering the minimum legal age of men from 21 to 18 years and suggested keeping both genders’ minimum legal age for marriage as 18 years.
__label__Evidence	At present, many girls are forced to drop out of studies for marriage. So, making the minimum legal age for marriage 21 will allow them to continue their studies. Thereby, many more women will go for higher education.
__label__Evidence	Teenage pregnancies increase the risk of high blood pressure, anemia, and several other health problems. It can also lead to the death of the mother due to pregnancy complications. So, raising the age of marriage for girls can reduce the chance of maternal mortality.
__label__Evidence	Early marriages result in several mental health issues in many girls. So, this move can eliminate this problem.
__label__Evidence	As several girls are married at 18 years, they are not having financial independence. This is resulting in dependence on their husbands for survival. The dependence will force them to stay in the relationship even if it is abusive. So, raising the minimum legal age for marriage can empower women and can help them in achieving financial independence before marriage.
__label__Evidence	As per the government data of 2017, the average age of marriage for women is increased to 22.1 years. So, the change is voluntary. The change was mainly due to the improving education among women. So, the solution lies in encouraging education for girls, conducting awareness programs on the importance of education, financial independence and the consequences of teenage pregnancies should be conducted instead of passing a law to bring a real change in society.
__label__Evidence	At present, child marriages are happening throughout India even after ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, of 2006’. As per the National Family Health Survey (2019-2021), 1/4th of the women aged 20-24 years were married before attaining the age of 18 years. After the pandemic, the number of child marriages increased significantly. So, the problem lies in the implementation. Hence the law alone cannot bring a change in society without proper implementation. Root causes should be addressed before bringing a law.
__label__Evidence	Several girls are being forced into marriages due to the patriarchal mindset of their families. Until now, many girls of such families rebelled against such forced marriages and married the person of their choice after attaining 18 years with the help of legal support. But now, they have to wait till attaining 21 years. This will be misused by patriarchal families to threaten and control them.

__label__Position	We should limit the use of fireworks
__label__Evidence	I have also seen ex-soldiers shaking after someone sets off loud fireworks. Yes they should be banned. Abhorrent things.
__label__Evidence	All animals from dogs, cats, birds, cows, pigs, and horses (the list is long) suffer from human use of fireworks! The high bursts and flashes cause anxiety in the body.
__label__Evidence	Fireworks are an especially selfish source of entertainment.
__label__Position	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools
__label__Evidence	Makes sense to me, its easy to learn and doesn't come with any nationalist baggage.
__label__Evidence	EU lacks a common language for its citizens, which would be easy to manage for all citizens and strengthen a sense of belonging, a common European identity while preserving their national identities.
__label__Evidence	I can't endorse this. Esperanto isn't neutral. It favors Spanish speakers. Meanwhile, Slavic speakers are at a disadvantage. So why not one of the Slavic artificial languages?
__label__Evidence	Esperanto can be a new tool for a more united European Union.
__label__Evidence	Europeans must embrace true values that enhance life and standards of living. Anything related to drugs, in whatever form, degenerates humanity. Soon enough we will be legalizing 'theft' in an effort to improve GDP and growth, as European colonialists have done in Africa and Asia where oppression and exploitation ruled.
__label__Evidence	The European Parliament is in dire need of reform. It has become a circus, where the MEPs engage in wild ideological posturing without substance. The EP's function is to address the pressing needs of EU citizens, but it hasn't done that for ages. One possible solution could be to replace it with a legislative body that is made up of delegates from member state parliaments.
__label__Evidence	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution. It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament.
__label__Evidence	The Russians use the money we give them in exchange for gas to spread disinformation, and propaganda and finance the terrorists in the Donbas and its mercenaries (Wagner Group) in Libya.
__label__Evidence	The cost of gas will be higher. But I prefer to pay a little more for the gas bill than to finance Putin’s malicious activities.
__label__Evidence	Investing in R&D will create an incentive system for businesses to start with green solutions.
__label__Evidence	Agrivoltaic could be a perfect model for an energy cooperation of citizens to own some greenhouses with photovoltaic & rent them for a small fee to a urban gardening cooperation of citizens, for example.
__label__Evidence	Subsidizing big agricultural companies is not the problem here, it's the criteria by which the subsidies are distributed.
__label__Evidence	Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are by far the most important neighbors of the EU. A good relationship with all three is very desirable for the EU. For that, we would have to be willing to understand their history better.
__label__Evidence	The Russian Federation is our neighbor. We share common historic and cultural ties with them. Today the EU confronts Russia with sanctions. An understandable reaction to its actions in Ukraine and failing democracy. Let us not forget actions done by others (US intervention in Iraq, the Chinese in Tibet and their treatment of minorities, etc.). Yet we close our eyes.
__label__Evidence	Russia is troublesome with its own agenda and unconventional methods. Perhaps due to a heritage of a system, that is no longer the norm today. Remember, they fought next to us and Russians merit our hand reaching out to them. A policy change to show empathy, foster closer economic ties, and build on bilateral projects and partnerships in various cultural, scientific, trade, or economic programs.
__label__Evidence	Including Russia in our sphere of friendship would allow the EU to discuss certain values from within and coax them toward democracy and change. Economic partnerships can act as leverage. Friendly ties, in time, will bring common views to prevail.
__label__Evidence	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.).
__label__Evidence	Many people, even in the richest European countries, work hard, work overtime or have several jobs & cannot sustain themselves. That's humiliating, time-consuming alien to physical & mental health, and poisoning society.
__label__Evidence	Nations that have adopted living wages for full-time jobs have highly profited from that step. It's been an economic booster because if people who earn & possess little can afford what they need, they will buy. So they increase demand. Demand increases supply. More supply means more jobs, more suppliers, lower costs, etc.
__label__Evidence	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Evidence	this could be done by filtering terms
__label__Evidence	The level at which data can be tracked/who this data gets given to could cause repercussions of privacy especially with things like GDPR
__label__Evidence	the things is they might create fake accounts or have bots commenting on their behalf.
__label__Position	"Hate speech is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as ""public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation""."
__label__Evidence	"""Comments are often regarded as a right but they can do more harm than good. In the absence of strict moderation, we’d be much better off without them"""
__label__Evidence	but AI is still weak right now to filter hate speech comments efficiently
__label__Evidence	it does indeed,  I doubt most MP's know what the word means
__label__Evidence	Cost of living isn't the crisis that everyone harps on about.  
__label__Evidence	"I suppose the problem here is what a person says is their version of ""free speech"" could easily be seen in a different context by a reader.  It's a very difficult issue to get right."
__label__Evidence	yes free speech should be protected
__label__Evidence	I think these people will then keep living in their own bubble and will never learn that their philosophy isn't normal.
__label__Position	Denying people of their freedom of speech is not the solution to eliminating hate speech. There should be a set of rules that when broken there will be serious consequences especially if the hate speech does more damage to a person's wellbeing.
__label__Evidence	This sounds easy enough to implement however it begs the question as to why it has not been done already does it not?
__label__Evidence	I totally disagree with this because this sounds like a violation of of the human right to freedom of speech. Also, this means that newspapers will be able to get away with publishing articles that the general public does not agree with without any repercussions.
__label__Evidence	this would be a good start, i think that having a moderator would help to eliminate hate speech
__label__Evidence	But how would one be able to determine what is hate speech and what isn’t? For example someone could say the word n*gger in context of a historical discussion. Some black people would consider it hate speech and others wouldn’t. With people deciding what is and what isn’t hate speech with their subjective opinions, genuine non-hatefuelled opinions would not be posted and as a result this method would inhibit free speech unfairly to some degree.
__label__Position	 Challenges include reduced yields, land demand, nitrogen needs, changes in diet, food waste, distribution and access to food, and externalities.
__label__Position	"""In my experience, social housing can be particularly difficult because one needs to design for the worst case in terms of occcupancy levels and behaviour. But this can make both the retrofit and often its maintenance unaffordably expensive. Is Clarion (and Wales) finding ways around this?"" (Bill Bordass) "
__label__Position	As long as there is a good hate speech policy and auditing them comments should remain. Check out what twitter does to keep their platform free of hate speech
__label__Evidence	By making rules it means they might lose a some of their viewers because most people are disrespectful and hate discipline
__label__Evidence	Is there a limit as to what hate speech is and what it isn't? Could someone write the rules to be overly enforcing and cause more issues and more hate?
__label__Evidence	It is very very concerning how so many people seem to have developed short-term memory loss (for the last 5 years) when it comes to the shameful, insulting, disrespectful actions of those who are in-charge of our well-being as a nation
__label__Evidence	I think people may give false information (data)
__label__Evidence	Some of the thoughts that people need to 'clear' may offend others.
__label__Evidence	Someone needs to be employed to regulate the chat
__label__Evidence	I would be inclined to agree with this. We also  rely on immigration to perform in jobs that a lot of entitled british folk feel above / would rather take doll 
__label__Position	multiple moderators and a strict system is key. my employing multiple people as moderators, you can make sure that there is not a single person making decisions from their own point of view. you should have different people with different opinions on the same team to make sure that the fairest outcome is guaranteed. if all else fails, there should be a set of rules that help make the decision
__label__Evidence	I can see their point of view, however hate speech can't be considered a viewpoint as most times there isn't even a good enough argument to support people that leave hate speech's point of view.
__label__Position	Discussion during the set-up of this project showed that there may be some significant areas of disagreement between heritage and climate practitioners. One obvious one is installing solar energy systems on older buildings. Deep retrofit may also be problematic. If we are to avoid turning these issues into disputes then it will be important to start by working out where there is consensus. Assuming that we accept the need for net zero then the question is how do we achieve that in situations where current tools for deploying clean energy may not be appropriate. Positive communication will be important to help us all see what good practice looks like and also how we agree for criteria for such practice.
__label__Position	The key issues imporatnt to me when deciding how to vote have been the cost of living crisi, the state of the NHS and other public services amd underfunding in education.How poverty has increased under the current government and how the pandemic was handled have also been major factors for me. 
__label__Position	Wanting to get the Tories out and build a better Britain that is equal, safe, and prosperous for everyone
__label__Position	Simply removing the comment section on newspapers websites seems too simple to be effective. Hate speech are allowed by the fact that people are fairly anonymous on Internet. So a solution would be to implement some kind of ID check before creating a profile allowing to comment. If someone knows they can be traced back, their speech will also be not hateful.
__label__Position	Hate speech needs to be clearly defined, but once it is it should be defined and posted clearly somewhere on the website, for example 1) No disrespectful comments on the grounds of race or gender. Software or moderators can remove such comments. However this should not overreach to healthy debate, not every negative comment is hate speech.

__label__Evidence	However people who don't feel heard will often go to where they do feel heard. So finding a way to balance the correction of their hateful views while restricting their access for sharing them is the struggle.
__label__Position	I want the new Government to improve the state of the UK economy
__label__Evidence	It gives them freedom of speech and a chance to express themselves.

__label__Evidence	freedom of speech should be allowed anywhere
__label__Evidence	Everyone has an opinion, and I agree that no one should be silenced. However I do not believe that the comment section of a newspaper article is where people should have the freedom to write hate
__label__Evidence	I agree with this as it reflects my own view. Moderation is the way to go and not removal

__label__Position	I believe that newspaper websites can create an algorithm that filters certain speech that is negative and harmful. They can have systems in place to delete comments that are hateful and keep positive comments to still allow for others to freely share their opinions.
__label__Position	Pros
__label__Position	The cost of living, education, the dire state of the NHS
__label__Position	And also media contents should be cross checked and should publish truth only without hurting the parties involved personally.
__label__Evidence	it needs completely re-structuring from the top, throwing more money at everything isn't always the answer when its poorly managed 
__label__Evidence	Cheaper to fly out the country than get a train for a few hours
__label__Evidence	Agree, they have ruined the country
__label__Position	Getting the Conservatives out of government
__label__Evidence	who gets to jugde what is allowed and whats not.
__label__Evidence	I absolutely agree with this. As we've seen recently (https://medium.com/dfrlab/alt-right-and-alt-social-media-4fa23eb2fbd1) cracking down on the more ofensive comments on one website can lead to groups of people finding a more lenient place and bunching up there, creating a vicious cycle where they push each other to be more and more extreme. It's true that we should monitor the comment section, but overdoing it could lead to worse results somewhere else.
__label__Position	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__Evidence	What is considered free speech (and should therefor be allowed) depends heavily on the location of the platform and the user. In the US free speech is protected by law to a much greater extend than in Europe.  In the US there are only a few categories of speech not protected by the First Amendment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions), like incitement to lawless action. In Europe however free speech stops there where it infringes on someone else their rights, for example the right to not be discriminated against. Racism and targeted hate for that reason is not protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) or the national laws of many of the European countries.
__label__Evidence	Its not just the cost of living though, it is the massive gap between rich and poor. 
__label__Evidence	Really like that idea
__label__Evidence	I have always voted, even when the only choice was between two bad candidates - women died for my right to vote!
__label__Evidence	sdfdsfsf
__label__Evidence	"I think this is good and supports freedom of speech, but at the same time, we cant really control ""aggressiveness"" in people especially considering that the degreees of acceptable aggressiveness varies with each person"
__label__Position	I think hate speech can be curved not by removing the people that spew it but rather, instead find ways to identify the profiles of the culprits and redirect them to a server with other people that spew hate where their comments are seen by other offenders and not people who are trying to engage in honest discussions
__label__Position	Drawing the line between Freedom of speech and hate speech is critical, strict moderation and being able to hold people accountable will ensure hate speech is low. Moderators will just need to act impartially.
__label__Evidence	Software is efficient

__label__Position	It can certainly be argued that hate speech is nothing new https://blog.ongig.com/diversity-and-inclusion/human-rights-policy-hate-speech-policy/
__label__Position	Would love rejoining the EU (or at least closer ties) to be more of thing this time. Only the SNP offering that choice
__label__Evidence	Because people are flawed and invested in themselves first, it is hard to get cooperation from all sides to do something about a polarizing thing like climate.
__label__Position	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common. Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__Position	In addition to the moderation, checks can be used (for example filtering software) to filter out common slurs/ derogatory words in order to make sure comments with such words are not posted to the comment section
__label__Position	"""Three pillars of sustainability: economic, societal, environmental"" (Esther Robinson Wild)"
__label__Evidence	To reduce hateful speech on newspaper website, I think every newspaper must have their own admin, who monitors the comment posted and remove hateful speech and if an indvidual continue they must get blocked.
__label__Position	What is most important to me is what the parties are standing for in regard to the NHS, Education, Tax and the economy. What aligns with my values, this is what I will vote for.
__label__Evidence	everyone should be entitled to free speech
__label__Position	"""It is important to attract young people to study the built environment, sustainability, civil engineering, just as they currently focus on building new information systems. If we don't make these topics attractive to young students, the skills gap will only increase"" (Paul Norman, Clarion Housing Group)"
__label__Evidence	Can be misunderstood
__label__Position	it is the responsility of the newspaper team to ensure that no hate speech is in the comment section despite it being about journalism
__label__Evidence	I totally agree with this statement.
__label__Position	"The newest ""science"" related to this topic now questions how additional greenhouses in our atmosphere truly effects atmospheric and climate change. It looks to be that additional carbon dioxide does not have as dramatic an effect on temperature as previously purposed. This is cause to re-question what actually would need to be reversed and how much influence our consumption of fossil fuels actually has on global climate."
__label__Position	I'd like to see consequences for the dodgy dealings around covid contracts and Brexit. It all absolutely stinks.
__label__Evidence	Totally agree, climate and people's welfare are the big ones 
__label__Evidence	I disagree, the person commenting can do so in a manner that isn't hateful. Only people who choose hate as their platform in getting their opinion across will be blocked. Hopefully these people rethink their approach and try again in a different manner
__label__Evidence	Democracy dies in darkness. Commentary on news was made to spark debate and deeper thought about new events. I feel something is lost if we remove this feature from news articles.
__label__Evidence	I work in nhs and it’s shocking lack of resources and staff 
__label__Evidence	too much money being wasted by those at the top that have no real idea of how bad things are on the front line
__label__Evidence	14 years is long enough, especially when the situation, ie. immigration is getting worse 
__label__Evidence	Could become another arena for political battles
__label__Position	social disparity, cost of living 
__label__Evidence	Algorithms can't be depended on. They will likely hold the bias of the creator or can't be smart enough to be reliable sources of end of for comment removal.
__label__Position	We are simply not prepared to give up on our modern lifestyle to achieve this. Nobody wants to give up his cheap flight to exotic destinations, his big petrol car, cheap electricity, ...
__label__Position	newspaper might remove comment section as a way to prevent hate speech. however, it does remove freedom of speech to those who would like to express themselves through comment section.
__label__Position	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__Evidence	The under funded NHS is a priority, also add the underfunded schools to this as that's also a mjor concern
__label__Position	should be open to all
__label__Evidence	There is very little space for fake news to emerge as media houses would have approved the content or regulated the comment
__label__Evidence	If we were more careful with who we allow in the country like Australia we may not be in the financial state we are in 
__label__Position	Everyone needs to be clear that sometimes the comments are purely other peoples opinions and not facts.
__label__Position	I feel that we should have freedom of speecha and people should be allowed to make comments but they could be monitored and regulated to check for trouble causers and trolls
__label__Position	but Reformhave no policies other than to pull up the drawbriddge
__label__Position	The comment section should not be removed all together however it can be used to monitor the hate speech that is going on offline. Removing the comment section would mean losing insight that would be otherwise valuable to society. Take a look at this link down below for the importance of monitoring hate speech. https://akademie.dw.com/en/the-importance-of-monitoring-online-hate-speech/a-19104789
__label__Evidence	"Opinions shouldn't be classed as ""hate speech"". If some people (snowflakes) get triggered by different points of view they should refrain from reading the comments section rather than whine about ""hate speech""."
__label__Position	I think thoughtful people have been marginalised in favour of people with prejudices and judgemental reactions. Itr will be nice to have government that governs for most and not the extreme minority
__label__Evidence	Free speech is the cornerstone of democracy - it can be political but it doesn't have to be. Democracies should protect those that are vulnerable from abuse online whilst also preserving the spirit of free speech. If this balance can't be achieved then it is dictatorship / authoritarian territory.
__label__Position	We should work to stop polluting the planet just for this sake alone. Who doesn't want a cleaner planet? 
__label__Evidence	I agree with this, and I think it is made more difficult by fast-moving technology and information on what's most effective.  What is the best source(s) of information for each of the groups needing to know more? Can we build a list? 
__label__Position	wanting to protect my money and assets from labour
__label__Position	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it.  https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__Position	Govern social media: Many of you who are reading this post are probably wondering how you can regulate social media without removing the freedom of the press. Education of the legal and ethical issues affecting the media can improve press freedom. Encourage victims and witnesses to come forward with information about crimes involving hate speech. Hate speech is still mostly invisible since many victims are unaware that they are being the targets of it.
__label__Evidence	It is possible to use evidence based methods to apply this type of solution, then its a question of automationon
__label__Evidence	Agreed, I have two young children and this worries me - as well as online content/social media and the lack of impetus the government has put of challenging large social media corporations 
__label__Position	I feel as though keywords and more stringent moderation can only help the situation
__label__Evidence	Whilst moderation can be good, you're at the whims of the moderators own thoughts and prejudices. And at times may not be acting in the interests of the organisation they're working for.
__label__Position	banning repeat offenders and identification of trolls should be tightly managed.
__label__Position	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__Position	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__Evidence	If 99 out of 100 people are having a normal civilised debate, 1 'troll' can muddy the waters of the whole community, without some vetting of posts it would be a mess
__label__Position	People can give opinions on something they like or dislike, like foods or entertainment but 'opinions' on the rights or existence of a marginalised group is not the same thing. It's easy to say that people shouldn't be angry at the opinions of others, but when that opinion is that you don't deserve to live because of something you have no control over i.e race, gender, sexuality - is a whole different thing.
__label__Position	public sector pay
__label__Evidence	i ddoubt this would work too well
__label__Position	Cost of living and the economy.
__label__Evidence	Yes, but we will not have the money to address it while we spunk it all on illegal migrants and Net-Zero
__label__Position	In the face of complexity and diversity in buildings, do we seek to simplify the message (inevitably losing important information) or do we seriously invest in the skills and knowledge of designers and installers? (Gavin Killip) 
__label__Position	health care
__label__Position	In summary, I believe that comments should be encouraged, and healthy discussion allowed on these sites. Comment spaces should not be removed but they should be regulated and monitored for such speech. Education should be given to users making hate speech, if this is not successful then punishments should extend froma  temporary ban to a permanent one.
__label__Position	I think that, no matter the time cost, this is an essential step in the right direction. Technology is so advanced, I'm sure we can keep the readers comments sections while monitoring and dealing with hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Education = respect
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	At the same time, this seems like it would have such potential for corruption - who programmes the software? Newspaper sites could simple auto-remove any comments that disagree with them.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely, if you are discussing the topic at hand - articles are meant to engage readers and grab their attention.
__label__Position	I believe that hate speech comments should have flagged and removed buy moderators
__label__Position	Key issues - Housing; austerity measures (by existing government); contract tendering corruption (by existing government).
__label__Position	When you are found commenting with hate speech you should be arrested
__label__Position	There needs to be a comment section in order for readers to engage and learn.
__label__Evidence	I think that removing the comment section on specific topics is important
__label__Position	All members of the public should be asked to create online profiles in order to add comments. If anyone then writes harmful comments the can be tracked and their account can be terminated.
__label__Position	Heritage buildings includes the 30% of existing dwellings that are of traditional construction (solid walled or narrow 'rat-trap' cavity). Improving energy efficiency is important, but can be substantially achieved without deep retrofit, through a mix of appropriate repair, improvements to heating systems, enhancement of existing windows, and some insulation, as well as some behaviour change. Inappropriate retrofit will have unintended consequences including poor occupant health, fabric damage, harm to heritage value AND net carbon emissions. Relaxing regulation or weighing carbon emissions more heavily against heritage value would therefore be highly counterproductive.
__label__Position	We need to consider everyone has there own opinion and entitled to give this, it just needs to be managed so that is is done fairly and responsibly.
__label__Evidence	It is a lenthy and compelx issue since different countries seem to have different rules and law governing freedom of speech according to their cultures or even political establishements
__label__Evidence	The tax burden needs to be shifted up the pyramid, particularly around the financial institutions and high-end tax avoidance. I would put a punitive tax in hedge funds to discourage financiers from making money from companies failing 
__label__Evidence	I disagree as some comments are constructive and may help other users. Otherwise you just get an echo chamber.
__label__Evidence	This doesn't make any sense though, you're saying we couldn't do those jobs because there is no training yet somehow someone can immigrate to the UK AND still manage to train and get the jobs? I worry that we're just entitled and lazy in the UK 
__label__Position	Removing the comment space will not constitute a fair way of dealing with this issue. Maybe keeping the comment section and restricting each users comment ability would be a bette r option
__label__Position	Crime and lack of jail places
__label__Position	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social  media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them. Because the truth is, nobody starts out as a hater but radicaliz ation can happen to anyone. check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g
__label__Position	As much as it might seem an attempt to constrict expression of thought, I agree comments should no longer be allowed. It always turns into argument and insult. We already know that for every opinion someone else will take the opposite view. A newspaper's view is its own, so let's keep it that way - we already know which way they lean politically. Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.
__label__Evidence	I'm also not on a large income but agree. I'd rather sacrifice a few percent of my wage for better services for all 
__label__Evidence	Absolutely the main issues
__label__Position	Everyone shoould be able to express their own ideas but we could have some kind of protection in words the should not be allowed and also have a way to keep moderators on the website, people could be warned that they are doing something wrong and be explained that there IS NO HATE SPEECH and be offered maybe some way to express herself without hurting or damaging others.
__label__Position	Free speech is an important component of society and comments on newspaper articles can often enhance the article itself by providing additional evidence and balance. However, the anonymity of the internet allows for extreme views to be aired that go beyond what a newspaper website is comfortable publishing. To address this, both automated bad language detectors and a set of both editorial and user moderators should be present. A final point is to allow post-moderation, e.g. users can report offensive topics to the moderators.
__label__Position	The rising temperature causes all the problems .The human cause of climate change is not disputed by any scientific body
__label__Position	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.
__label__Evidence	Lack of accuracy due to reliance on tech, opportunities to get past algorithm
__label__Evidence	It would be hard for anyone to not be bias as we have different opinions on subjects and one might thing that the  comment is appropriate and someone else might not think so. It can be subjective at times.
__label__Evidence	It may be difficult to determine what qualifies as  verified  and  non-polarizing  information
__label__Evidence	this article : https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006  indicates that the algorithm that is considered to be the best for removing hate speech is still only just over 71% effective. This still leaves a lot of room for error.
__label__Evidence	it also highlights the wider problem in society
__label__Position	Which politician I can trust to do what they say
__label__Evidence	https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Position	By developing a system that will automatically eliminate any hate speech comments before some sort of publication.
__label__Evidence	what is considered non-beneficial to a discussion. (there becomes an issue with bias and matter of opinion)
__label__Position	Freedom of speech doesn't equal to freedom of consequences. Hate speech entails inciting violence and hatred towards often already disenfranchised groups of people; it's not done in the spirit of good faith discourse. Hate speech doesn't need to be platformed. Either eliminate the comments section or moderate it heavily.
__label__Evidence	agreed but it is far too top heavy with admin and its own obsession with dated attitudes. Not prepared to  use modern comms with patients 
__label__Evidence	Conservative have broken that trust for the general public. Covid was obviously handled terribly but also the attack of set group with policies.  There is no really way to gain respect back after everything.  
__label__Position	which party will do the least harm, as none are really credible
__label__Position	you cant, by reducing hate speech you are eliminating free speech
__label__Position	Hate speech does more harm than good
__label__Evidence	This is the issue that made me most tempted to switch from Labour to Green. I will probably still vote Labour while holding my nose as things currently stand unfortunately.
__label__Evidence	I agree, there is a certain level in which the elimination of hate speech overrules the need for comments
__label__Position	I think there is a difference between expressing differing opinions, and trolling someone. If someone is making a valid alternative viewpoint in a polite and respectful way, that is fine. But if there are simply just insulting or threatening someone else, that is trolling and should be deleted.
__label__Position	Given that hate speech is an illegal and destructive thing (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Detection%20of%20anti-social%20behaviour%20in%20online%20communication%20in%20Arabic) and given that moderation is often opaque and unaccountable (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=The%20New%20Governors:%20The%20People,%20Rules%20and%20Processes%20Governing%20Online%20Speech) I think I'd go back to my original comment and highlight a system focused on transparency, perhaps similar to reddit and/or wikipedia where almost all social interactions are documented and available under a persons username reference, thus allowing for easy accountability either for other readers to review, moderators to ban (or restrict) and police and other legal systems to use as evidence if and when needed.
__label__Position	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__Evidence	Immigration not a big issue for me , media trying to create divisions by promoting it. 
__label__Position	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__Position	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__Evidence	People who are spreading hate speech usually won't care for being educated
__label__Position	Someone should monitor the chat, and those who use hate speech should be given 1 warning before being removed from the website.
__label__Evidence	think those that are still unsure should vote lib dems personally, push tories further out
__label__Evidence	I agree with Andrew. It can also be a form of bullying and those most likely to be affected are the more vulnerable people in society.
__label__Position	I f we reduce usage of contaminating earth stuff eventually the earth will heal itself. The earth is a wonderous thing. Now the problem eventually will not be whether the earth can recover it will be if humans can survive in the toxic atmosphere created by humans. The earth will be here a long time its life that will become extinct. Focus more on not what will happen to the earth but what will happen to life on earth.
__label__Position	Have bots actively scan the comments section, unlike humans who for certain periods, bots can scan all day and act immediately on the flagged post.
__label__Evidence	doesn't discuss free speech - cant limiting free speech lead to hate crimes
__label__Evidence	It would be nice if people could enjoy life aswell as working hard. 
__label__Evidence	I agree, the current government causes all these issues by being a shambles.
__label__Position	There should be ways to monitor the type of language used, perhaps through AI. It should be able to pick up key words related to hate speech.
__label__Position	I do not think it can ever be totally eliminated it will always be there but there can be reporting tools for hate sppech.
__label__Evidence	This is quite possibly the worst excuse to defend the current government. 
__label__Evidence	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control
__label__Position	By ensuring that proper identification and registration information is provided by users, who have to register in order to make comments.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech cannot be tolerated.
__label__Position	I am against removing it entirely, i believe it should be regulated
__label__Evidence	the tory record across the last 14 years has been bad but the labour policies don't seem to be that different from the Tories. Local government is seriously underfunded which means services are being cut along with services and costs are going up
__label__Position	As a student, the cost of living has been the most pressing issue for me. Inflation and the state of the economy then inevitably ties in with that.
__label__Evidence	it allows disagreement while preventing abuse
__label__Position	I agre Brexit is a disaster but no party is going to tackle that. A referendum on rejoining the sngle maRKET? a PRIATE MEMBERS BIL MIGHT DIO IT?
__label__Position	We need to hold websites and social media platforms responsible for hate speech. This is especially important for large platforms with significant influence (e.g., twitter, youtube, facebook).
__label__Evidence	I do not understand comment sections in newspapers., I wish to read the story from the author; having a vox populi of people I don't know serves no purpose to me. I agree with this poster that there are (or could be) other areas where people can place their opinions -if anybody is really interested!
__label__Position	through policy change and legal definitions of hate speech. Online newspapers should not be a space for personal vendettas or cancel culture to decide what people can say but instead a space where the law is upheld .
__label__Evidence	This is a great idea.
__label__Evidence	Reducing freedom of speech is never good and using an algorithm can be helpful, however it opens a whole group of structural problems, when not all hate speech is treated equally. https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/
__label__Position	Good point. If people had to register their real identity, they would be less inclined to engage in hate speech.
__label__Position	freedom of speech is important for people to express their view, but that does not allow hate
__label__Position	We all understand the importance of freedom of speech but hate speech cannot be tolerated and for newspapers to continue using the readers comments section its important that they must have a website bot or person who will be responsible in blocking hate speech comments and ensure that individuals who use hate speech are blocked from ever engaging on their platform.
__label__Position	Make sure that reports of hate speech are actually hateful and not just people being upset with no reason
__label__Evidence	Totally agree. People need to be held accountable for their actions. It sets a standard and builds trust
__label__Evidence	People may take advantage of this.
__label__Position	Our local Tory candidate has been parachuted in and seems to think shouting about bins and potholes on  SM will win him votes..  the quality of Tory canididates is really poor

__label__Position	NHS, Housing Crisis, Cost of Living
__label__Position	I believe it is very unfair to be fed with information that is limited to commenting or having an opinion, maybe a concern form should me signed on the website to bind people from using foul language.
__label__Evidence	Eliminating space for readers in its entirety removes any possibility of stimulating discussion. While hate speech is a serious consideration, I would hope that it forms a small minority of the comments posted on newspaper websites (but I guess this also depends on the topic since some are more charged than others). Surely some form of regulation would suffice to address the severity of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Could lead to more confusion and chaos
__label__Position	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__Position	The key to reducing hate speech without completely eliminating the comment section in news papers is to educate the public on what may qualify as hate specch and therefore ban such in the comment. Great care should also be taken in this matter so as to preserve freedom of speech and expression  but also adhering to the anti hate speech guidelines that have been set.
__label__Evidence	Simply using a word filter would not be enough.  One of the things that makes hate speech so dangerous is that the people saying it know how to get around word filters to say hateful things without using banned words.  Word lists would also trigger false positives and potentially stop constructive discussion about the issue .
__label__Evidence	That's really your biggest concern?
__label__Evidence	eliminating the comment section is more like taking peoples freedoms away as people have the right to freedom of expression
__label__Position	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__Evidence	This is totally untrue.Freedom of speech will exist one way or another and newspapers shoul dbe promotign public views by regulated platforms, so they can be in touch with peoples real thinking and also allow othr people form their own opinions about current issues
__label__Evidence	There already are websites for this and they're often echo chambers that create extremists that eventually shoot up malls.
__label__Position	https://law.stanford.edu/projects/regulating-freedom-of-speech-on-social-media-comparing-the-eu-and-the-u-s-approach/ The blurred dichotomy between what makes a good or bad speech makes it hard to define how a comment section should be moderated. The expected standards in determining a hate comment should consist of whether it is hateful, violent or discriminatory.
__label__Position	I don't really plan on voting
__label__Position	Whilst I am pro keeping comments (with appropriate mods), to look at the arguments against: Removing comment sections allows the focus to be on the article, and if individuals still want to voice their opinion on it, they can still do so on another media platforms which allows the free speech. This 'extra step' may discourage troll users from leaving hate as 1) they are not as visible/cannot make as much of an impact on another platform and 2) interfaces such as Twitter and Facebook have their own moderation techniques.
__label__Evidence	I completely agree, it will help avoid people posting offensive comments and allow the comment section space to be a space of productiveness where we learn what our fellow communities think about articles posted
__label__Evidence	the website could give raise this this awareness and have a open discusion
__label__Position	Most comments that understood the  question seem to agree that filtering comments with hate speech helps reduce hate speech as well as allowing readers to report inappropiate comments which are then reviewed and deleted. One, I didn't know is regulations within countries that require companies to remove hate speech like in Germany, this will be useful in that companies will take the law seriously to avoid fines and penalties.
__label__Position	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__Position	Welfare, the environment & a visceral hatred of selfish people 
__label__Evidence	"Absolutely, vague definitions are the downfall of effective communication. A lot like ""Karen"" replacing the actual words for situations like racist, entitled, rude, emotionally volatile, unreasonable etc. When we all hold a different definition for a word because it's been used too broadly it becomes harder to communicate. Clearly defining what hate speech is with links to the definitions in every format is what could help. People consume information more effectively in different modes like audio, visual, written etc."
__label__Position	Eliminating the comment space for readers seems to be an undemocratic solution that limits freedom of speech - however it remains to be seen whether expressing opinions at the end of article is the best or most affective way of expressing one's true opinions, considering that so many people lie or fake what they contribute to. If the section was to remain, a moderator that looks at the comments before they are approved could be a valid solution, as it would make sure that the comment adheres to certain standards and does not contain violence, racism and sexual content. It is a difficult topic and no matter the choice in the end not everyone is going to be happy.
__label__Evidence	https://www.positivemessengers.net/en/news-en/253-how-to-end-hate-speech-some-good-ideas-that-actually-work.html
__label__Evidence	arg1
__label__Evidence	Having a comment section approver would be costly to the newspaper. Maybe algorithms can be used instead?
__label__Position	One way to reduce hate speech on the platform would be to counter-argue the persons non factual point with actual resource backed up facts. Facts are hard to dispute and bringing in emotion to an argument makes you look bad, whereas showing facts shuts down their opinion while educating them and everyone else in the comment section. Source for this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	By restricting hateful comments and blocking them from the site.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can unfortunetely bean opinion base within this modern world. Being oversentativie to certain comments can pottentially reduce freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I think what you really mean, is that reflects your opinion.  
__label__Evidence	Agree and come to an agrrement of which part should be removed, or find a better way of writing it which does not have any hate speech in it
__label__Evidence	we wait for some progress in new technology to fight climate change.. nothing else will work.. you will NEVER get China or Russia to join EU policy and we will be the only ppl on planet who can not drive a car LOL
__label__Position	Investment into the construction sector. I'm not aware of any party having a strong stance that they will incest heavily (and intelligently). Things like HS2 are a great concept and help the economy, but not if the money is wasted on a non starter
__label__Evidence	"people who support ""hate speech"" laws are the same ones who would have supported the Nazis and Soviet Union ""pravada"" (truth)."
__label__Evidence	Its ok to have some negative comments as long as they are balanced and not offensive or personal
__label__Evidence	send who? where are you getting these figures from lol 
__label__Position	Proportional representation needs a Parliamentary Commission. No need to rush into anything
__label__Evidence	Yes, the welfare of the masses must be well attended to.
__label__Position	Housing stock
__label__Evidence	it would definitely help to reduce hate speech and remove hateful language
__label__Position	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__Position	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct.  There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard.  At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__Evidence	Agree with regulating it
__label__Evidence	Some readers will give their honest response that will assist the writers where to change or improve
__label__Evidence	It may prevent multiples accounts from one user
__label__Position	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__Position	"factors that are merely based on ""scam reports"" or when someone reports an individual for wrong content just by selecting certain options, which are many generalization"
__label__Evidence	Exactly, only tories and reform saying anything realistic and sensible about net zero, but cant vote for Tories this time round 
__label__Evidence	Eliminating the comments section won't stop hate speech: we have to work on the root of the problem
__label__Position	Who will best be able to improve the economy
__label__Position	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__Position	I think the ultimate solution is educating people on hate speech but the newspapers should also not spread the hate speech
__label__Position	Eliminating space for readers is not the solution because most of the time we use the platform to share our experience and knowledge with other readers which might be helpful for other people.a person who use hate speech need to be blocked .
__label__Evidence	In principle a great idea, in practice this requires more money be spent on moderators and system updates
__label__Position	https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/bitstream/handle/1956/17519/How-Platform-Affects-Comments-on-News-Articles.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y
__label__Evidence	Free speech is a thing
__label__Position	getting inflation under control, and the cost of living 
__label__Position	Exactly and we can all learn from each other especially coming from different countries
__label__Position	make sure all people who wish to comment have a genuine log on and have to provide true information so they can be tracked if they use hate speech and face charges.
__label__Position	Ban certain phrases from being used
__label__Evidence	It helps other people contribute their feelings
__label__Evidence	we need to adopt to the current situation , we should not deny that we are responsible for all the problem that we create in accordance with situation
__label__Evidence	The infrastructure is not ready and definitely will not be ready by 2030. EV isn't sustainable, either. 
__label__Evidence	Too many managers, not enough staff, too much waiting around and people not being seen 
__label__Evidence	Im not sure what the poor has to do with it
__label__Position	We should send invitations to all batches of YT and also those who are not selected.
__label__Evidence	Childcare is so expensive now, I don't know how people cope 
__label__Evidence	Im not sure moderation would be the difinitive solution
__label__Evidence	I disagree people need to show what they think about what has been written
__label__Position	the winning party gets 5 years but only about 40% of those who vote back it. mostly conservatives win 3 out 4 of all elections its unfair and most people are not represented in any government
__label__Evidence	Yes it is not a solution because people will no longer discuss the contents of the article, we should keep the comment section open
__label__Evidence	There's nothing wrong with not struggling
__label__Evidence	agree, the comment section is an important tool to exchange your opinion with others
__label__Position	I also think that fully restricting hate speech infringes on the right to freedom of speech, yet fully understand that there is a very thin line that can be crossed with freedom of speech which allows people to fully and unfiltered(ly) express themselves, and hate speech which has waaay more damaging effects
__label__Evidence	On the other hand it also eliminates the chance of reflections or beneficial  interactions within the audience 
__label__Evidence	Realistically this would probably work, but it would no doubt still have problems like people raising issues of 'suppressing free speech' etc.
__label__Position	The only fair way is to remove comments with hate speech/slurs in them. It's either that or remove the comments entirely.
__label__Evidence	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.
__label__Position	No, free speech should be a right despite of the positive/negative approach 
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree they have had long enough now - the whole country needs a fresh start.
__label__Evidence	who recruits these moderators, who chooses their criteria for what is hateful vs what's not?
__label__Position	Yes but according to this article, it shares the view that Newspapers should not be liable or held accountable for peoples views and opinions on comments, it not the views of the Newspaper  https://thegatewayonline.ca/2016/01/newspaper-comment-sections-should-foster-free-speech/
__label__Position	"""How usable should we make historical buildings?"" (Kerry Mashford summarizing chat comments)"
__label__Evidence	On the other hand it also eliminates the chance of reflections or beneficial  interactions within the audience
__label__Evidence	There may be disagreement on what should be included in such programs
__label__Position	Cost of living, NHS, Education and employment
__label__Position	the quality of eductation, including issues such as school funding and teacher pay 
__label__Position	We didn't vote for net zero, and it will cost the country dearly.  Taxation is already very high and I am concerned that it will rise further. particularly taxes like CGT  and IHT.
__label__Evidence	you have a good point. If an algorithm could do that correctly that would be amazing
__label__Evidence	Everyone has a right to free speech
__label__Position	I think I have decided who I will vote for
__label__Evidence	indeed
__label__Position	Hate speech can be moderated in short terms and long term ways, Short term is moderators who moderate what is being posted. Secondly as the ability for readers to flag up inappropriate comments and thirdly delaying the live posts until it has been checked. Long term involves better education at schools
__label__Evidence	Reform have no actionable plans whatsoever and are fuelled by fearmongering
__label__Position	NHS, the cost of living crisis and whether there will be future tax rises
__label__Position	Views on Education, NHS and Housing
__label__Evidence	Totally agree with that, I can see Trump taking advantage
__label__Position	The conduct of the current party (tories)
__label__Position	I don't feel like any of them really know what it is like to live like an average person with the wages, healthcare, ecoconomy etc 
__label__Evidence	I think this is a huge problem and it's not going to go away. Much of our political class is very out of touch, and doesn't seem to want to listen to the people (regardless of political persuasion - I know a lot of politically homeless people both left and right saying they don't feel represented or their concerns listened to). I think the big parties are very bureaucratic right now. 
__label__Evidence	Exactly! It's not true democracy. 
__label__Evidence	Too big a problem to deal with
__label__Evidence	Parties may resist internal reforms
__label__Evidence	Would make less people with no intention of harmful comments interact as they will be fearful of giving out personal data.
__label__Evidence	That is a valid point , but completely removing the comment section is not the best solution for it 
__label__Evidence	The comment section should be a safe where everyone is free to place their opinion and ask question without someone making them feel somehow about themselves.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Position	Readers should be allowed to comment on topics that are available to everyone. We should not reduce freedom of speech we shold develop softwares that are able to detect when hate speech has been written then said comment should be deleted
__label__Evidence	sure what?
__label__Evidence	poorly worded I admit, I meant how those who have immeasurable amounts of money are able to get away without taxation while the rest of us are so harshly punished 
__label__Position	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.
__label__Evidence	Improving the economy can also improve many other sectors 
__label__Position	Although not specific to newspaper websites, this article shows that hate crime online has increased by over 200 incidents just from 2015 to 2018 so if the trend continues it is thought that this may now have increased to over 500 anti-sematism online incidents. https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-11/online_abuse_prevalence_full_24.11.2019_-_formatted_0.pdf
__label__Evidence	I have always voted as I don't really see how you can complain about who is in power if you haven't even bothered to vote
__label__Position	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__Evidence	hate speech can not be given opportunity to thrive and or be heard. it should be removed the moment it is made
__label__Evidence	Potentially reduces correction or dissenting information on the article
__label__Evidence	some people wont like being told what they can and cannot say
__label__Position	COVID party-gate
__label__Position	we can`t have public servises if we don`t pay for them, and you really trust the Tories????
__label__Position	I think this is fair for now, so that people will understand why they can't comment, but in the mean time the newspaper should create an awareness and display on their newspaper and monitor/ delete hate speech from the comments
__label__Position	pretty much agree. ifI lived in Clacton, I'd vote tactically against Farage - don't know who's 2nd thou 
__label__Evidence	This will help the newspaper and community to know which areas affect people the most and help them
__label__Evidence	Although the idea of having AI is quite a good one. How accurate will this AI be in detecting hate speech?
__label__Evidence	Agreed. Beholden to leaders based off the votes of another country, and then leaders of said country tell you you're not even allowed a democratic vote to leave said voluntary union. 
__label__Position	I think I would prefer to see that comments sections are removed rather than untruths being pushed at people.
__label__Position	The government needs to address this issue at its root instead of looking for a bandaid to put over the issue. That means prioritising social welfare and improving the education system because the main reason why there is so much hate speech is because of a lack of education and stress that prevents people from seeing clearly.
__label__Evidence	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts. 
__label__Evidence	Newspapers have a duty of care to the reader so they should be vigilant
__label__Position	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.
__label__Position	before people can comment, they should be required to complete a short survey that can detect their opinions on the issue, then the results would be used to whether allow the person to comment or not
__label__Position	Newspapers are already heavily censored and is not a platform for free speech. Whoever moderates the comments section (be it an algorithm (and by proxy the person creating the algorithm) or a person) will always provide their own bias to the moderation.
__label__Evidence	As long as they are entitled to be here, and can offer a skill we need
__label__Position	By ticking a box to agree not to be abusive or hateful before being allowed to comment
__label__Evidence	Is this a legally binding contract?
__label__Position	I think it is possible to reverse climate change, if we do reverse our consumption habits. Though it will take time. 
__label__Position	I think it is ok to remove the comments. There are other places people can go to express opinions.
__label__Position	taxes, cost of living crisis, support for palestine 
__label__Evidence	A small amount of dairy and eggs is quite sustainable. The author is conflating large scale meat farming with small scale milk and egg production.
__label__Evidence	I agree that the super rich should be taxed more but if taxed to max they will simply move to a lower tax jurisdiction so then you actually have lower tax receipts 
__label__Evidence	This is exactly true.
__label__Position	The newspaper websites should have  AI bots that are able to detect negative comments and strong hate words so they are able to monitor which comments should be posted or not
__label__Evidence	I think that it should be the responsibility of the news outlets to ensure that comments are fair and accurate.
__label__Evidence	I feel like people's wellbeing should be the priority, and those targeted by hate speech might be gravely affected by commenter's words. To me this is more important than people's right to free speech.
__label__Evidence	Agreed.
__label__Position	In recent years, there has been an increase in the amount of hate speech appearing in newspapers and on websites. This has led to calls for action to be taken in order to reduce the amount of hate speech. However, there is a debate about how this can be done without also eliminating space for readers. One proposal is to create a list of words that are considered to be hate speech and to ban these words from being used on newspaper websites. However, this would require newspapers to censor their content and would limit the ability of readers to express themselves freely. Another proposal is to encourage newspapers to moderate their comments sections more carefully. This would involve removing comments that contain hate speech and banning users who repeatedly post such comments. However, this would require a significant amount of resources and may not be feasible for all newspapers. It is clear that reducing the amount of hate speech on newspaper websites is a complex issue.
__label__Evidence	cons
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should have AI that auto flags bad comments
__label__Evidence	This may filter out individuals with valid opinions who just don't feel comfortable without commenting with a degree of anonymitiy
__label__Evidence	Yes, we need proper reforms to tackle corruption and lies in Parliament 
__label__Evidence	Mortgage rates need some taming and yes the cost of living, plus the benefits system 
__label__Evidence	Fully agree!
__label__Position	The main issue for me concerns the party most likely to invest in the economy, trying to invest in housing, transport etc to improve productivity.  
__label__Evidence	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed
__label__Position	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__Evidence	An idea doesn't have to be aggressive to be classed as hate speech. It could be dismissive or belittling, or just downright repugnant. Would you be happy to see Nazi opinions put forward in a happy, smiley way?
__label__Evidence	I think that every platform (websites, socials, etc.) have the responsability to filter and regulate what's happening on their platform.
__label__Evidence	"WHile the definition in general can apply to most types of hate speech, there is one flaw, which can be illustrated by the following statement: ""I don't care about your race, religion or gender. I do not like you because you are an idiot (or stupid)"". Is that hate speech or an expression of opinion?"
__label__Position	I totally agree with this stance. With today's advanced technology, AI can and should be used to detect hate speech, and thereafter filter it out. https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/04/09/how-should-social-media-platforms-combat-misinformation-and-hate-speech/
__label__Evidence	i also agree with lawrenceM as i believe the filters need to be improved and if they arent there,  then they need to be made,
__label__Evidence	It is definitely the way to go. We should not allow hate speech
__label__Position	Create a fourth branch of government focused on future issues and long-term challenges
__label__Position	Improve civic education, especially for young people dkjdfjsdfkslkdf
__label__Evidence	pro 1
__label__Evidence	I agree, sinve Boris Johnson was PM it seems to have become acceptable to lie, and use public office to enrich oneself and one's friends
__label__Position	i am against the removal of the comment section and i believe that regulations and clear rules are the way to go, have systems put into place and enforce the rules. let there be punishable offences for rule breakers.
__label__Evidence	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down. 
__label__Evidence	I dissagree, it should be a safe space for everyone.. people have a right to disagree but not use inflammatory hate speech.
__label__Position	The NHS is probably the biggest, but cost of living crisis and environmental concerns are also hugely important.
__label__Position	the cost of living crisis, having an honest government
__label__Evidence	Skills needed for traditional as well as historic buildings. There have been qualifications in place for 10 years. The Scottish Govt has a retrofit Installer skills Matrix which requires qualifications if you work on an older building - why not in England too? This is basic risk management…  (John Preston)
__label__Position	"""Existing building perhaps even less harmful from carbon view because it is already there, so even if less energy efficient maye be more efficient overall. Where is the cutoff point?"" (Kerry Mashford summarizing chat)"
__label__Evidence	Lack of employment rights and guaranteed pay for those that need it. You're lucky to be in a position where it does not matter as much
__label__Evidence	"In the book ""Noise"" it talks about taking the median for everyones view and making that the regulation. The conversation then becomes which views qualify as each end of this opinion spectrum? Surely not the hateful ones but a modicum of their views so they feel included instead of fuelling their distrust of systems not built for them."
__label__Evidence	Agreed. Government needs to further regulate house purchasing by foreign speculative investors. There should be a hard-cap on the number of properties a person can purchase.
__label__Position	Free speech is not hate speech.  The ability to express an opposing opinion without inciting violence or descrimination should be a basic communication skill that must be met before an opinion is published.
__label__Evidence	But then public opinion would be silenced.
__label__Evidence	"Definately agree, this must change massively.  Earnings, even above national minimum wage are just not giving people enough to enable them to have extra, beyond bills and food costs.  I do feel however that neither Labour nor Conservatives have been very transparent as to where the funding for their ""fixes"" are going to come from so do not trust that either will help bring down the cost of living."
__label__Position	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should  be tasked  with monitoring hate sppech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Evidence	yes, in this way since it will be able to detect hate speech, and readers will still have a chance to news others options, nor to add their thoughts into the account.
__label__Position	Rejoining the EU, investigating the corruption of the last government with contracts like PPE awarded to friends and donors , investing properly in the NHS to undo the drive towards privatisation under 
__label__Evidence	It is actually the legal responsibility of the website not to publish hatespeech.
__label__Evidence	I agree. A big importance for newspapers is the comment section and people's opinion to what they have written. Although, the companies should take some responsibility to monitor the comments and what the other users will see.
__label__Position	No issue has been important to me as I see the selection as a puppet show. The decisions are made elsewhere 
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	By letting the earth heal itself and be left alone. The earth has made it this long and I assume and really think it will make it long after we are gone. There are probably some small things we can do here and there, but for the most part the earth can take care of itself.
__label__Evidence	very important 
__label__Position	I think assertive responses in thee comment section can help with fairly reducing hate speech - allowing everyone the opportunity and right to have an opinion without attacking them and being open to ideas that you may not have considered, or may not personally align to you.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious 
__label__Position	Human populations are approching carrying capacity on planet Earth.Without population control there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of climate cange. 
__label__Position	No, people have the right to express what they thing. But rather than removing access to comments, hate speech should be automatically flagged by the newspaper's website.
__label__Position	Arguments for: hold debates elsewhere https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/25/is-it-really-a-good-idea-to-turn-for-news-websites-to-turn-off-comments
__label__Evidence	Stops the bullying and people feeling bad
__label__Position	they would need to have a moderator or an algorithm that checks the comments for any hate speech and remove or not post it from their page. By deciding to remove the comment section- not only are they infringing on the freedom of speech but they may make people not trust them since they can post any news and no one could correct them
__label__Evidence	I agree. It's also a good way to give a second chance to a person in order for them to change their behavior. And maybe help them understand that they are writing hateful thing, and educating them in a sense.
__label__Position	I think both can work. The general public can report comments that are harmful especially on online platfor ms so that they can be removed and the accounts shadowbanned
__label__Evidence	It is difficult to moderate in a completely unbiased way and it would not be right for moderation to influence opinion.
__label__Evidence	Yes these are the most important things.  
__label__Evidence	Great point about varying perspectives on blockers - one team's blocker might be another team's BaU!
__label__Position	an informed overview about hate speech before anyone can comment so that they can know what to comment and not to comment
__label__Evidence	If journalistss are allowd hteir view and opinion which in many instances can be objecive, public should defientley be allowed to shar theirs, since ournalists are there to promot information and possibly dialogue as well
__label__Position	Taxing corporations and closing loop holes. 
__label__Evidence	Id say the tax bracket could change - the 12,570 has been frozen for years and as a minim wage earner I do struggle myself and if it wasnt for my partner I could not afford living by myself depsite workung 40+ hour weeks in a high technical job (civil engineering) 
__label__Position	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.
__label__Position	In Gentzkow and Shapiro's (2011) study, 55% of the web traffic of the progressive New York Times was from political conservatives. This suggests that the people who are most likely to comment hold strong views, which they may express strongly.
__label__Position	newspaper websites should regulate social media, and hate speech should be tackled by establishing monitoring and evaluation in newsrooms.
__label__Position	there should be words provided in the comment section for a person to use and i those words there should be a mix of good and bad words but the bad ones should no to explicit
__label__Position	Comment sections are meant for social media platforms. The newspaper can post on a platform such as twitter in order to get comments - while disabling comments on their own platform.
__label__Position	Its too much to check every post. But one a person is reported they should be banned if they have been hateful. Its a lot of effort to keep re-registering and should serve as a strong deterrent.
__label__Position	The amount of illegal immigrants in the country, food prices and energy prices.
__label__Evidence	https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea that is a very good read to where to start finding point
__label__Evidence	They should come with warning labels about how crap they are made of.
__label__Evidence	It's not the funding its the inefficiency and waste of money. Why can't you return your crutches when finished with?
__label__Position	The general cost of living also comes into effect.  Food prices which are still rising in some cases, energy costs and transport costs are particularly still a problem for people in  their day to day lives.  Business is also suffering due to energy costs.
__label__Evidence	most immigrants are doctors, lawyers, tax accountants.... the majority of people dependent on welfare are UK citizens who did not pay attention in school. 
__label__Position	read all comments before allowing them to be posted
__label__Evidence	People should be entitled to share opinions.
__label__Evidence	It's time for a change
__label__Evidence	What do you mean by the boats? 
__label__Evidence	Hate speech should still not be given a platform
__label__Position	How can trans rights (bio men) be more important than bio females when talking about womens rights? birthing people? chest feeders? bonus hole? bloody ridiculous
__label__Position	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__Position	Moderation of the comments who remove comments which go against an outlined code of conduct, warnings for accounts posting such comments
__label__Evidence	Agreed - I don't feel represented by any of the parties at the moment, so for me it's a case of choosing the 'least of all evils', and I don't feel comfortable doing that, but at the same time, don't feel comfortable being silent
__label__Position	I think an idea can be given without cussing and there should be a report button if someone is getting aggressive.
__label__Evidence	Allows for testing and refinement of new approaches
__label__Position	Moderation will help maintaining the balance between letting people comment and reducing hate speech
__label__Position	Over population that has a direct effect on other issues such as housing, medical care and jobs
__label__Position	Communication needs to be tailored for different audiences while maintaining core message
__label__Evidence	Comment sections seem rather pointless anyway and are just usually vessels for people to argue. There's social media nowadays to weigh in on your opinion
__label__Position	Need to get a grip on the NHS, migration and the economy. These are my biggest concerns
__label__Position	I believe people should be able to comment but the comments should be monitored
__label__Position	SNP being the only viable option for a Scottish person to vote for. Every other party's communications have focused on stopping another party, which i ffind strange as we're talking about running a country
__label__Evidence	I agree because it will be easy to identify hate speech like this without completely taking away the ability to express opinions
__label__Position	A key issue with many of the suggestions if how you would identify, define and police hate speech. Many suggest online moderators, but these are open to personal bias. Others suggest AI, but this has its own challenges and risks.
__label__Evidence	I definitely agree with what you are saying. I think a lot of hate speech and aggression starts when a user doesn't agree with your opinion and thinking their truth is the only truth.
__label__Position	The same people voting for reform are the same kinds of people who voted BREXIT and ruined the country
__label__Position	The failing infrastructure, and effects of mass migration on low income wages, housing and public services
__label__Position	Moderation is the key to retaining freedom of speech in online spaces without allowing hate speech to be spread. Moderators should be screened beforehand to ensure that they are impartial and capable of identifying and removing forms of hate speech against all groups.
__label__Position	Population and immigration. Corrupt/inept/dangerous leaders.
__label__Evidence	need to have a full time moderator
__label__Evidence	I disagree. Removing the comments section is limiting access to echo chambers, quite literally.
__label__Position	I am for people being allowed to post their opinions in a comment section as long as it is moderated correctly & fairly.
__label__Evidence	As a Scot, I can't agree. Labour is a perfectly good alternative (unless independence is your thing)> One great benefit of voting SNP would be rejoining the EU, though (although Indy is too high a price to pay). 
__label__Position	Here are key ways outlined by a civil rights education page about how to tackle hate speech online https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__Position	I THINK IT WORKS BETTER IF WE COMBINE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE SO THAT WE GET A POSITIVE BALANCE WITHOUT CAUSING ANY INCONVENIENCES.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	my name is rosy and I am here to discuss about key issues in terms of deciding who to vote
__label__Evidence	"But there is a major difference between ""  white people should die"" and ""I have a dislike towards the white race are statistically more"

__label__Evidence	I think the comment sections still need to be a respectful safe place to share your opinions. Free speech can be communicated in respectful way and still get your point/opinion across
__label__Position	Just pay moderators
__label__Evidence	I also agree because reading what people thinks about your work or your outlet is important. if not then how could the writer improve?
__label__Position	Education is a big part of it for me. The lack of teachers, the lack of funding. I have a primary school aged child whose struggling and needs more support, so a party who are supporting education is important to me
__label__Evidence	i agree with this, for there to be a clear definition before you post, not terms or rules in small writing
__label__Position	The comment section should not be removed because it is  a way of communicating with the public. Rather they must be rules to regulate people's comments.https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/25/is-it-really-a-good-idea-to-turn-for-news-websites-to-turn-off-comments
__label__Evidence	Its just pure greed and our government are allowing it.  
__label__Position	I agree it is going to need a world effort to combat climate change. Not just a few rich countries trying to. 
__label__Evidence	I agree completely. People need to be educated
__label__Position	No one is going to give significant personal data or information, or if they do it will false information. I think all comments should be moderated all the time, and posts removed if they contain harmful or damaging content.
__label__Position	There is no easy answer when it comes to hate speech. While it is clearly a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be. That said, it is worth exploring different options to see what might work best. Perhaps a combination of education and enforcement could be most effective in reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	The question assumes that we CAN fairly reduce hate (or any other) genre of speech when this generally has been shown to be impossible without heavy moderation and/or dramatically impacting interaction, as evidenced by any major social media platform I can think of. Algorithms used in places like wikipedia, twitter and reddit are probably an effective and fairly simple option, where a combination of akismet style selection and a robust anaylsis and transparency are available to see if and when someones history has bias.
__label__Position	Jail time for those that have commited fraud, we go to prison, they pay a paltry fine and mumble sorry
__label__Position	conduct more research on it
__label__Evidence	Right, because the Tories can be trusted with your money... 
__label__Position	My position on the topic still remains to rather find ways to reduce or even eliminate only the hate speech, instead of no speech at all.  I find it interesting to read other people's opinions on different types of topics and I usually learn a lot.
__label__Evidence	I agree - but how do we do it whilst giving readers some protection?
__label__Evidence	Hate comments can manifest into something much worse and is absolutely neccesary to destroy the source of the hate.
__label__Position	I agree with Emily, that perhaps we could all benefit from stepping back a little from the virtual world. The internet does tend to create pockets of like-minded people to air their extreme views with anonymity and this can become dangerous, as we ahve seen with groups such an Incels.
__label__Position	violence against women and girls
__label__Evidence	You're trusting an algorithm that would need to be trained by humans - so the AI itself could still be biased.
__label__Evidence	I like this idea as it contains inbuilt responsibility, so it motivates the people in power to fix it, and competition between different newspapers will breed more effective methods to reduce hate speech effectively, which other platforms will copy and adapt
__label__Evidence	Population is the main cause  Increase in Population spoils the country  Lifestyle also needs to be changed according to the nature 
__label__Evidence	By removing the comment section will entice further hate speech on another platform. Rather allow people to give their opinion and block comments that relate to hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Most, if not all, politicians are in this for themselves. It's a career choice.

__label__Evidence	all spot on 
__label__Evidence	It cannot be the  number one priority for developing countries and people that are struggling with poverty. They are the people contributing less to climate change, and often pay more consequences for it. Priority to act should be ordered by our responsibility in the disaster!
__label__Position	you can make a screening in the background to control the context and also the comment section as everyone is allowed to their own opinion but not that aggresive in public
__label__Evidence	However, I tend to agree with this opinion: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php . I don't think hate speech will end with the end of anonymity. We have to think about the possibilities of safety for human rights activists that only come with anonimity.
__label__Evidence	it allows people to interact and share their opinion on the subject.
__label__Position	I need to brush up on the manifasto for each party today!  It's just a shame there isn't a strong contender. I a
__label__Position	I do not believe that removing the comment space is the answer. I feel a moderator would be a useful way of eliminating hate speech but still enabling people to have their say.
__label__Evidence	Yes, and to do that those of us who are reasonably well off need to recognise that we need to make sacrifices. Just like a set of scales, to level up some areas others may have to level down. 
__label__Evidence	also most newspapers stories are also posted online and out there forever on the internet.
__label__Evidence	Right to free speech isn't necessarily a right to a platform or a publisher. Before the internet, people weren't entitled to have their comments on the news stapled inside a copy of the paper. They were just able to express their opinions on it independently, to family or coworkers, or by writing their own publication in response. I'm not sure if newspapers simply choosing not to publish readers' comments (which is what they are doing by hosting those comments on their site) is the same as censoring free speech. By this logic, anyone who writes a poorly written opinion piece and submits it to the New York Times should get it published, because otherwise their speech is oppressed.
__label__Evidence	You're totaly right.  the problem is the power of consumption over our minds. I see the appeal it has on children. To fight against it, we must extract ourselves from the big market and the advertising that accompanies it
__label__Position	we can get a team of comment readers to proof read every comment and delete the hateful ones, because I don't think every comment is a hate speech.
__label__Position	Inconsistent application of planning policy and conservation guidance means that improvement proposals meet with widely different and unpredictable responses in addition to delays caused by the strained planning system.
__label__Position	The NHS is also important to me
__label__Evidence	Because some peoples opinions can be hurtful to others
__label__Position	Most people there have no idea what freedom really is : you are all socialist, you all wants to control what people do or think by putting walls everywhere. You are the root of totalitarism.
__label__Evidence	I disagree, comments are how valid opinions are spread and change is made in the world. If there are no comments, there's no feedback.
__label__Position	If we learned something from other platforms, it's impossible to completely manage the hate speech, and to reduce the hate speech without affecting free-speech we need to target the audience
__label__Evidence	100%, and I would like my daughter to have a planet left to enjoy. I think also massive renewable energy infrastructure programmes are likely to help the economy and do our bit for climate change, but the government have been VERY hands off here, compared to e.g. Nordic countries or Germany. There's ways of supporting both. 
__label__Position	I don't think this can be done, if there is space for comments there will always be people who want to abuse it
__label__Evidence	Agreed, we don't want tax increasing. NHS could do with some work too. Even pensions are getting taxed ?!?!
__label__Position	Funding in the NHS is another key issue
__label__Evidence	i dont think its possible to weigh hate speech. different peech hits differently to different people
__label__Position	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Position	In reflection of everyone's opinion on this matter, I still believe it is important for people to be able to share their views. There are many solutions that can be explored and implemented to at least reduce, if not eliminate hate speech commentary. The pro to removing comment space is complete elimination or reduction of the hate speech phenomenon but it would infringe on the basic right to free speech. Algorithms to filter and education policies to teach people about the impact of their opinions are some of the ways we can begin to tackle the issue before taking extreme measures.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it can be very challenging. But what good is it to just give up. We have to at least try to make change, no matter how hard it can be. We just have to learn how to make the right types of changes.
__label__Position	We should probably tax the obscenely wealthy more, if not at least close some of the sneaky loopholes that they take advantage of to avoid tax 
__label__Position	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__Position	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__Evidence	Anonymity empowers people and might make them more willing to express extreme opinions. Verified profiles reduces anonymity.
__label__Evidence	This is a good idea, as it eliminates the need for a moderator to sift through every single comment but rather they only need to look through comments that have triggered the bot. Then, they can make a decision on whether it has truly conveyed hate speech or whether (less likely scenario) there is human/bot error in the process
__label__Position	A possible con with allowing comments is that it will attract a people with similar views and opinions, leading to an echo chamber. This can be seen in many other social media forums such as Facebook groups, niche Subreddits, etc. Where there can be an almost elitist hierarchy and a lot of gatekeeping. Being the only person with a different view could cause people to leave/stop commenting, leaving only the people who share the same views.
__label__Position	I think it is necessary to keep the comments sections open and not to discourage genuine people from posting their views. It is however necessary to block completely destructive comments.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	Removing hate speech comments is the solution to go to, if you attacked me then you didn't respect my freedom.
__label__Evidence	I don't agree with handing over a lot of personal data as this could be misused and seems like an overstep of personal freedoms and privacy
__label__Evidence	yes we need to be able to express our opinions
__label__Position	https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/what-happened-after-7-news-sites-got-rid-of-reader-comments/
__label__Position	I just want to feel hopeful for a change. it feels as if we've been on a downward trajectory for so long. 
__label__Position	Being fair as to reduce hate comments and allow the readers to engage with what's being communicated to them, introducing words filters and censors will work perfectly. See below:  https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CAQQw7AJahcKEwiIqLLkm-_6AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Frm.coe.int%2Fstarting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online%2F16809c85ea&psig=AOvVaw27EvyEVPkE-0xNg9nVZtKL&ust=1666369217616059
__label__Evidence	If comments are really harmful towards certain groups of people I would rather that the provider cuts them off.
__label__Evidence	not democratic
__label__Evidence	We are out - its one - do it properly now
__label__Evidence	I agree that some regulation and introduction of the standards of communication is necessary to allow for maintaining comment space open for everybody.
__label__Position	once news is exposed to the internet, everyone has access to it, and right to comment any how they feel about the news, but hate speech, so an AI that can detect hate speech should be introduce, in that way it will eliminate hate speech not the space for readers comment section
__label__Position	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__Evidence	The problem is hate speech really means political speech. It's a way of silencing dissent of political agendas that are transforming certain countries societies in a way people don't like.
__label__Evidence	I agree with you
__label__Position	The root cause of most issues is likely from a select few, root out the troublemakers and ban accordingly.
__label__Evidence	that is true the developers hate to filter, using mods and bots to detect the hate speech
__label__Position	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__Position	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__Evidence	this outs a limit on free speech
__label__Evidence	things can only get better!
__label__Evidence	"I think it's a little more nuanced than curtailing freedom of speech. If we define the right to free speech as ""the right to speak, write, and share ideas and opinions without facing punishment from the government"", you have to consider that news websites and social media are not moderated by the government or required to allow freedom of speech.  If a news website is to be truly impartial, I don't personally believe that opinions of the layman provide any benefit and can often be harmful.  That however, is only my opinion ;)"
__label__Position	Whether or not it is a hoax, human having rational thinking he have the guilty when he affect the environment with pollution like fumes, industrial wastes and other things damaging the society. 
__label__Evidence	By making rules we might lose some viewers.
__label__Position	We need to ensure fair prices for farmers  products
__label__Evidence	Moderators need to act quickly to remove any hate speech
__label__Position	Hate crimes have significantly increased in the past 10 years from 40K to 110K, with the increase in communication but the education has not been able to keep up. Newspapers have the duty to educate and help reduce crime.
__label__Position	Whilst free speech should be allowed, social media companies have a responsibility to remove hate speech and to stop hate speech from being posted online, this can be via AI tools and algorithms that are designed to pickup on information posted that falls under the category of hate speech. Posts should be pre-checked first to confirm that they they don't fall under the banner of hate speech whilst still allowing users to express their opinions on a wide variety of topics. Also the newspapers have a duty not to inflame the situation further with their website articles as this is more likely to elicit a response from users that could be considered hate speech as users are more likely to respond to controversial articles and this could be seen as encouraging users to post hate speech.
__label__Position	I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__Evidence	I don't think we will ever fully get rid of hate speech on these platforms unfortunately however more close monitoring could decrease it, as well as sanctions for those who write the hate speech.
__label__Position	The comment section can be monitored and any comments that have hate speech should be censored.
__label__Evidence	This would reduce the risk of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Personally I like to read other peoples' comments, it can offer an alternative view to the first comment being made and it opens your mind to accepting other views.
__label__Evidence	green energy is generally good but its very expensive and unreliable
__label__Position	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not. If you don't like free speech then go live in China.

__label__Evidence	Technology can help. Planting trees can also help but isn't the single solution. We need to simultaneously adopt many strategies and methods to fight climate change. 
__label__Position	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__Evidence	But people who engage in hate speech probably wouldn't take any notice.
__label__Evidence	I agree that we, as humans, can adapt to the situation as best as possible. But we can also take small steps towards change. The situation doesn't have to be impossible.
__label__Evidence	Very true. London is the focus of the main parties. PV system would change that. 
__label__Evidence	I think this would benefit a lot of people 
__label__Position	You can moderate and that way delete hate speech. This won't get rid of freedom of speech but gets rid of discrimination etc https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Evidence	These are not mutually exclusive, and sensitive decarbonisation proposals should meet with planning support. Planning is a balance.
__label__Position	health
__label__Evidence	I disagree - people should comment where it is appropriate but not on topics where the public is largely misinformed or can spread misinformation such as climate change. Comments on topics like celebrities are ok because they ultimately don't matter when compared to an important science-policy debate.
__label__Evidence	I've found the same, whereas our Labour MP lives here, his kids go to school here, and he really shows up in the community 
__label__Evidence	Agreed people may be highly less likely to post negative comments if they had their true identity in display!
__label__Position	Another study that I found against the removal of comment sections can be found here: https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__Position	climate change is in our future we must care for all
__label__Evidence	People constantly find their way around word filters and more often than not it filters a lot of genuine non hate comments too.
__label__Position	Simplify EU websites and communication
__label__Position	More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users
__label__Position	I don't believe that we can reverse the climate change that we have already done at this point, because we're too far gone. That said, I think that we do have the ability to at least slow it down or change the current course as to not do any more damage.
__label__Position	I don't agree, people are entitled to have their voices heard
__label__Position	Report button on every comment so that people can report hate speech from other users. This would require an actual person or software to evaluate the reported comments
__label__Position	I am against hate speech. But I do not think the right answer is to completely disregard the comment section. It's important to maintain freedom of speech and readers should be able to express their opinions about what is written
__label__Evidence	i agree
__label__Evidence	As technology becomes more advanced, there are algorithms that detect hate speech, for example on Twitter. People can also report hateful comments so that only appropiate comments are left.
__label__Evidence	covering both sides is great but we should be able to be respectful towards eachother
__label__Evidence	Censorhip feeld liek democraic values of freedom are abolished nad can lead to precedent of media muffling public opinion as they deem fit
__label__Evidence	Perhaps this would put too much power in the hands of arbiters. But if those who partake in submitting 'hate' comments were to be traced, they should end up in the Courts, not be 'educated'.
__label__Position	regulations and setting values is the most paramount phase to consider when planning to eliminate hate speech from newspapers websites which clearly state that should anyone go beyond these rules will then be held accountable .
__label__Position	Comment sections should be moderated for hate speech with specific guidelines on what constitutes this. Disagreement, or otherwise uncivil comments should still be permitted.
__label__Evidence	Comment sections have become so ingrained in the news website experience that their removal will at first seem almost an affront to free speech.
__label__Position	Yes go after non-doms and other tax evaders. Enable those billionaires who WANT to pay more taz to do so voluntarily
__label__Evidence	If we identify the negative feedback loops and break them, then we have a chance of slowing or even reversing climate change
__label__Evidence	https://www.dw.com/en/turkey-introduces-jail-terms-for-disinformation/a-63435062 Here is an example of a news article, which highlights the potential dangers/misuse of personal datas provided to social media and news sites. Although this is not a UK based news item, it is an example of how information can be mis-used.
__label__Evidence	I don't think people will vote with any enthusiasm for Labour and will regret in the years to come when taxes inevitably go up
__label__Position	I see a lot of opinions on here that newspaper websites are not responsible to 'police' their platform and that free speech should be allowed. In many parts of the world hate speech and racism are not protected by freedom of speech laws. While I do agree that newspaper websites should allow free discussion and different opinions on their platforms, this does not mean they have to allow hate speech and discriminatory language.
__label__Evidence	Social media promotes unrealistic beauty standards and can harm self-esteem
__label__Evidence	If people aren’t made aware of issues relating to hate speech, there may not be enough awareness to create a change
__label__Evidence	it would be a less divisive place
__label__Evidence	I don't agree with arguments that removing comment sections is an attack on free speech. People have multiple platforms where they can give their opinions (social media, emails, forums, conversations etc.). Newspapers aren't required to provide yet another place for people to converse.
__label__Position	I would like to see utilities re nationalised the cost of heating our homes is ridiculous
__label__Position	do we use blockchain tech or not
__label__Position	having a team that monitors people with hate speech might be a great idea however it might not be effective since the number of users can be unknown
__label__Evidence	People will say whatever they want even mean things and say it is free speech.People should learn to be kind to others without using free speech as an excuse
__label__Evidence	I think that having these echo chambers just perpetuates what may be a cognitive dissonance, you may not necessarily feel a certain way but a comment you put out may have be interpreted one way and subsequent comments would reinforce that viewpoint in a polarised echo chamber. This website explains it nicely and uses racisms as an example of how cognitive dissonance perpetuates racist behaviour. https://www.reallifepsych.com/single-post/2017/08/16/the-psychology-of-cognitive-dissonance-and-racism
__label__Evidence	Too much money is spent on mental health as it is 
__label__Position	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__Position	housing, education, the arts, human rights
__label__Position	The main idea would be to create a community that self-regulates itself, in addition to investing in a good IA that identifies hateful comments and the extreme solution would be to only allow accounts registered for more than 1 month (example) to comment
__label__Evidence	There are those that are going to use the paltform to
__label__Evidence	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.
__label__Evidence	comments can be moderated and removed
__label__Evidence	this is an efficient and cost-effective measure
__label__Position	Flag up hate comments.
__label__Position	We need to get rid of waiting lists not just reduce them. Other countries have managed this.
__label__Position	I think there should be a comment section so that writers know what the readers like and dislike but hate speech should be fully eliminated and any users using hate speech should be blocked for a period of time.
__label__Evidence	Taxpayers will have to pay
__label__Position	The NHS and healthcare as well as tax
__label__Evidence	But comments should be sorted to prevent hate speech
__label__Evidence	a total media distraction from the far far bigger issues in the country on NHS, housing, roads, education. people get sucked into the nigel farage / priti patel nonsense that this is a huge issue when it isnt.  
__label__Evidence	This could hurt many people who will be affected by negative comments
__label__Evidence	The cost of living is a big factor. The existing government has failed to stop the profiteering by coorporations and private entities, especially in the energy sector. Lives are being devastated by profiteering.  
__label__Evidence	"""Deserve a chance"" - are you trolling? They've had 14 years of a chance."
__label__Position	Positions on economy and healthcare
__label__Position	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.
__label__Position	Immigration does really need to be under strict control. The rwanda approach has cost alot of money but has so far not acheived anything. 
__label__Position	The use of a system that detect hate speech before publishing
__label__Evidence	I am not sure collecting data about the person before posting will help with tracing them down and trying to re-educate them. Just blocking the post and providing a response to them saying their post is not accepted by the platform is more appropriate.
__label__Position	Cost of living and NHS
__label__Evidence	I agree, hate speech needs to be dealt with from the root of the problem, it is not the responsibility of news services to police this.
__label__Position	I think that there are so many different facets of life that have deteriorated for a long time now, and I do fear that we are in big trouble.
__label__Evidence	Reduction of hateful and harmful speech
__label__Evidence	This is a good idea, people might not even realize what can be classed as hateful if they've never experienced it before.
__label__Evidence	"But ""personal liberty"" can't be absolute: one person's liberty should not force another person into hiding. Also, the whole ""state control"" meme seems to be disingenous: in times of great crisis the state not only may but MUST intervene for the safety and security of all. That is the core reason for the state to exist."
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is called hate speech for a reason. ALso it is not protected under the guise of freedom of speech. Not forgetting that with every right theres subsequent responsibilities
__label__Evidence	I think squeezing the short-term NHS funding has meant more long-term health issues for a lot of people
__label__Evidence	Scotland is desperate for immigrants. Our NHS is suffering because of the lack of immigration.
__label__Position	There will be a right to digital identity and access to deliberative tools
__label__Position	My views on this have not changed. A moderated comments section with a flagging system is still a good way of allowing discussion while limiting hate speech.
__label__Evidence	What works for Islington may not work across the country. Conservation policy work has always been constrained by lack of resources. It must be 30 years since we were trying to get govt to require Local Authorities to carry out Conservation Area Appraisals and keep them up to date. (John Preston)
__label__Evidence	Hardly the most important issue just now
__label__Evidence	but what if users arent using their real information, how can the goverment implement it then?
__label__Evidence	I agree in maybe censoring certain words but having moderators doesn't site well with me at all - it's getting to the point where only woke views are allowed to be expressed.
__label__Position	Policy makers have vested interests with industry to ignore signals of overshoot and straining risks. Whatever action will be taken too late and there is no way to prevent feedback loops 
__label__Evidence	no opportunity to discuss topics
__label__Evidence	I think it's difficult to re-educate (so to speak) someone engaging in Hate Speech because the root cause is something within themselves. Unless a newspaper website wanted to fund a dedicated team to address and re-program the life long beliefs and internalised trauma that some racists, homophobes etc hold, then it seems an insurmountable task. The key would be to start at the ground floor and provide affordable therapy, mandatory counselling for offenders, pump more money into diversifying and fortifying the education system...
__label__Evidence	I agree with this. With that being said, we as consumers need to demand more from the same organizations. We need to go to all levels of government and demand that these same organizations give us alternatives in the form of electric and hydro cars while also proving that we are ready to purchase them to give these same organizations incentive to play along.  
__label__Evidence	I don't think the intention is to be aggressive but sometimes expressing yourself may lead to saying things that hurt other people.
__label__Position	If comments are to be allowed then as AliceW states, they shouldn't be tampered with or diluted otherwise what is the point or having comments at all?
__label__Position	this is not possible, this will result in censorship.
__label__Evidence	this day hard to find doctor appointment specificly dentits
__label__Position	checking the comments before allow the user to post it
__label__Evidence	I agree, not anywhere near enough new housing to cope with demand
__label__Position	How is hate speech differentiated from freedom of speech? Who defines this and how is it controlled?
__label__Evidence	I completely agree. It's not the job of online sites to become speech police. I frequent many different online comment sections, and oddly enough, hateful comments are swiftly dealt with by other contributors. Sometimes the best way to eliminate hate speech, is to allow it to be seen, then vastly condemned by those seeing it.  Algorithms should be used to deal with trolling. Honest, sometimes brutal comments should not censored just because they make others uncomfortable.
__label__Evidence	That said, I'd agree that everyone should be able to express their opinions.....as long as they are public and the accounts are transparent, without the users hiding behind anonymous accounts. If they do that, then consequences can occur.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I would fall into the voting category as a tactical voter.
__label__Evidence	NHS funding is not keeping up with an ageing and growing population.
__label__Position	Monitor comments (using technology)and block users that leave such comments
__label__Evidence	This would surely reduce discussion. People should be free to contribute without having to give up their privacy.
__label__Position	I found this article:https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/14/meet-guardian-best-below-the-line-commenters
__label__Evidence	Good use of removal
__label__Evidence	I don't think that's true anymore - working in a large corporation, 5 years ago, we would have never talked about sustainability, been willing to pay more for anything sustainable, or frankly, really been concerned. Now, we have no real choice - consumers are simply demanding it.
__label__Position	I want to see immigration curbed and the Rwanda policy carried out.
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree, but guidance on acceptability and respect is often needed
__label__Position	"I don't think any attempts should be made to block or censor anything. Yes I,m Gen X, yes I gre up with the old adage ""sticks and stones make break my bones but words will never touch me"" . It aint true, but its a good way to live your life."
__label__Evidence	not well explained
__label__Position	How long does this go on for?
__label__Position	By having companies employing skilled and trained moderators.
__label__Evidence	They get treated well already
__label__Position	I believe in democracy, equality and freedom of speech. However I do not believe in hate speech therefore I believe that newspaper websites should keep to the original essence of the newspaper and not a comment section, as other newspaper websites with comment section seem to spread fake news. I think that since we live in a social media world, hence newspaper websites can post their articles on them so that people can share their views on the article.
__label__Evidence	My husband and I want to start a family and the thought of nursery costs and childcare is scary! We have no family nearby that would be able to watch them so it's looking likely that I'll be giving up work!  
__label__Evidence	I find your view hateful.
__label__Evidence	Tailoring messages too much can lead to bland or overly triggering communication
__label__Evidence	https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/juraba52&div=30&id=&page=
__label__Position	NHS, redistributing wealth
__label__Evidence	AI helps with giving you information on important things about life that can be conveniently accessed through the internet for free with less effort
__label__Position	sorry but we all have an opinion which we are allowed to express but we should also be respectful of others opinions,we should not actively give out hurtful words!
__label__Position	"some people ""troll"" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion. Any attempts at calling something ""hate speech"" will be only about stopping anything that goes against the narratives of the rich establishment."
__label__Position	Diversity is important so that all sides are heard
__label__Position	The incompetence of the Tory government, and the way it has consistently enriched its already-wealthy friends, while leaving the 
__label__Evidence	I think that is more to do with external factors than the Conservatives
__label__Position	I agree with the point of view that there should be a broad spectrum of moderators to stop any particular biased opinion or agenda from controlling the comments.
__label__Position	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__Position	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__Position	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__Position	Tory record, economy, services, local government
__label__Position	After going through all the other comments ,my opinion on the topic has not changed. Newspaper Websites are where people should get the news from ONLY, not write their opinions. They can go express their opinion else where about what they have read , not on the website.
__label__Evidence	you ewill care when they take away your car from you .. or make it insanly expensive to fly ..  
__label__Position	I personally think hate speech shouldnt be reduced, althou it is hate and can hurt some people, it is those types of comments that makes you stronger at the end and learn how to ignore ignorend stupid blabber mouth people.
__label__Evidence	I've seen it work well, but the algorithm needs to be somewhat transparent
__label__Evidence	Tougher sentencing is needed, too. 
__label__Position	Tory cronyism, NHS, Cost of Living, Climate Change etc.
__label__Evidence	Agree, as you can read here > https://accessiblelaw.untdallas.edu/limits-free-speech-social-media
__label__Evidence	i agree, freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences and those who peddle hate speech should be punished
__label__Position	The inequalities of the UK. The running down of public services. The lack of cohesion from the present government
__label__Evidence	definately comments section should be monitored before it gets out to the public
__label__Evidence	No room for intelligent discussion
__label__Position	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__Evidence	There is enough negativity in this world at the moment without adding to it with hate speech!
__label__Evidence	This really need to be addressed, however i thin there are too many big lobbyists. IF we have oil and gas we should do what norway does and have a sovereign fund.  Then you see idiots like the one to the left 'i love my diesel engine', you may well do, but people love there kids and their countries, more important
__label__Position	I think that removing readers comments will never deal with the problem of hate. The readers comments section is a valuable area which allows people to debate opinions. The only way to reduce hate speech is by educating future generations, telling them that differences in society are valuable. Disabling comments simply censors people and that can never be a good thing.
__label__Evidence	That sounds good because then people know they will be held accountable for their comments.
__label__Evidence	but it discredit the news paper
__label__Evidence	I have to say, this is my thoughts. I feel there is already too much of this going on, so the media oliagarchs can direct things politically.
__label__Position	I'd like there to be an option to vote for the person who will do the best for my constituency rather  than a party. There are good and bad ppolictioan in all parties
__label__Evidence	problem is, it's not children doing it, its people past general education and often adverse to adult learning full stop
__label__Position	Develop a software that will not allow posting of any hate speech
__label__Position	NHS & dentistry, cost of living, public services
__label__Position	Just getting the tories out and actually getting the change this country so badly needs
__label__Position	Some awareness is now spreading among the people. It should be expanded. Each and everyone must talk about this, everyone's responsibility in climate change. We all should stop avoiding plastics and co2 emissions. Every child must teach this in school. We need a kids should aware like Greta Thunberg.
__label__Evidence	By opening a comment section and allowing anyone to express themselves there, holding the newspaper's website accountable for someone's comment seems a bit too much.
__label__Evidence	Different perspectives on blockers exist as usually they were once useful and are no longer contemporary. How can we get better at continuous review and improvement so that there are fewer blockers?
__label__Evidence	I completely agree. They are all just the same as each other.
__label__Position	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__Evidence	Agreed
__label__Position	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__Position	I agree Universal Credit is such a trap 
__label__Evidence	Very funny.
__label__Evidence	True, in detail without being disrespectful or bullying
__label__Position	We can provide spaces for each person to write without them mingling and arguments starting over someones opinion.
__label__Evidence	yes, I agree, need moderators,
__label__Evidence	I agree but in reality, it is hard to carry out. It would require newspapers to work with law enforcement and there may be legal issues with the sharing of people's personal data. You also run the risk of this data being stolen or sold to groups or governments that should not be trusted with such data.
__label__Position	The comment section would need to be monitored, and other readers should be able to report comments
__label__Position	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__Evidence	how will that work?
__label__Evidence	we should be helping people to flee war torn countries rather than them risking their lives for hopes of survival 
__label__Evidence	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts! 
__label__Evidence	racism all over the world has become sickening thanks to lying politicians 
__label__Position	The comments could be checked for hateful speech. For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.
__label__Position	"I found this really interesting, ""Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend."" This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)"
__label__Evidence	For England? Sure.
__label__Position	Everyone is free to talk in the way ji/ze likes
