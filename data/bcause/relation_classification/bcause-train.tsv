__label__Attack	one persons free speech is another persons hate speech	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Seems to involved and complicated for most to even want to try.	If we identify the negative feedback loops and break them, then we have a chance of slowing or even reversing climate change
__label__Support	True but having set standards could help reduce it effectively because freedom of speech also comes with responsibility.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__Support	Having laws in place should ensure that hate speech is discouraged or punished	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up

__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?

__label__Attack	You may argue that it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police their comment sections. Having said that, perhaps the relevant question you should be asking is whether it is in their best interests to do so. That is, even if it's not their moral obligation, it may STILL be in their financial and functional best interest to do so. The prevalence and salience of hate speech may signal to audiences that the newspaper tolerates (at best) and endorses (at worst) the hateful commentary appearing in their comment section. How do you think this would impact the bottom-line of the bottom line of said newspaper company? I would argue: Not well. And how do you think this would impact the ability of said newspaper to reach future audiences? I would argue: Not well. Individuals disgusted by the appearance of hate speech may be at an increased probability of avoiding said newspaper website in the future on moral grounds. Consider, for example, individuals who boycott Nestle for ethical reasons.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__Attack	However, I tend to agree with this opinion: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php . I don't think hate speech will end with the end of anonymity. We have to think about the possibilities of safety for human rights activists that only come with anonimity.

__label__Support	I definitely agree with this. The website itself should take some responsibility as to what appears on the site. Offensive behaviour should not be permitted.	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__Attack	What if the moderators are biased themselves?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I think having the viewer agree to use respectful language before they are taken to the comment section could have some minor benefits.	By not providing comment section not unless the article need their opinion. There'll be a note notifying readers to be well mannered.
__label__Support	i think so too, there must be software to instyruct an algorhythm to pick out certain hate words and delete the comment	Have monitoring software be used.

__label__Support	Stops the bullying and people feeling bad	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy

__label__Support	I don't believe the comments section should be removed as everyone is entitled to a voice	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship.  I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it.  Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.  Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy.  They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__Attack	However, by doing that you may be limiting people's ability to express themselves positively too	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__Attack	The requirement of a phone number is a reasonable one, but might restrict participation (i.e. there will be people who are unable or unwilling to give their phone number just to comment on a newspaper website). An alternative approach could be to enforce a 'waiting time' from account creation to the ability to post comments? This would prevent repeat offenders from simply creating new accounts after they were banned	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments, banning repeating offenders and requiring a phone number to create a account.

I agree it is a gigantic problem that needs to be met with urgency and importance by all of us. I don't know that we could reverse climate change, it seems most damage has been done, but I'm hopeful taking stronger actions now would at least help reverse some things, and prevent current issues from developing further. It's worth trying.
__label__Attack	It's a good idea, but too many get giddy at trying to break rules and in doing so, ruin things.	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__Support	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.	In order to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. Active communinty management and moderation is required. This helps keep people in line with the community guildelines.

__label__Attack	I think people are so wary of giving personal information out online that this would put people off commenting and while this might deter 'keyboard warriors' who are happy to hide behind a screen I dont think it would be helpful to have the threat of being tracked down.

__label__Support	I think that this is correct but mst places have a law or legal guideline as to what it considered hatespeech n that country	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__Support	I agree as many news papers in our days don't have comment sections as it is expensive and time consuming	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I think people may give false information (data)	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Costs money... 	Trust and integrity is vital
__label__Attack	This may negatively impact the public. As newspapers may publish news in a manner deceiving the truth and those who are not aware would believe lies.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Very funny.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I agree! 	I think the lazy brits that sit on their backsides, smoking/vaping and watching Sky tv should get off their backsides and fill these jobs - stop giving them money for doing nothing 
__label__Support	Yes -  utilisation of private healthcare is the only logical way to cut waiting times. 	So who will it be when the votes are collected? 
__label__Support	I have to agree with that take, I feel like it could be quite dangerous for UK to get closely involved, do not need a war.	I am not sure who is responsible for enforcing the legislation?
__label__Attack	but AI is still weak right now to filter hate speech comments efficiently	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__Support	agree, 14 years of government and theyve wrecked the quality of life for many people at the benefit of others	This software has stopped working for me
__label__Attack	We are out - its one - do it properly now	Economy, NHS, immigration and inflation.
__label__Support	Having rules will make online engagement respectful.	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__Attack	If facts are given sources should be used to back this up.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Support	makes the comments more welcoming to everyone	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__Support	What about it? more money for education? change the curriculum?  	They've both had a chance to prove themselves - they've both had a chance to show consistency over policies. Neither have. 
__label__Attack	The dangers of allowing free speech has been constantly seen in different moments. A recent time was when Donald Trump Instigated riots in America, causing damage to buildings and applauding it... making it worse and worse	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Would make less people with no intention of harmful comments interact as they will be fearful of giving out personal data.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Attack	I've heard this idea of safe routes for migrants. Britain is an island so literally the only way to get here is by boat.	Also a lot of waste
__label__Attack	This is like saying if there are less weeds in the garden there is less work. The weeds grow. We have to address the weeds.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	There are some good points however in having news sites require users to submit data they risk each users' privacy and right to anonymity. This could be increadibly dangerous and would encourage people to stop using the site	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	Agreed, but social housing has to be just as important because house prices for 1st timers will continue to rise if there's still a shortage. 	You are conflating two issues , enviromnet and climate change
__label__Attack	yeah they can, but certain AI can be added on newspapers websites to detect and remove hate speech.	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__Attack	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Support	glad the numbers are low. also you have to blame the voters for not doing their research and supporting idiots 	It's lack of investment in training. We can't keep letting our country poach other people's trained doctors and nurses to save money.
__label__Attack	I have changed my vote for the first time in my life - voted by post. I am totally disenchanted by the depressing standard of human being that is offered by the two main parties.  They never answer questions and swerve with their repetitive rhetoric. They take the public for fools and wind their sentences away from every question. How can ANYONE believe in those kinds of people.  They are out for themselves ONLY.	Because zero hour contracts aren't good for people who want to work full time hours. A mortgage advisor is hardly going to think you are an ideal buyer.
__label__Support	AI is the way to go for sure since there it's not human-based	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__Support	This would eliminate inappropriate comments	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__Attack	I believe if almost everyone who knows about hate speech will know what to say  and what not to say.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Would also LOVE this. Brexit has screwed my entire industry (touring musician) over 	yes but we seem to be letting the worst of them who are not wanted in their home countries - most are comming for the money and not to try to integrate or make britain a better place
__label__Support	Whether or not it is a hoax, human having rational thinking he have the guilty when he affect the environment with pollution like fumes, industrial wastes and other things damaging the society.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology 
__label__Support	All of those yes, but has Labour got those covered I don't think any of them know what they are doing now 	Not more funding, but better use of the money they have.
__label__Support	You are right. The problem is slowly growing which is why we need to take steps to address it now.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	I think DominicJ is onto something however with technology being on our finger tips and Artificial intelligence making things easier i think having a software that can be able to restrict those criteria can be a good thing and will be automated	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	I agree	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Support	Definitely, which party do you think would be best for the task? 	I am not sure who is responsible for enforcing the legislation?
__label__Support	involved	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__Attack	A party that encourages personal responsibility, and that ain't Labour	Essentially agree on all of these plus add the NHS and social care
__label__Attack	Society needs to change, desperately	It doesn't matter whos in power, they all sing off the same hymn sheet 
__label__Support	That can come with an advantage since people would feel more scared of repercussions in case they do harm other people (basically, if not by empathy, then we use the law).	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	I completely agree!	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__Attack	The conservatives have had 14 years in power, and 5 elections, this is not jumping ship, this is an attempt to fix the problems they have caused 	needs funding and making more efficient
__label__Attack	Stops hates speech	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Stronger action could damage EU-Israel relations	There is a need for better regulation and control of social media and AI
__label__Support	I agree - some of the highest earners have been quoted as saying they are willing to pay more in tax. 	Yes, absolutely. 
__label__Attack	I agree with you but there would have to be a lot of work put into the filters as people do get around them and still are able to make their hateful points using text speak or misspelling ever so slightly.  This is just something that would have to be considered.	"In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check ""users"" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help"
__label__Attack	I don't think this would a particularly helpful thing to do. Comment sections help readers make their contribution(s) to the discourse. Perhaps the development of algorithms that work through the comments to identify what's inappropriate and remove it.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	It may require significant political will and budget to implement	European countries should recognize the State of Palestine
__label__Support	they need to make it easier for a young person to buy a house 	"NHS reform is important, but needs more management (it's well below levels in comparable systems), more investment, and greater integration into the social care system. ""Efficiency"" is used to imply fewer managers and admin staff, which is the opposite of what is needed. We need to free up frontline staff from needing to manage and do admin."
__label__Support	It is nice to think we could reduce hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Dental care is, as my NHS care was taken away. 	none of them seem to be honest  
__label__Attack	Yes, I totally agree with this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	to disallow readers comments is an unnecessary response as these communities can still be found elsewhere	"The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of ""cognitive dissonance"" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context."
__label__Attack	True but we need to set an example as if we discard such an important issue, other countries will take that as an excuse to do nothing	Cost of Living crisis
__label__Attack	Education is a great tool but essentially your website gives the solution without the steps. First people need to learn how to disarm the person they're debating with to educate them, which most people don't have the finesse to do. How do you change someones views when they're defensive from start to finish of your conversation?	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it.  https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__Attack	Hateful comments should allow respondents to persuade otherwise.  Comments can be a good force for change and shouldn't be cancelled.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Moderators will allow for fair reviiews	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__Support	i think this would be a good thing and i totally agree - free speech without hate should be and is possible.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I don't think that's true anymore - working in a large corporation, 5 years ago, we would have never talked about sustainability, been willing to pay more for anything sustainable, or frankly, really been concerned. Now, we have no real choice - consumers are simply demanding it.	This conversation seems to be pointless as our opinions will probably never be heard by those who are in control and authority and by big government who controls the people. They are the ones that need to hear and listen to the  people through forums and discussions
__label__Attack	I don't think dated attitudes are the issue in the NHS so much as it all comes down to lack of resourcing. I've spoken to many people working there who also work in the private sector and they are absolutely capable of using modern technology. They just don't have access to it and overhauling system costs money. 	But first and foremost you have to agree with what theyre promising
__label__Support	https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__Support	I completely agree with this. There are multiple exposes and car engineering shows were independent organizations show not only that we can reduce carbon emissions, but that we can also run cars way more efficiently with our current fossil fuels. If people demand the same level of efficiency with future fossil fuel using vehicles we can begin to make real changes. This will in turn give us the time necessary to begin building the infrastructure necessary for those alternative fuel sources as we will need to build electric gas stations and charge stations around the country before demanding an increase in those alternative vehicles from organizations.	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.
__label__Attack	a total media distraction from the far far bigger issues in the country on NHS, housing, roads, education. people get sucked into the nigel farage / priti patel nonsense that this is a huge issue when it isnt.  	The economy, health and immigration
__label__Attack	Too big a problem to deal with	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Since most of the climate change is caused by big organisations, I dont think just adapting to climate change is the right thing to say. There is a lot that is out of our hands.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers. The only purpose they serve is announcing your views to everyone else reading the same article. It's unnecessary and people's opinions are rarely changed by what they read in the comments section from some random reader/commenter.	I was completely taken aback by  some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__Support	Even if bare minimum they condemn the genocide that's happening in palestine but they won't until it's no longer profitable to support israel	Also a lot of waste
__label__Support	True, we need to increase technology to deal with this problem. 	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	Less people will be willing to pay.	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__Support	There needs to be a strict line between 'Free speech' and 'Hate speech'.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	What do you think the government can do about this, this is mostly due to the uk population, not much the government can do 	Ensuring the NHS remains unprivatised is essential. Having recently spent more time than i would have liked in hospital due to ill family members, my family would be in crippling debt now if not for the NHS. 
__label__Support	"""E.g. rebound effect."" (Crispin Edwards) "	Maybe we should prioritise ergonomic chairs
__label__Attack	yes this absolutly true, newspapers should not be acting like the censorship police	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	It is politically incorrect  to defy people their freedom of speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	I agree with moderation and the need for education and increased open-mindedness and respect	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	They should still be responsible for their words, as they are adults, so surely they know what they are doing.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	unfortunately, people may continue to not adhere with the proper language of communication under comments.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__Attack	What crisis?	Please vote! Even if you go against the grain
__label__Support	Hate speech is not acceptable and this would help to prevent the  possibly of appearing online.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	In a fast moving comments section with lots of commentators it would be impossible to moderate in real time.	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle.  Needs real time moderation.
__label__Support	Avoids AI filtering out free speech	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__Support	I'd like to see new parties formed like in France but our voting system stops that happening	We owe our future generation the responsibility of keeping the planet safe for them, this is a non-negotiable obligation.
__label__Attack	infringing on free speech	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	is half an hour would be sufficient for that? it might take more time for people to get together into groups 	There are risks of AI being used maliciously in deliberation processes
__label__Support	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.	I believe that all types of hate speech should be removed. All comments should be pre assessed by an overlooked before comments are posted. We should still be able to comment and have freedom of speach to express an opinion, but no hate speech.
__label__Attack	If we don't ask corporations to step in and get involved, then we're ignoring the biggest contributor of this issue - EVERYBODY needs to be involved. 	Rich nations rigged poor (powerless) nations. By choosing bio-fuel or dams solutions they just sentencing poor nations to extinction
__label__Attack	Please vote! Even if you go against the grain	Pensions, Immigraation, the NHS, 
__label__Attack	Labour is the same as Conservatives	Agree - issues around housing asylum seekers in hotels etc need to be solved
__label__Attack	journalists views become one sided, people can not engage to support.disagree	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	hate speech will take over the comment section. it is as the website owner to instate policies.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	This is probably the optimal solution, but it  also requires a lot of work force and might be quite expensive, too.	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__Support	The cost and amount  of management  in NHS is a scandal	I used to vote Green because I care about the environment. Now they rarely mention that - they seem more concerned about men who think they are women and prioritise them over the rights of women and girls
__label__Attack	Everyone should be included in dialogue, not just the middle	We should focus communication efforts on the middle ground rather than extreme positions
__label__Support	I think it is a good idea to be able to flag the comment so moderators can review it	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	"""EU is going to give a carbon credit for buildings that have been there for a long time"" (Peter Cox)"	we shouldn't be worried about ai because it creates jobs regardless if a lot of people lose their jobs
__label__Attack	Removing the comment section will not prevent hate speech from occurring. People will find an alternative online platform, e.g. forums. Instead, companies should focus on moderating the comment section/providing links as to why posts that may be flagged are harmful. We need to focus more on prevention as opposed to reaction.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	how do you regulate what hate speech is and who by?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Some comments can be seen as hate speech but they are not hate speech. They will be taken down and that will prevent freedom of speech	Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__Attack	I agree that in removing hate speech there is a chance that we could be silencing valid criticism and curtailing freedom of speech. However, I do think that sometimes there can be a fine line between criticism and hate speech and I would much rather see valid criticism removed than to see hate speech spread.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree because it will be easy to identify hate speech like this without completely taking away the ability to express opinions	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__Support	agree, their government has not been professional or competent	what an idiot the lib dem leader seems
__label__Attack	i enjoy reading comments but some comments can be sweary,name calling, troll like behaviour, which should be stopped.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Support	i agree	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post.  Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)
__label__Attack	The current system of voting does have its issues. But there is still value in voting. 	i am not sure if this is recording what i say
__label__Support	yeah .. there should be notification if somebody answered your question/opinion 	all spot on 
__label__Attack	Everyone has an opinion, and I agree that no one should be silenced. However I do not believe that the comment section of a newspaper article is where people should have the freedom to write hate	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree, hate speech needs to be dealt with from the root of the problem, it is not the responsibility of news services to police this.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	Agreed, we don't want tax increasing. NHS could do with some work too. Even pensions are getting taxed ?!?!	I think AI is going to become a big problem over the next year and this needs to be closely monitred and safe huarded
__label__Attack	I think this could be a good idea, but people will probably eventually find workarounds to avoid the censoring (as seen with spam bots using alternate characters in Youtube comments for example)	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__Attack	Climate Change is the main issue  It causes a lot damage to our environment  Thanks to some of the volunteers who are helping to fix the issue by sharing the issues in mass media to cover up a lot of people 	Maybe. But all humanity should collectively act together with the lead of the big super powers. If USA and China stay out, I am afraid it would be useless
__label__Support	Less Issues with arguments and trolls	I think it is ok to remove the comments. There are other places people can go to express opinions.
__label__Attack	what is considered non-beneficial to a discussion.

__label__Attack	People still need the comment section since it allows for open conversation and allows for people to find like mnded individuals.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	Firtly, i think the newpaper need to acknowledge the concern of hate speech. And is importnant because we can never fully avoid it. So the newspaper should have a platform support people who are targets of hate speech.	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__Attack	Nice point	Hate speech is hidden love that is just imperfectly expressed and should be protected 
__label__Attack	The scots already had their independence vote - do you want to keep running one until you get the answer you want?	Would provide personalized, relevant information to citizens
__label__Support	I think an AI could be very useful as well because it would take emotion out of equation when reaching decisions about what speech should be weeded out.	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist.  Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with.  But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged.  There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__Support	What will take place tomorrow will be theatre. The problem is the system as a whole. The real power lies with the banks and financial institutions.

__label__Attack	AI is a good solution but it can not detect hate speech that is in certain languages, currently AI can not translate all the languages spoken in the world.	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__Support	Agree. Certain words can be filtered and if triggered comment can be removed	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__Support	Agreed, more understanding and education are always good for society. Moderation functions as a good intermediary for discussion.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__Support	I agree 100%. And to add people should be asked to explain their comments. Most hateful comments are just people trolling and looking to cause a stir.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Support	agree with this! Lack of education is often the biggest culprits when it comes to hate speech - many people are scared of things they don't know about.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	I agree with Ian. It has real life consequences. It is important that moderators can identify hate speech, that is not free speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Who decides what is categorised as Hate Speech?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this point because I think freedom of speech is fundamental in a modern and democratic society but at the same time we cannot avoid the fact that online hate speech have become a problem and we should deal with it	Human-based detection exists for certain content, but represents a really high cost for companies. 
__label__Attack	I tend to think that the government subsidizes too much already	And the Govt must give rewards to those who do activities to protect the environment.
__label__Support	it can be regulated	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	It seems that massive industrial scale projects are what caused climate change. Large scale industry is a major cause of pollution.

Also, the whole ""state control"" meme seems to be disingenous: in times of great crisis the state not only may but MUST intervene for the safety and security of all. That is the core reason for the state to exist."	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Support	it allows people to interact and share their opinion on the subject.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	I  think its very easy to say this but what is the alternative?	Hard to disagree with anything that you've said.  All crucial and will affect almost everybody.
__label__Support	yes true i find no one really reads those comments anyways	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__Attack	Lack of employment rights and guaranteed pay for those that need it. You're lucky to be in a position where it does not matter as much	That's an excellent point in fairness.

Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__Support	I agree. I personally enjoy posting my opinion thinking people think I'm smart. I don't know if I change people's minds but I think in the moment, I think I'm both clever and nice. If I couldn't comment, it'd ruin the whole Facebook post experience for me. (Source: My experience)	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	not true	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Less consumers/readers/	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.

__label__Support	It's true that this would eliminate hate speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Under current laws, restauranters are responsible for hate speech among their diners, so I certainly think platform owners should be responsible for the presence of hate speech on their websites. Hate speech is a criminal offence, after all.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Absolutely, hate speech forms thoughts, which forms character which leads to violent actions with enough time. It's a very serious issue that causes real world harm to marginalized communities when left unchecked.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	completly agree	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__Support	"I feel newspapers don't work well and an interactive medium anyway. ""letters to the editor"" might be an avenue"	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Anonymity empowers people and might make them more willing to express extreme opinions. Verified profiles reduces anonymity.	This is an interesting article on the outcomes of several news agencies that disabled the comments section. Some of the writers of articles were getting subjected to abusive messages.  This would be another argument for verified profiles only allowed to access the websites with their real names and details.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	there is a difference in exchange of ideas and then being hateful.	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__Support	Thankfully, Scotland has a different choice.	Foresight capabilities already exist but are not always heeded
__label__Attack	I can understand the reason why that might remove some of the problem, but that argument is a bit like saying, some roads frequently experience traffic jams, so let's get rid of all the cars. What's more important is the effective moderation of hate speech - and also crucially to call out mistruths. Discussions are the starting point.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	i also agree with lawrenceM as i believe the filters need to be improved and if they arent there,  then they need to be made,	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	it really is for the vast number of people struggling. 	well, lets get this started. Cost of living, energy costs and the terrible state of the NHS
__label__Attack	The whole point of comment sections is so that people can provide their opinion on what they've seen/read, stopping this only minimizes debate and being able to view differing opinions. This then leads to break off groups choosing to use other platforms and thus having platforms with polar opinions which can be dangerous as people could be exposed to only one viewpoint	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	I agree, but I don't know what the mechanism would be for linking comments to the actual people who made them.	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.

You can say they are using more and more chemical in agriculture to grow more and fast which is not at all good for the human ultimately and to the nature.
__label__Attack	This should prevent such comments from being printed, but I think any attempt to 'educate' such persons is totally futile. They are hard-wired to hold that point of view, often drilled into them by parents/caregivers.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Support	I agree, it may be a better idea to have neutral admin who can monitor comments, rather than the producer of the article or an algorithm.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I definitely agree with your position, a certain level of regulation is needed, as looking at the current situation there are still many problems regarding online comments.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	There should be a warning to ban the account of someone who uses hate words in the comment section.	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__Support	If a media regulate how people respond to their news, they can aid the fight against hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

Rich countries support it as a cheap form of energy, yet it has a high CO2 profile 
__label__Support	I actually really like this idea - it deals well with the issue of removing hate speech as nothing just gets automatically published and checked later. Yes it will cut down on the amount of comments overall but even that isn't a bad thing, if only the most coherent, high-quality comments are published.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Support	Yes, completely agree and efficiency in police work to allow meaningful work - yes paperwork and accountability needs to be done but why not restructure with more admin staff? also mental health service to free the police to concentrate on crime.

__label__Support	Newspapers have to be free to censor  but finding the balance between legitimate comment and hate speech is more difficult that it first appears.  We can have different thresholds of what we find acceptable in an open forum.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	You can't complain about anything if you don't vote. If you do vote and lose you can always blame the people that voted for the party that messes the country up. 	Taxes are a good thing: how do you think we pay for things we all need, like the roads, transport, the NHS? 
__label__Support	Because pretending as if it's not happening doesnt mean it will stop when there is a disable comment.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.

__label__Support	There are certain steps we can take to help with climate change. Just sitting back sayin that nothing can be done isn't helping anything. We need to step up and take steps toward improving the situation. 	Hope the lock down because of corona must have proved that the environment is less polluted when people stop coming out of their home. But it is not possible to stay at home completely. But it is a evidence that human is polluting the economy. so they can reduce the pollution by way of using electric vehicles, cycling and other ways

__label__Support	Totally agree. It still gives space to express but will limit the hate speech	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether.

__label__Attack	no hate	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__Attack	Hate speech is used to intentionally hurt others. It cannot be allowed in modern-day society and should not be seen as free-speech	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group

__label__Attack	Aggression is a subjective aspect. Someone may be expressing themselves passionately, but is seen as aggressive. Cultural differences and misinterpretation of words and intent can also influence opinion of a comment's 'aggression'.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I'm not very sure that an automated system is the answer. There are many cases of false positives, particularly when other users attempt to have a discussion with the offender. The machine picks up on keywords used commonly in hate speech and the users attempting a discussion may use these keywords as well.	I think there must be a system that will detect hateful comments and block them.
__label__Support	There should already be policies that hinder hate speech as it seems that the problem is escalating	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	I agree with this. With that being said, we as consumers need to demand more from the same organizations. We need to go to all levels of government and demand that these same organizations give us alternatives in the form of electric and hydro cars while also proving that we are ready to purchase them to give these same organizations incentive to play along.  	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.

__label__Attack	at least he has integrity	NHS is main priority for me too.
__label__Support	Having moderators filter out bad words or  comments that contain hate speech would do so much good. This allows everybody to comment their opinion but remove those that are hateful and disrespectful.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	Agree with your suggestions.  I had the same idea.  However, there would need to be a way to get around mispellings of words to get around the blocked vocabulary.	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__Attack	I don't think algorithm can accurately detect hate speech.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	This is an invasion of privacy.	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__Support	If you want to get your  version of the news without any context as to how it's received by the public this would be convenient	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Support	I think adding chat bans for repeat offenders of hate speech could help.	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is already defined in law in many countries. As its already a criminal offence , the existing legislation provides the definition of hate speech, and blueprint to follow.	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.

A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__Support	I totally agree!	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__Support	I do think that people just comment on things even if they don't have a strong opinion about it, just because it's easy to.

I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__Attack	I would agree, but this article (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0163443712472089?casa_token=FJm_UB0wIqEAAAAA%3ALr9dI-lrHJemMa9XgBVkx8tCkSQUSUAg14owxExDkpThv0tpIu6LJySR_p7EJ_lPqQbiATTxEfULs7k) states that filtering racism doesn't really stop racism, it just encourages it to go elsewhere. Maybe it will protect sites that use it, but otherwise, people will still find racism online. And maybe that's not the responsibility of the news site, but I find it disheartening still.	"In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to ""teach"" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all."

__label__Support	It will help stop hate speech which is very important	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

We need a new financial system which is not a debt based fiat system.  
__label__Attack	Newspapers should be neutral, but you find that they are often the ones who actually instigate hate speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	This is a good idea, there are a lot of sites that use AI bots that block out hate speech, bad words, and they are more appropriate for all ages. Keeps the tone of the comments at a decent level	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.

__label__Support	maybe fake news will be reduced in this way	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Support	Also difficult to ensure that humans won't make mistakes and overcensor	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument

__label__Support	I would agree that a moderator system would be a better choice than removing the comments.	I stand by my position of a moderator system
__label__Attack	would require more than 1 moderator	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	Internet education is definitely needed	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social  media problem as well, more like an internet problem.

__label__Attack	can algorithms be trusted	having moderators approve comments
__label__Support	Absolutely true. Everyone has freedom of speech. We live in a democratic country where everyone have the right to speak and all voices need to be heard. It is up to the individual to make sure that they put forward their points without being too aggressive and not getting carried away.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I completely agree with this. There are multiple exposes and car engineering shows were independent organizations show not only that we can reduce carbon emissions, but that we can also run cars way more efficiently with our current fossil fuels. If people demand the same level of efficiency with future fossil fuel using vehicles we can begin to make real changes. This will in turn give us the time necessary to begin building the infrastructure necessary for those alternative fuel sources as we will need to build electric gas stations and charge stations around the country before demanding an increase in those alternative vehicles from organizations. 	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.
__label__Attack	But if people´s right to speek is crossing the border towards hatered speech then you are disregarding another´s right of respect 	I agree that positive communication will be important - perhaps that starts with us working through not only areas of consensus but also identifying some of the fears / assumptions around which disagreements foment?

__label__Attack	I've seen it work well, but the algorithm needs to be somewhat transparent	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__Support	Exactly! It's not true democracy. 	Better foresight could help prepare for crises
__label__Attack	"I think it's a little more nuanced than curtailing freedom of speech. If we define the right to free speech as ""the right to speak, write, and share ideas and opinions without facing punishment from the government"", you have to consider that news websites and social media are not moderated by the government or required to allow freedom of speech.  If a news website is to be truly impartial, I don't personally believe that opinions of the layman provide any benefit and can often be harmful.  That however, is only my opinion ;)"	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	People who are spreading hate speech usually won't care for being educated	By simply educating people about what harm hate speech can do to a person

I feel that climate change is happening on some level, but question how much of it is due to a natural cycle and how much to human activity.

__label__Support	Thats a reasonable idea however, there needs to updates that automatically flag out inappropriate comments	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal 	but doesn't the detection ai get better at filtering the more it works?
__label__Attack	I would agree, with addition that also misinformation, especially one that could induce negative consequences  should be treated the same as hate speech	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__Attack	People could just as easily reward negative and hateful comments if they agree with them	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__Attack	But allowing hate speech to flourish would mean that comment space would be filled with spammers and hate speech and it would become useless.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	i think most voting in northern ireland is tactical.

__label__Attack	If there was identifiable information available (to the owner of the website), for people who contribute their opinions publicly, it would make people less inclined to say awful things.	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__Support	i agree, this would be useful as it can keep other comments	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__Support	Maybe this can engender a difference of awareness in the society as a whole.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	Continuing as normal.	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__Attack	It would be hard for anyone to not be bias as we have different opinions on subjects and one might thing that the  comment is appropriate and someone else might not think so. It can be subjective at times.	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__Attack	I  think that would be unfair to other people who do not post hate speech.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Support	they have been abysmal 	Are you voting for less immigration or a different methodology of how we currently do it?
__label__Support	I agree with this. With that being said, we as consumers need to demand more from the same organizations. We need to go to all levels of government and demand that these same organizations give us alternatives in the form of electric and hydro cars while also proving that we are ready to purchase them to give these same organizations incentive to play along.	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.

__label__Support	comments on every platform can become a breeding ground for hate. It becomes a place for people to vent and voice their hateful comments, it can also lead to bullying and other negative aspects of online life. Comments should be banned unless heavily moderated.	This is something that I think is impossible to do. One can never ever be sure  of people s intensions. I don't believe newspaper websites should even have space for readers comments , there are other platforms where readers can express themselves

There are far more sustainablity actions that should be taken before dietary constrictions, like reducing the loop of consumption in the US which is based on inflation and debt generation.
__label__Attack	I disagree, as newspaper websites should be held accountable (in some form) for the public engagement of their content. This should be done to mitigate the risks of cyberbullying https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/cyberbullying	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	Realistically this would probably work, but it would no doubt still have problems like people raising issues of 'suppressing free speech' etc.	i think one of the best ways is to allow everyone  a free space of commenting yet making sure that all the hate speech is automatically blocked no one can see those comments except the administrator

An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.

__label__Support	Removing comment spaces completely reduces social participation which is super imporrant for educating others.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Reform have no actionable plans whatsoever and are fuelled by fearmongering	I still have not made my mind up who to vote for as its always the same promises....
__label__Attack	While yes we should all be able to communicate freely, with the anonymity of the internet internet trolls go too easily unpunished and their actions not removed	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree - a much more coherent strategy is needed 	Coundn't agree more!
__label__Attack	It would reduce hate comments to the max.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I disagree! There could errors in implanting this to begin with and it may discourage them from using it, and therefore these products in general. I feel a dedicated team for tackling this matter or if a smaller company general overseers from time to time would be better and also hold a more human opinion on whether it is deemed hate or not.	Websites should invest in software to remove hate speech, this would allow for healthy debate without racist or descrimination.
__label__Attack	While it looks fair to request readers to create accounts and enter their personal details before being able to comment, the reality is, data breaches are still very common. Expecting newspapers to keep readers data secure might not be realistic when such large and technologically advanced companies as Optus can become victims of hackers. Consequences of having personal customer data stolen can be severe. https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/23/optus-data-breach-customers-yet-to-be-reimbursed-for-passport-replacements	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious  consiquences
__label__Attack	The main question is how to determine what is considered as discrimination or violence. Opposing arguments can be flagged as discrimination or violense.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	the algorithm could be abused by users	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	when regulating the comments someone will always disagree or challenge the rules. Claim free speech has gone mad etc.	comments should be allowed on newspaper articles so that people can have a discussion and express their opinions, regulation would ultimately ensure that everything is kept in order.
__label__Support	Yes this is a sensible solution to this problem	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__Support	"""Indeed, see what can be done locally before using more general national approaches"" (Steven Bee)"	yes people will become dumber because they will train their brains power less 
__label__Attack	I have to agree with DamianC above, I notice a lot of hate speech on twitter for example and I feel this would if anything create more problems as they would have zero control over the platform.	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__Attack	In some ways I disagree, as renters have a right to earn money during the increased housing costs, but also I do agree that kicking people out when they decide to up the prices is horrific. It should be that an agreed price is arranged and the government do something to make sure that the need for increased rent is limited. 	It could increase democratic legitimacy of the Commission
__label__Attack	no opportunity to discuss topics	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	also most newspapers stories are also posted online and out there forever on the internet.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	If you disagree with how they run their websites, run your own website.	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other.  Nobody has a right to comment on anything.

__label__Attack	100% agree, Comment section is for everyone to present their opinion at all times	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	I think it is the responsibility of the websites to moderate any hatefull comments. You can agree and disagree with somthing without hate.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	The state should buy land and built social housing instead of leaving it to the free market. 	i totally agree, they have been so corrupt
__label__Support	Makes a more friendly and respectful environment	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice. 
__label__Attack	I think it is important for newspapers to provide a platform for people to express and discuss their opinions. Being able to hear other peoples' opinions is an important part of educating oneself, so completely eliminating a comment section seems unprogressive.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	"I agree with this. I would extend it to the ""new religions"" too (such as gender ideology)."	i do not believe that any incoming governemnt will change too much, as I have already said, honesty is no longer an issue, just tell people wha they want to hear, and do the complete opposite 
__label__Support	I agree. In most cases people often react out of anger or disappointment, sometimes even without fully comprehending what is being said which I feel is the reason for some hate speech.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	Yep. First step is to get rid of the Tories.	I am sad to say that, following the information on the media, politicians seem to be less than 100% reliable.
__label__Attack	will not work at all the dynamics of the comments section are very polarised	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	In theory, I really like this idea and feel it could minimise bullying and hate speech online.	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__Support	I agree, everyone has the right to their opinion and to express it	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Human-based detection exists for certain content, but represents a really high cost for companies.

__label__Attack	I don't really plan to vote either. I'd have no idea who to vote for. And not neccessairly because i dont follow politics, but because no matter who I vote for, they are all the same. Yeah they promise different things , but when they have the power they'll do absolutely nothing. 	Pensions, Immigraation, the NHS, 
__label__Attack	there is no guarantee that other platforms will not also have hate speech, if anything they might even encourage it more as they may attract a particular group of people who are interested in spreading hate speech	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	this literally achieves nothing	"A pop-up can be used which reads ""if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments""."
__label__Attack	I disagree, people know the damage but do not care.  They hide behind relative anonymity and so do not worry about what people think of their posts.  Like many things, you can educate as much as you want but if people choose not to listen it will make no difference	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Consideration for ALL not just one part of society 	totally agree , weve had a selfish government for too long
__label__Attack	good idea but you nead the right person with a good moral compass on board,to give a level playing field for all.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I partly agree, the issue with universities are that there are too many of them and many offer poor value courses with low quality of tuition. 	I agree that we need to rebuild our relationship with EU and vastly increase housebuilding. I think rejoining EU won't happen but realistically the single market instead (as much as I would wish we were still part of EU) 
__label__Support	Well said, its been here this long, I think its safe to assume it will stay that way for a long time.	Placing blame and/or trying to figure out who's at fault is pointless. It doesn't matter if it's the corporations, individuals, or natural processes--the problem exists, whatever the cause. And it has to be addressed, even if it's expensive, even if it's monumental, even if it seems impossible to solve--because without working toward a solution, our planet and ourselves will cease to exist.
__label__Support	Agree, this problem needs to be sorted, it can not violate human rights	I am not sure if what i am typing is being recorded....
__label__Support	I agree, the comment section should likely remain but be heavily moderated and regulated to disallow hate speech as the article above says	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Very true! Once a party is elected half the promises go out the window! 	Agree and they have nothing to show for it
__label__Attack	"In my country, and I have no doubt in many others, incitement to hatred is punishable by law. So, when you write that it is not the problem of newspapers or websites, I can only be astonished. It is too easy to start a controversy that may have consequences and to defend it by saying: ""we have started a discussion, the outcome is not our responsibility, we wash our hands of it""."	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	What do you consider the feedback loops, first we have to list them. 	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	This sounds like a very expensive solution - I think maybe more time and money should be spent on algorithms that can do the same thing	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__Attack	While I agree, there are many ways in which these auto-moderation technologies can be bypassed. https://newmediaservices.com.au/9-ways-to-bypass-auto-moderation/	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__Support	It's a good idea to reduce anonymity so more people can be linked to the things they say and rightly may think twice about coming across as a hateful person.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__Attack	I also think these should be monitored to a certain degree because hurtful comments can't be out there like they are currently	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	We need some approaches to actually preventing hate speech and putting an end to it.	Hate speech will always appear on open forums.  The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__Attack	Some people with genuine or kind comments may be put off interacting	I agree with FransescoT online forums can be a wonderful community but hate speech with faceless people can ruin it. If you want to comment there should be some accountability.
__label__Attack	The NHS is a bottomless pit. However much money you put in it will be spent and more required.	Agree no such thing as illegal immigration
__label__Support	The NHS has been deliberately led to fail in order to fastrack it's privatisation. 	Hardly the most important issue just now
__label__Support	Report comment buttons would make that comment flagged up to moderators and therfore removed quickly	report comment buttons could be useful but there should be monitors that check comments before they are allowed to be posted
__label__Attack	At the same time, people have a right to comment and discuss - the more we engage with difficult topics and debate, the more we practice our critical thinking, and I think we owe the average commenter more credit than thinking they can't differentiate between opinion and fact.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	we need to understand that freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of hatred	Agreed
__label__Support	I agree. So many crimes/acts of violence in the real world have begun as online comments. It is certainly an important topic to discuss and find the right solutio n for.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	essential for the country 	Jail time for those that have commited fraud, we go to prison, they pay a paltry fine and mumble sorry
__label__Attack	agree as it can sometimes be very harmful	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	No as not everyone may rely on AI	Sharing how we all have learning from failure is very refreshing
__label__Attack	Privacy concern.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Yes I'm sure there is software that can do that.	Censor out words
__label__Attack	there is a difference between hate speech and an opposite view	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion
__label__Support	hope they don't fix the ballot and its noticed that more and more people are deciding none of the options are what we want 	They can't be handled any worse than how they are currently handled though.
__label__Attack	This is not in line with our right to freedom of speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion 	it should target the insulting and violation to individual and groups right by law or common morality  
__label__Attack	If newspaper columnists can publish their opinions, why can't the public enjoy the same freedoms?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	We should stay of it all - its horrible yes but focus on the UK 	Yes I agree this is absolutely huge, but we need to reposition it, not make it so doom-laden as it turns many people off. There are opportunities for green technology, get ahead of the energy transition etc. Small changes by lots of people make a difference.
__label__Attack	But how the the average person avoid these companies big expensive ideas when they are just about making ends meet now?	While trying to sort. climate change, we cannot just shut the economy off, so yes we need cheap energy
__label__Attack	This would require a special team to supervise the comment section at all times which might be costly.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree, both such important issues	More help for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder
__label__Support	I agree that we have to try. There is no quitting. 	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	"""Strategy and policy, guidance, controls, support"" (Crispin Edwards)"	Not exaclty, you can't talk in a way that hurts other people
__label__Support	Not a bad idea, give them all a shot at working together, instead of ripping each other apart 	The environment and immigration are just as important as the economy and the NHS. The latter two have more far reaching consequences than the first two in many respects 
__label__Support	I agree this would helpfilter some of the hate speech	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__Support	There is a lot of discord currently within the country, conservative have had time but a change is needed. 	100% agree
__label__Support	It is happening due to some natural causes too. Technology can't stop the natural course of things.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Support	But I don't see what they can do , in the short-term at least. The govt is screwed as it's built up billions of debt (and the BofE had to bail them out thanks to Kwarteng's budget). They need to raise money somehow, so that has to be through taxation, but to suggest a plan that wins voters from all sides is tricky 	treating refugees with more compassion 
__label__Support	takes away the ability for people to express their hate	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	The most inspiring leadership is natural, organic, open and honest.	Deliberative democracy will focus on co-creating new ideas with broad citizen engagement. 
__label__Support	Yep, fully agree with this	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	Moderators who follow specific guidelines so that they are all consistent would be the best option to eleiminate bias	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Theyre all so similar in the end... no one really stands up for the people 	true that 
__label__Attack	You're trusting an algorithm that would need to be trained by humans - so the AI itself could still be biased.	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__Attack	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	By using moderators or AI to police the posts
__label__Support	I think brexit is the main cause of that	Bring back legal routes for immigrants with speedy processing of claims
__label__Attack	This may filter out individuals with valid opinions who just don't feel comfortable without commenting with a degree of anonymitiy	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__Attack	Requiring people to give a lot of information about themselves in order to give their opinion online is NOT a direction we should be going in. Moderators are fine; requiring people to dox themselves so they can be educated is not it.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	This is totally untrue.Freedom of speech will exist one way or another and newspapers shoul dbe promotign public views by regulated platforms, so they can be in touch with peoples real thinking and also allow othr people form their own opinions about current issues	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I agree with you about the level of crime and the economy and also the state of the environment. In some respects the economy could be linked to levels of crime as people are experiencing issues with day to day expenses and this could be inpacting the level of crime especially petty crime 	Some parties will say anything and can say anything as they have zero hope of getting in.  How some expect to fund any of their wild pledges is laughable. 
__label__Attack	I believe ALL websites with ANY content are responsible for the messages their content conveys - be it articles, podcasts, videos or comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	If we are to retain these properties in use then their cost of ownership/occupancy must be made comparable with alternative properties.  Options include ongoing financial support for operating costs, affordable upgrades to reduce operating cost.	Cost of upgrades, which are always higher for properties in a heritage setting, are unaffordable for individual owners in low wage, low property value areas. 
__label__Support	https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/ This is especially true because not all people speak the language! An algorithm would be best, but there are still some technical issues that we need to address.	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__Support	This is correct, as blocking free speech altogether leads us into a very different type of society. It is a tricky dilemma, how to allow free speech but prevent hate speech, but one that does need attention and ideas	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I don't think the best education policy will combat trolls, bad faith actors or targeted/well orchestrated hate campaigns.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	This is a great solution	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting
__label__Attack	https://www.salon.com/2018/11/17/why-comments-sections-must-die/ While this article seems to agree with this point of view, I still feel that taking away spaces for discussion isn't the way to control hate speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Support	Yes. More high rises.	My food bill has increased massively and my wages haven't gone up to help me pay it
__label__Attack	some ideas are extreme and inconsiderate	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	ensures a safe and protected readers environment	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__Support	do you agree with part privatisation?	But many people who want to work aren't able to because they have conditions that would be treatable but massive NHS backlogs have stopped them getting the help they need
__label__Attack	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__Support	Reduces the amount of troll comments	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names.  Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__Attack	Yes, I think there are major issues needing sorting first although I agree this need to be addressed. 	It just so happens we had to go to A&E yesterday as our daughter hurt her head. We were waiting for almost 3 hours and later found out that there was a doctors strike and didn't even manage to even see a doctor. We ended up leaving...
__label__Attack	The world is changing in terms of human empowerment and the connectedness of the individual and the transparency of the powers that be. The opinions of the people CAN be heard and change is possible. Humanity needs to work together and gain strength from one another. 	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts. 
__label__Support	The CO2 level increases the most reason for climate change because the CO2 level increase it cause the air pollution.The pollution range increase is the problem of climate change.So I agree with you. 	I have heard that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference Closes with Limited Ambition
__label__Attack	Europe lacks a unified approach on the issue	It can help improve efficiency and sustainability of production
__label__Attack	there is no common sense with hate speech so it cant be classed as free speech	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__Support	https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-social-media-use-linked-to-decline-mental-health	Hate speech does more harm than good
__label__Attack	The downside to this is who will moderate and what will be their baseline.  It's a real challenge.	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__Support	Yes I agree completely about immigration. It should be monitored a lot lot more and stricter measures brought in place to decrease it.	Rebulding the NHS, better education, taxation, honesty and integrity of elected representitives

__label__Support	True people should be able to express their opinions	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I actually agree. Just have the news present a perspective. Readers can agree or disagree on their own.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	agreed. people will always want their opinions heard	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	no engage from the readers	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__Attack	There is a lack of global leadership to push for peace	Communication with consumers is challenging due to activist voices dominating the discourse
__label__Support	More emphasis on the smaller, daily things we can do to reduce waste would probably allow us to see change more quickly than being shamed about every product we use that might potentially be bad for the environment. Manufacturers can be a big part of that. If there are no cheap, dangerous plastic shopping bags made, then they won't be part of our homes that we need to deal with. It's definitely a group effort.	Many cultures include meat of some kind as part of their daily choices. Veganism as a movement reflects just a small part of humanity.
__label__Support	Just remove comment ability	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I agree, people need to review comments	In order to reduce hate speech in the comments section, newspapers need to employ moderators on their platforms so that there can be someone watching and removing all types of hate speech in the comments section.
__label__Attack	If the cancel that section then where will we be able to say what we feel. They will be robbing us of our free speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	Agree, the NHS needs to be restructured 	it really is for the vast number of people struggling. 
__label__Support	infrastructure for EV is terrible 	Education is a mess, particularly if you have a child with special needs. Months and months to battle for an EHCP and still no real help
__label__Support	Reduces spam/scam comments as well as hate speech.	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names.  Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__Attack	Requires a lot of moderation	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__Support	AI would be a great tool in conjunction with other moderation measures but is not reliable enough to be used on its own.	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__Attack	the issue with an algorithm is that is isnt able to sympathise with news. yes it is good to filter out bad words but i think hate speech can be relative to the user digesting that information	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	although I do think that, however, we should consider how many people do in fact post hateful comments without the protection of anonymity. look at Facebook, for instance - it's absolutely full of hate speech from people posting under their names using accounts that people can view and learn more about them. perhaps if people are truly hateful then being known for this isn't a problem for them after all.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__Attack	I do believe that removing the comment section is the right thing to do. even though some may see it as restricting free speech	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Support	The NHS needs funding and support! 	Also they all seem to spend all the time having a go at each other instead of telling us what we need to know about what they are going to do and how they are going to pay for it.
__label__Attack	Dialogue alone doesn t lead to action or policy changes	We need to create more shared spaces for dialogue between different stakeholders
__label__Support	Yep, this helps in eradicating hate words and people will notice that such is not allowed	Go through and censor out certain words
__label__Support	there is need of moderators so people know they are being monitored and they can behave themselves also a filtering of swear words would help	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I agree, if we were to allow the public to have 'freedom of speech' We need to ensure someone who is unbiased can remove the comments that will only fuel hatred and not give a well structured opinion a chance.	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__Attack	That is the problem not everyone thinks that they saying something hateful until someone mentions it.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	while I do agree with this, it makes me sad that our society is so soured that people cannot use self control	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	How do people exercise freedom of speech?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Support	Not allowing anonymous posts will turn off individuals from commenting, that's limiting the ideas that others could have contributed	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__Attack	"This is not a realistic approach at this time. With the definition of ""hate speech"" becoming more and more loose and up for interpretation, this sets a dangerous precedent of government and law enforcement overreach. The only time where law enforcement may need to get involved is with blatant calls to violence - physical violence - or inciting hatred against a targeted individual or group. I agree somewhat with this point, but not in the direction things are starting to head in today's times."

__label__Support	too many opinions can be conflicting	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health.

__label__Attack	quite an optimistic way to see it 	when we talk about filtering the critical aspect that usually arise is the fact what would be the criteria who gonna decide what is hate speech and what is canceling people's right to speak 
__label__Support	Exactly. It is honestly the first time we've been so close to polling day and I've had no idea what to do	There's a labour shortage right now and the adult social care system is heavily reliant on migrant labour.

__label__Attack	Could become another arena for political battles	Create an independent Judicial Council to handle judicial appointments
__label__Support	I agree, we need to be brought to seeing things from different angles and possibility of discussion is actually a good thing. Raising awareness on hate speech is key and should be taught from a young age.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Whilst I agree, not when people are spewing hate and creating a hateful echo chamber.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	We should not exclude any segments of the population from communication efforts	We should focus communication efforts on the middle ground rather than trying to persuade extreme positions
__label__Attack	Cybersecurity would have to be very strong if you mean physical addresses...	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__Support	This would help the content management team not have to answer every mail about comments.	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__Support	I completely agree. They are all just the same as each other.	I do think that Covid hugely affected the NHS and this would be difficult for the government to fix overnight (in addition to the funding crisis). 
__label__Support	Bigger than that; 1/3 of existing dwellings are of traditional (solid wall/naroow cavity) construction, and 75% of building work is to existing dwellings. This is not a niche. In this we differ substantially from most EU countries. BUT comfort doesn't necessarily equate to higher temperature, it's more about relative humidity and temperature differentials between people and surfaces. 	I cannot comment on that comment 
__label__Support	i think so,people should be able to express their views but comments must be moderated	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

It is impossible to ask about race. It is impossible to manage."", Person 35 "
__label__Support	I agree with both of these ideas. Having a moderation means consistency, but having other readers flag comments allows other commenters to hold peers to account and ensure that the comment section is an inclusive and fair section.

One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Absolutely correct. The important thing is to identify what hate speech actually means, because what is offensive to one individual might not be to another.	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__Support	Let’s be careful here. There is loads of evidence that being too cold indoors is bad for health. We should not be aiming to have the life expectancy/population health of earlier centuries just because old buildings used to be cold. (Gavin Killip) 	Not exaclty, you can't talk in a way that hurts other people
__label__Support	I agree with you. I don't know that there is a good solution.	I think reversing manmade climate change would be very difficult. Scientists might come up with solutions to attempt it, but I don't think it can be totally reversed.
__label__Support	I think every person I know my age who has children uses some type of informal/family-based childcare otherwise they would be unable to work due to the cost.

__label__Attack	yes i argree with this. it would not show that the newspaper is biased by leaving the positive comments only	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.

Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__Attack	 The leadership styles of the two parties are markedly different. In my view, Keir Starmer has demonstrated significantly stronger leadership compared to Rishi Sunak. Starmer has shown a clear vision and decisiveness in addressing key issues. However, there is still room for improvement. Starmer could enhance his leadership by being more proactive in policy development and more transparent in his decision-making processes. Meanwhile, Sunak's leadership has lacked the same level of clarity and direction, which has been a disadvantage during these challenging times. Both leaders have the potential to grow, but currently, Starmer stands out as the more effective leader, albeit with areas where he can still improve.	Left-wing extremism has taken hold of many of our institutions, to the extent that many people no longer view it as such.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	human rights of the masses should not be violated regardless of their beliefs and views
__label__Attack	would authors be held to account still?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	People are using hate speech in non sensitive articles too.	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__Support	Gathering data in a specific area of online discussion like newspaper comment sections would probably reveal a lot about how online discourse turns to hate speech and how to tackle it as a problem. Maybe this task could be given to an independent or charitable institution, with the newspapers' cooperation?	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Attack	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	how can you say this after the state the country is in	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!
__label__Attack	However a view point can be expressed appropriately as a constructive criticism by the target audience. Therefore you could argue that anyone who engages in hate speech is the wrong audience.	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__Attack	I think these people will then keep living in their own bubble and will never learn that their philosophy isn't normal.	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__Support	Agreed, seeing the numbers of people sleeping in corridors on a recent trip to A&E is shocking	I agree this is a pressing problem that hasn't received much coverage by the main parties
__label__Attack	Parties may resist internal reforms	Strengthen internal democracy within political parties
__label__Attack	Obviously there will be bias from the moderators as well, so this too will need to be kept in mind.	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely.  I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__Support	As a Scot, I can't agree. Labour is a perfectly good alternative (unless independence is your thing)> One great benefit of voting SNP would be rejoining the EU, though (although Indy is too high a price to pay). 	Immigration has gotten out of hand as has the cost of living

__label__Support	I don't agree, actually 	seems to me to describe management as much as leadership and too generic and not HE specific.......
__label__Attack	This works in terms of removing literal slurs from the platform, but doesn't account for when hate speech is more well-disguised or nebulous - how could we expect an automatic system to understand a dogwhistle?	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__Attack	I was quite happy when they were saying Rishi might fall in his constituency as that would be the ultimate put down for a sitting PM but sadly, they're now saying he might just hang on. I'd take your pick for sure!	Has to be the number one issue
__label__Support	new party need to be in power	I am sad to say that, following the information on the media, politicians seem to be less than 100% reliable.
__label__Support	This is true which is why I also suggested introducing a reporting feature so that, in cases where hate speech may not automatically be detected, people would still be able to raise a concern about the comment.	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__Attack	I feel that in this case, by getting rid of hate speech, I feel that it is worth sacrificing a part of free speech in order to make everyone feel comfortable.	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__Attack	problem is, it's not children doing it, its people past general education and often adverse to adult learning full stop	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	too many racists in the country  	Our NHS is on it's knees due to the lack of immigrants.

__label__Support	the link provides usefull ways for people to deal with hate speech	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.
__label__Support	covering both sides is great but we should be able to be respectful towards eachother	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	 I think that the human capital to employe human vetting would not be sufficient in a first filtering phase	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are! 
__label__Support	There needs to be an entire rethink about how it's funded. The NHS is a ticking time bomb in terms of funding. Either taxes are drastically going to go up for people in work/other forms of tax or it needs to be partly paid for at point of use. It's political suicide for whoever crosses that bridge. 	it really is for the vast number of people struggling. 
__label__Support	Certain words can be detected by the program which are hate speech and removed	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper

__label__Attack	sure what?	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__Support	All very important issues to consider when thinking about how to vote! I'm voting Green (probably) because of this, or potentially biting my tongue and voting Labour 	the fear of a labour landslide
__label__Support	The mention of collaborative efforts underscores the importance of multi-stakeholder involvement, which is crucial for effective solutions.	Neither of the main parties have given us reason to trust them, and even if smaller parties can be more scrupulous there's no point voting for them in a GE. It's all very frustrating. 
__label__Attack	Already we are ruin the nature to observe the CO2 and other gases.Now we are expecting the solution in technology side.It is not fully solution for change the climate.So we want to focus the nature resources management.

__label__Support	Good idea, never going to happen though!	Digital platforms can create echo chambers and polarization
__label__Attack	"You'd have to get everyone to agree on a definition for cyber bullying before creating the software. Computers only know what you tell them, they aren't sentient beings capable of moral distinction. The human programming the software defines the meaning of hate speech, this really ties into the book ""Noise"" which discusses variables and the way it can drastically change outcomes based on the individual handling things. What is their life experience, have they experienced bullying, have they gotten therapy etc. If it's more than one person you have to collectively agree on shared experiences that culminate to the final definition  of bullying."	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__Support	I agree, everybody has freedom of speech and we all have to right to access t information.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Helps prevent mental illnesses via online platforms.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	A moderating team might work but it could also be hard to revise every comment, specially is the newspaper is popular	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__Attack	giving those you always provide hate speech anonymously gives them the upper hand with gettong away with it. It makes it easier for them to do it over and over again	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__Support	moderators	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	The problem is can an algorithm actually make the full determination of what is hateful and not? It may have the same biases.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	People are on waiting lists for too long 	none of them seem to be honest  
__label__Support	Because people are flawed and invested in themselves first, it is hard to get cooperation from all sides to do something about a polarizing thing like climate.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Support	a lot to digest there.  I think just having a Government who don't just make stuff up would be a good starting point! 	nationalise the water companies
__label__Attack	Why couldn't you directly comment on the newspaper? How is a different platform going to really help?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Support	We need to express ourselves as the public.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Support	All very good and valid points, i am in total agreement with PriceP. Very well put.	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__Attack	everyone should be entitled to free speech	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Attack	Hate speech is not the same  thing as criticism. Criticism should be respectful and objective.	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.

__label__Attack	I agree, this has been seen on platforms in the past. This article about an online horse game shows an example of a moderation team going a little 'mad with power', being more harsh when dealing with mentions of politics they personally disagree with (banning people who mention being LGBT but not banning those saying similar things which imply them to be straight) https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2020/3/21/horse-isle-3-war-crimes-and-lgbtq-visibility-a-case-study-in-how-not-to-approach-community-management	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	Disagreeing with someone doesn't mean that I want to fight them, it means we have opposing opinions, so I think it's totally possible to disagree in a subtle manner.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	On the other hand it also eliminates the chance of reflections or beneficial  interactions within the audience 	"It is hard to actually define the ""offensiveness"" of a statement. "
__label__Attack	People may feel as if they are being silenced.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	People can have constructive debates and confront serious issues without using hate speech. Filtering hate speech will not stop debates.	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.

__label__Attack	"I think it depends the level of ""hate speech"". This is very undefined and to subject it to the same level as a crime in ""the real world"" is a bit extreme. Otherwise I do agree moderation of what people say on social media is needed"	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__Attack	I think that once you go down the route of cancelling comments, you run the risk of an almost dictatorship position for the newspapers, to be able to say what they like with no comeback from anyone.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	Well then what is your proposition	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach

While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of 'tracking people down' for 're-education' for the sin of offering their opinions online (even if said opinions are quite obnoxious).

__label__Attack	Who now gets to determine the criteria, and what is topping them from being bias?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But what can be done about it? Will anything be done even with a report button	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__Support	I think this is true and there is no need for spiteful comments to be made and ruin someone's day.	All the posts should be checked before being posted and verified by some sort of AI. Hate speech could affect a person's livelihood and mental state

__label__Attack	the public should be able to give their opinions, if you try and stop it they will always find a way to make their voice heard and this is when thigs could get nasty with hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Agreed - it's technically simple to ensure that any website that allows public comments, can be linked to verified accounts. The government were thinking about doing this with adult sites - why not with sites that revel in hate speech.	We need people to supply their personal details in order to limit hate speech
__label__Attack	It is not possible for some people to ignore hate speech, and the effects can be extremely harmful - for example: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	i agree with this. although i believe that freedom of speech and hate speech do not have a visible line. thus someone may be hiding behind the guise of freedom of speech but spewing hate rhetoric.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__Attack	Even with proactive communication, some stakeholders may still feel their concerns are not fully addressed	We need to proactively communicate and address public concerns early
__label__Support	Strongly agree, people who are expressing their fear of censorship should consider the risks that hate speech create for groups of people. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__Attack	Free speech should only be allowed if it doesn't infringe someone else's right, like hate speech does.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Attack	I disagree, I think there is no difference on both platforms.	Comment sections are meant for social media platforms. The newspaper can post on a platform such as twitter in order to get comments - while disabling comments on their own platform.
__label__Attack	Some hate speech might actually be illegal, it should not be kept (https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime)	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.

One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics.

The best way is for comments to be screened as that would still allow opinions to be shared while ensuring the safety of all readers
__label__Support	Absolutely right, we are in the hands of corporate business man. But we can change this situation by changing our lifestlyes.	yesss I agree
__label__Attack	In principle a great idea, in practice this requires more money be spent on moderators and system updates	Moderate the comments sections!

__label__Attack	one-tone approach	As much as it might seem an attempt to constrict expression of thought, I agree comments should no longer be allowed. It always turns into argument and insult. We already know that for every opinion someone else will take the opposite view. A newspaper's view is its own, so let's keep it that way - we already know which way they lean politically. Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.
__label__Attack	Moderation can be timely and expensive and then you wouldn't see comments in real time	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted  to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__Attack	We already struggle to prosecute rapists what makes you think cyber bullying takes priority?	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech

__label__Attack	Moderators could be biased on subjective in their opinions.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	This is very sensible.	you should autoban key hate speech words

__label__Attack	This would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Attack	There are a lot of moral issues to consider when talking about things like population control. Issues like these have been in public policy for decades without a solution.	I feel that climate change is happening on some level, but question how much of it is due to a natural cycle and how much to human activity.    When it comes to stopping pollution and protecting the earth, I am on board.   Where I draw the line is using climate change as a platform to implement socialist policies and take excessive freedoms from people.

__label__Attack	This raises several questions: • Does exclusion matter? • Is investing time and resources in creating a genuinely inclusive environmental sector well spent and why? • How can this transition to an inclusive sector best be brought about?	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.

__label__Attack	It may not be elimination, but reduction is better than nothing!	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	It would be irresponsible for newspaper publications to not police comments as they are giving the platform for people to voice their opinions. Them turning a blind eye to hate speech could be mistaken as them endorsing or condoning those utterances. The following article serves to support my stance and should you wish maybe you can take a second to read though it. https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	Some opinions may be trigger ing to others	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	Issue with time and who gets priority for arguments	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Attack	Labour will change the UK into Venezuela	I don't think any of them know what to do anymore, they all just make empty promises. 
__label__Support	Newspapers should remember they is freedom of speech	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice. 
__label__Support	I agree that AI moderators offer an ideal solution. I think it's worth considering that having human moderators would mean that there are individuals who have to read through hate speech regularly. This research article provides more detail on this point: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/09/220916112424.htm	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__Attack	Free speech is very important, but newspapers also has a responsibilty to ensure hate speech is not spread through their comment section.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	I dissagree, it should be a safe space for everyone.. people have a right to disagree but not use inflammatory hate speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Not exaclty, you can't talk in a way that hurts other people	Leadership in the OU should allow everyone to demonstrate leadership capabilities - it is not about hierarchical positions, anyone can be a leader
__label__Support	Implementing these can have a favourable outcome.	"In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check ""users"" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help"

__label__Attack	Comment sections have become so ingrained in the news website experience that their removal will at first seem almost an affront to free speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I also don't think the removal of a comments section will make them take further, alternative action.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I agree. The BBC has previously been reprimanded for only having one side of the climate change debate speak (denier vs scientist). The public should receive multiple points of view in a way that is balanced and evidence-based.	hate speech is a reflection of two sides of a story ,all side of the story need to be published to allow the public to make up their own minds .

__label__Support	I think that is a good way to go as it means posts can be checked before they are posted online so any posts that contain hate speech can be filtered out, whilst some may argue this goes against free speech and the right to free speech, I think when it comes to hate speech this is justified.	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__Support	This is silly, AI is always built with the bias of its creators	Develop AI which is able to detect and delete hate speech automatically.
__label__Support	Good idea. If it is clearly laid out what constitutes as hate speech then there can be no argument on whether or not a comment is deemed as such.	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial.  Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.

__label__Support	Agree, they have lost their way, no better than Labour, woke on speed	The government should be focusing on taxes to help improve the econamy

While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree that Comments should we posted then flagged by the public. If it has a certain number of flags it should then be reviewed.

__label__Attack	Population experts expect that the world's population will plateau in several decades without any coercion.

__label__Support	I agree, because not all comments will be hate speech, some are positive.	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__Attack	removing the comment section will drive traffic away and decrease the amount of time readers engage with the newspaper.	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts.

__label__Attack	On the other hand if platforms are held accountable, they may prefer to remove all comments sections, so as not to be punished  themselves.	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__Attack	We should all think before we comment freedom of speech does come with responsibilities	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	That fundamentally isn't the case. I really recommend that you read their manifestos and think more carefully about that	Yes, so many people living on the bread line.
__label__Attack	A website having the ability to gain enough personal information on you is dangerous. This is  dangerous for anybody whether their comment was hate speech or not. Hackers and third parties can gain access to that information.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	How are we in jeopardy? The earth has made it this long, it will continue that way.	I think that growing more trees can reverse the adverse effects of manmade climate change.

__label__Attack	Human bias would still be at the very core of this moderation, but then again humans build algorithims too.	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that.

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	unfortunately the net zero cult would be happy to have us living in mud huts if it meant less c02 even if every other country rightfully isnt doing it 	No, thats your mum.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this. I don't understand how much more it will take before humans do something to make significant changes. We are often reactive instead of proactive but in this case our efforts will most likely be to late to significantly alter the course we are on.	The rising temperature causes all the problems .The human cause of climate change is not disputed by any scientific body
__label__Support	You can always talk in person freely or private conversations	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I think it demonstrates clearly how often AI struggles to detect hate speech or misclassifies innocent content as hateful - it would just further restrict freedom of speech.	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?
__label__Support	This is a good idea, as it eliminates the need for a moderator to sift through every single comment but rather they only need to look through comments that have triggered the bot. Then, they can make a decision on whether it has truly conveyed hate speech or whether (less likely scenario) there is human/bot error in the process	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__Attack	I have to disagree with this, as giving an opinion that is opposite to the other person's opinion is completely different that using hate speech to deliver the message. You can have free speech and hate speech banning at the same time working together. Using AI to spot hatespeech keywords, while still allowing people to argue and have different opinions, as long as they aren't doing it the wrong way.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	The EU is already quite good at foresight, but implementation is challenging	Reducing animal agriculture could harm biodiversity in some areas
__label__Attack	If the accurate information is given.	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Attack	If you only hear things you agree with how can you grow and develop as well as develop your position so that it is defensible when its challenged	Newspapers should be a pleasure to read and not make you angry after reading comments not having comments will make them more pleasurable to read again.
__label__Support	I agree to this	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	Sadly not everyone can be polite enough to express themselves without the use of hate speech, hence such people should be blocked as we cannot tolerate it.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	The negative aspect would be how moderators are going to decide whetehr it is a hate crime or not. Manupliating the moderators could be an issue.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3490499?casa_token=HD2SvDug2z8AAAAA%3AXgh7WUUzUa2Cds1w5IJne06EuRiURjtvsFfK11EK47XvumejDowcjPntDfEhpDSy3mTmiJYVsg	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__Support	too many hate words	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful. We obviously can not control what people do but by filtering the comment section we can limit what people can and can not say.
__label__Attack	This is bad for the environment and also limits some people from reading news, even if free.	I don't think this is possible. We should go back to physical printed newspapers.
__label__Support	yes, there is a reason why poorest uk families hit the hardest cost of living crisis 	lets stop the madness of climate change restrictions.. I love my DIESEL engine :) 
__label__Attack	Perhaps but a well defined policy by the newspaper should be able to indicate what is and is not allowed	Short answer is you can't, as the term 'hate speech' is incredibly vague, and can differ from person to person.
__label__Support	I somewhat agree with this.  I can't see what real changes there will be. 	Very few could disagree, however, be careful because Labour are not going to be the saviours.  There's going to be trouble.  Give another party a try ... couldn't be worse than the two main parties.  They are second rate human beings out for themselves with repetitive rhetoric and an inability to answer questions.
__label__Support	I agree with this, it should be encouraged especially around political/social issues but moderation is definitely key	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Completely agree	Can we define immigration? Illegal/legal/refugee/essential services workers....Other countries have much more migration than we do
__label__Support	Hate speech is removed	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Surely it is possible to have a free exchange of ideas without resorting to hate speech. There must be a  level of basic human respect that can be maintained.	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	some people wont like being told what they can and cannot say	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__Support	then you are just living in an echo chamber with no opposing views	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I disagree but I still overall would do this	Government should impose some rules on the people to protect the environment . It may say every one must use electric vehicles, every home must have minimum no of trees grown to counteract the man made damage
__label__Attack	It will filter out how people truly feel which defeats the purpose of freedom of speech	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__Support	The root causes of the problem is not people commenting on newspapers, but how these ideas got into their minds. We need to work on education.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I don't know who your party is, but if they have changed, why do you feel you owe them loyalty?  They probably aren't the same as they were say 20 years ago 	Because zero hour contracts aren't good for people who want to work full time hours. A mortgage advisor is hardly going to think you are an ideal buyer.
__label__Support	I agree because the masses are suffering, due to bad economic practices by this current leadership and poor immigration policies 	Kind of agree. I'm at a stage where it's all talk, I don't believe any of them, don't trust any of them and just because there's one thing that's good, doesn't mean I'm going to condone all the negative stuff that will come with it! 
__label__Attack	Newspapers have a duty of care to the reader so they should be vigilant	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Arguably it could be in the newspaper's self-interest to police hate speech even if we say that it's not necessarily their responsibility, as moderation of comment sections has been shown to reduce perceptions of bias of the article itse lf (see e.g. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1356861)	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	But to what extent should free speech be allowed? Should we as a society allow people that say hateful things against a particular ethnic group, race or gender all in the concept of 'its free speech, you can say whatever' I think that people are able to practice their rights but as soon as it starts becoming oppressive or infringing on another person's right, that is where we should start drawing a line.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	I agree with this as the comment section will be filled with hate speech that could be upsetting for some	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is dangerous because words have power and can influence others to act. It is the denial of acts of tolerance, inclusion, diversity and the very essence of human rights norms and principles. Addressing and countering hate speech is, therefore, a necessity	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	How can the classing system be done, through examples?	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech

__label__Support	This goes beyond just technical issues, it is also a matter of civilization for the general public to show it cares about fellow citizens with disabilities. 	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious 
__label__Attack	Stripping perpetrators of the right to post is very appropriate as it takes away from the individual his desire to promote his views.	Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments. However to stop people from expressing their opinions is creating another problem altogether. Those who aren't able to make help contributions should be blocked and stripped of their right to do so.
__label__Attack	Population experts expect that the world's population will plateau in several decades without any coercion. Educating people about effective means of birth control and social responsibility could have some effect of speeding the leveling of the population sooner.

I feel that climate change is happening on some level, but question how much of it is due to a natural cycle and how much to human activity.    When it comes to stopping pollution and protecting the earth, I am on board.   Where I draw the line is using climate change as a platform to implement socialist policies and take excessive freedoms from people.
__label__Support	I don't think there are any	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .

__label__Support	That people can write hate comments	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	This is a good way to monitor comments	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is some fairly clear definitions, particularly around race and gender [https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech], so it really shouldn't be hard to identify clearly offensive comments directed at a person or group of persons, over valid criticism. The only danger is if the moderator is also biased and does not like an opinion, but in these cases, an independent review will clearly show an abuse of moderator power.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	removing the comment space completely would allow people to focus solely on the content of the news and not allow people to provide their comments, this might give people the chance to be completely objective and just focus on what is in front of them instead of them using the comment space as a place to vent their frustrations.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Attack	It's up to the reader to consider what is true and what is untrue. I think newspapers could do more to provide guidance on how to evaluate the reliability of sources.	I think I would prefer to see that comments sections are removed rather than untruths being pushed at people.
__label__Support	I agree, and I think it's best to ban some words that will offend people. I also think the users who are trolls should be banned early on to protect the comment section.

__label__Attack	Regardless of training, unconscious and conscious biases will be introduced regardless as the moderators are human.	i agree that moderators have their uses but then unless they are trained properly their biases may creep in
__label__Attack	Some would argue it removes their right of freedom of speech. Despite whether it is of hateful intent or not.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I am not sure who is responsible for enforcing the legislation?	We need a better country for our children.
__label__Support	agree a real punishment.	Same although i think there will always be element of them being in it for themselves 
__label__Attack	I think this should be done by a real person, as using a computer, some hateful words can be disguised and still get through	Hate speech can be controlled by blacklisting keywords on the search engine of a particular blog post/newspapers which will delete any comments that may contain any of the blacklisted keywords.
__label__Attack	I agree with Richard in so far as newspapers to this point mostly haven't had very successful moderating systems. Either they are unaware of current methods of spreading misinformation or they bring down the ban hammer so quickly that it makes their comments confusing	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__Attack	This might overcome some problems, but would be hard to remove subtle or 'disguised' hate speech, if only working on word triggers.	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not

__label__Attack	I don't agree. There are too many people who shouldn't have access to the Internet. They hide behind their PC screens and writes a lot of things they would never dare to say in reality. They believe they can say everything that comes to their minds when they can hide behind a PC screen, and that lowers the quality in the comments section. And there are laws against racism and other topics than they can use as triggers.

Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__Support	Major societal changes that will impact on all members of society are needed if we are to tackle climate change.

__label__Support	Reduces free speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	"Your post contains the argument, ""Newspapers should cancel comment space because it can create... fake news."" I don't think this is particularly convincing. By that logic, newspapers and news websites themselves should be cancelled since they will periodically create ""fake news"" - sometimes not due to malice but rather by an honest mistake [or journalist incompetence/ignorance]. Ben Goldacre, for example, runs (ran?) a blog called, ""Bad Science"" and a recurring motif was journalists failing to accurately depict scientific insights. We could argue that their exagerrations and mistranslations could be construed as ""fake news"" but there's no malice involved. The journalists weren't trying to deceive anyone. The solution to getting closer to an approximation of truth is not to remove an entire avenue of communication, but rather to open up (regulated) communication in the hopes that the arguments that are most cogent rises above the rest - and that the logical wheat be separated from the illogical chaff.  That is to say, I think we need a better system than just, ""let's get rid of the comment section."" It's a tricky problem, no doubt, and a perfect solution may not exist. But we should not let ""perfect"" get in the way of, ""good enough."" In a subsequent post, I detail ONE possible method that incorporates several solutions previously mentioned (and as I write this post, I thought of ways to improve it further. Not perfect, but perhaps good enough)."	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	I agree with you, online privacy is already a massive issue, I don't want to have to submit even more personal data (that could end up sold to advertisers) just to comment on an article. I also don't think 'tracking down' people who post hate speech online is practical or achievable.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Support	This is a great approach that requires public funding too, to avoid wrong retro-fit choices to be made in heritage sites.	Inconsistent application of planning policy and conservation guidance means that improvement proposals meet with widely different and unpredictable responses in addition to delays caused by the strained planning system. 
__label__Support	I agree, this gives people the option to learn from mistakes before handing them a more severe punishment and that would be banning them or removing their comments	There should be moderators of the discussion, people who use hate speech should be informed of what is problematic about their comments, comments should be deleted or they might be hidden but you can open them and read the moderators comments. If educating is not helping after first attempt, person should be restrcited form further discussion.
__label__Support	agree needs lots of focus	cost of living
__label__Attack	I believe those algorithms are not programmed to dealing with hate speech. Otherwise, social media would not be as toxic and emotionally as it is	As already demonstrated by other bigger social media companies, algorithms often contain and reinforce the negative biases of its creators, so I'm not sure how effective they would be in detecting and filtering out hate speech.
__label__Support	I agree it really is up to the publisher to include comments. I don't believe that not allowing a platform will reduce hate speech.	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__Support	The NHS and Education need alot more resource and funding 	I wish we had done now , knowing what we know but were protecting everyone the way we were told to do.
__label__Support	Often people are just looking for information and news anyone.

__label__Support	Newspapers are read by various demographics and have different types of people from different angles reading different ones, so a comment section does seem like it shouldn't be necessary	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Do you believe that a newspaper comment section is an appropriate system for dialogue with someone spreading hateful messages?	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__Attack	The right to free speech doesn't mean there should be no consequences for hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Agree - all schools need to make pupils aware of views and faiths that might be different from their own. Greater awareness generates better understanding of others and harmony.	i do not believe that any incoming governemnt will change too much, as I have already said, honesty is no longer an issue, just tell people wha they want to hear, and do the complete opposite 
__label__Attack	The newspaper has the duty of educating and informing the public. One-sided articles should not be allowed as they fail to give a full perspective and may even spread misinformation, if there commenters are not allowed to correct or add a new perspective.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	i dont think being able to use hate speech, racist/homophobic language	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I find your view hateful.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites. A newspaper must responsibly manage its public platform, and giving platform to hate speech is a problem it can manage. A newspaper is, by definition, not a forum.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	Freedom of speech comes with a responsibilty, and if people are not responsible with their rights, there should be measures put into place to fix that	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__Attack	hate speech is possible	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Give option to delete bad comments	we need to stop coment section
__label__Attack	it is important for media to be criticised in order to validate it we do not have to accept what is written	There should be no comment area in order to limit hate speech. Newspapers should be one-sided sources of information.
__label__Support	Conservative have broken that trust for the general public. Covid was obviously handled terribly but also the attack of set group with policies.  There is no really way to gain respect back after everything.  	These are key points- our country is going downhill and we need change to make it a better place.

__label__Attack	anyone writing things against the prevailing narrative will be shut down. George Orwell wrote this would happen and women would be the ones easily taken in and become enforcers.

__label__Attack	I don't think everything should dumbed down, I think people should try to learn what is happening 	It could increase democratic legitimacy
__label__Support	i do get your point, some hate speech does get severe, which is what should be removed, i think some should be removed from root, and yes some topics need you to talk about them	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	Yes, another way to only limit hate speech is to remove anonymity. Therefore, certain sites can require those to sign-up with their bio and this is verified by moderators. Someone may think twice about being 'hateful' if there are repercussions.	newspaper might remove comment section as a way to prevent hate speech. however, it does remove freedom of speech to those who would like to express themselves through comment section.
__label__Support	This is a fair point -- maybe removing the influence of comment sections altogether will stop the trend of news increasingly becoming 'comment' and being less objective in reporting. If people want to exercise their free speech about the article's content, they can still share the article and express their opinions on it elsewhere, like on their personal social media channels.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	I agree we need more council houses	Trust in politics
__label__Attack	Whoever creates the algorithm then ultimately decides what is hate speech. There need to be a common neutral definition of what hate speech is before any kind of censorship algorithm can be developed.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Attack	people will find a way to comment horrible things elsewhere in newspapers	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__Attack	Whilst this isn't a terrible idea for this issue if everyone in comments sections is discoverable this could be very dangerous and turn what is a purely online hate problem into a real hate problem. Many people online have talked about issues with stalkers and being doxxed and this could make the problem a lot worse.	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__Attack	Does not give diversity to the story.	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__Attack	depression and peer pressure should really call out to ones morals and values as a human being.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Support	I completely agree - I frequently don't comment because I expect that I will accidently unleash an off-topic argeument by people who just want to cause trouble.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	Moderators also have bias	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals

__label__Attack	This doesn't stop the issue of trolls creating a new account and commenting again. The internet makes it too easy for people to spread negative ideas.	everyone should be entitled to comment and have opinions but the comment section should be checked and hate comments deleted and that user blocked on the website
__label__Attack	I don't think the intention is to be aggressive but sometimes expressing yourself may lead to saying things that hurt other people.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__Attack	Freedom of speech does exist, and every user has the right to say what they wish. Where is the line drawn in regard to this discriminatory content?	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Free speech should be entouraged but newspapers should have more responsibility to moderate	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__Attack	"""Most listed buildings have been there for long time. You have to guarantee a modern building there to remain for a long time as well, but can you do so?"" (Anna Beckett)"	we shouldn't be worried about ai because it creates jobs regardless if a lot of people lose their jobs
__label__Support	Yes I agree, I feel that we are probably fairly used to sifting through the rubbish on the internet, and at times the trolls can be entertaining, as long as it isn't nasty.	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.
__label__Attack	Surely this would depend on the opinions and ideas of the moderators in some cases unless they followed some standards such as what the UN outline here on hate speech... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.
__label__Attack	I respect your opinion, but there are loads of more pressing issues than that!	We need a better country for our children.
__label__Attack	Although free speech is important, there is a lot of scientific evidence showing that hate speech, bullying and dehumanising language can do harm to individuals it is aimed at.

__label__Support	too much time is wasted arguing and scoring points off each other rather than making a difference in our country	in what way?
__label__Support	Exactly. Just ignore the hate speech. Like in real life you just ignore the bullies	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Reduced number of readers because of the cost of purchase.	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__Attack	I don't think blocking key words that in the majority could only be expressed in a hateful way would give them unilateral power. it is possible to do this under instagram posts and I dont think the majority of people would even notice	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	I agree a screening process could be effective in filtering comments.	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__Attack	just because readers comments should be allowed does not mean that they should not be filtered within some capacity to prevent hate speech and discriminatory comments	"The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of ""cognitive dissonance"" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context."

__label__Attack	Free speech is the cornerstone of democracy - it can be political but it doesn't have to be. Democracies should protect those that are vulnerable from abuse online whilst also preserving the spirit of free speech.

__label__Attack	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.

__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I agree but in reality, it is hard to carry out. It would require newspapers to work with law enforcement and there may be legal issues with the sharing of people's personal data. You also run the risk of this data being stolen or sold to groups or governments that should not be trusted with such data.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious  consiquences
__label__Attack	Everyone has a right to free speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I agree to remove it and that opinions should be on the third party sites.	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__Support	I agree, making it harder for hate speech to be posted through filters etc makes more sense than to remove a space where people can have genuine discussions.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Support	Totally agree with this and hopefully most rational people would.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	More to it than that, but yes immigration definitely provides a lot of staff for our public services. Mismanagement is a big issue, hundreds of millions of pounds are wasted	Difficult to define and include truly dissenting opinions
__label__Attack	all criticism cannot be considered hate crime, sometimes it can be the harsh truth. How can we make sure these comments don't get deleted too.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Attack	Would this not limit freedom of speech then ? people wont truly speak their minds if its being filtered first. Moderators would be given too much power ?	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__Attack	As much as I would *like to* agree, I unfortunately cannot. Free speech still IS a part of free speech. I'm afraid you can't have one or the other - they are co-dependent as I believe, humans are inherently seeking conflict.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I think the comment space should be monitored by the newspaper for a more standard approach, because a lot of people have subjective views on what hate speech could be.	Newspaper websites can have an option where other people could report the hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	I believe that newspaper articles know the consequences of any article they put up and the kind of comments that may arise from such, it is therefor their responsibility to prevent such from occuring.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.

AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__Attack	I believe moderation should occur instead of total removal to allow people. to express their views	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	This can hinder the increase of hate speech by filtering out the hate words	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Support	Yes, the welfare of the masses must be well attended to.	Taxes, environment, healthcare, immigration
__label__Support	It's their arrogance that really gets to me. They have all these scandals, all these screwups, and then try to tell us that they're the only party that can handle the problems the country faces, many of which they're responsible for. They act like they're born to rule 	i think its the cost of living and making core costs affordable so public can manage
__label__Attack	They may edit out valid non hateful comments that are just not their views	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__Attack	some mistook freedom of speech for spreading the hate speech. Some root causes of hate speech originate from child hood traumas and are deep, i do not think that we may be able to tackle those just for the comment section hate speech.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I agree with Dominic , who becomes judge of what is true, what is without bias, what is hateful versus what is simply disagree, disapprove, dislike. Do we say happy things only and simply create artifical safe spaces where only positive ego boosting comments are allowed?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	Guidelines could be very useful to set up rules for what is and isn't allowed on the website. Then, everyone has a clear understanding of the moderator's goals and reasonings.	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.
__label__Attack	No offence but no one is stopping anyone from being proud of their heritage. I'm British and I've never felt like I have to say sorry for everything either. 	too few houses built over the last 30 years and when immigration is the size of birmingham every 2 years

She is married, able bodied and has a 9 year old daughter. Yet she choses to work one day a week as she has four horses and cannot look after them if she works full time.  Why does she get UC to fund her one day a week work with the DVSA? 
__label__Attack	Less people sign up for account	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__Support	more online platform needs a moderator role, too often you see posts on social media that have rampant hate speech going unfiltered and the commenter going unpunished	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__Attack	And how exactly is the government supposed to stop this? 	Probably not. Most elections are really a case of trying to pick the best of a bad bunch. 
__label__Attack	Humans have very little effect on what can be done to eradicate such a large problem. Yes every little bit helps, but how can the poor people afford to pay the extra for environmentally safe products, etc such as electric cars.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	This would surely reduce discussion. People should be free to contribute without having to give up their privacy.	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__Attack	Slow process. Subject to flaws if misinterpreted by moderators/other commenters.	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!

__label__Attack	This may lead to insensitivity to other readers	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	newspapers can turn off the comment section, leaving people with their own concerns and comments	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Attack	You rely on readers actually flagging inappropriate comments and not just comments that they don't like	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	I don't agree with handing over a lot of personal data as this could be misused and seems like an overstep of personal freedoms and privacy	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I disagree, people that use hate speech are fully aware, especially if it is related to a newspaper article.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	I believe the comment space is a place where people get really involved and there is a chance for healthy discussion. However, this is not always the case.

__label__Support	I like the idea of controversial opinions still being available to see other perspectives, but not being forced to see them if you don't want to.	There should be moderators of the discussion, people who use hate speech should be informed of what is problematic about their comments, comments should be deleted or they might be hidden but you can open them and read the moderators comments.

__label__Support	I like the idea of auto-moderation to automatically screen out comments with certain words that are considered hate speech	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.

__label__Attack	How can we draw the fine line between hate speech and freedom of speech?	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__Support	I don't really think that any of the posts above really do touch the matter of this one so I can't really think of anything else to my argument here. (Evaluation as asked)	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally

__label__Attack	hate speech doesnt allways include certain hateful word so wont work in all cases	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__Support	I think that it should be the responsibility of the news outlets to ensure that comments are fair and accurate.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I absolutely agree. The first sentence sums it perfectly!	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__Support	No alternative views	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	this is going to cost a lot of money!	The cost of living is diabolical but I don't think that any of the parties will correct it. I agree that Scotland should be allowed to have another vote on independence.
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

__label__Support	Yes, the most easy way to make sure that people don't spread hate speech any further would be to educate people on the steps that should be done before posting any of your opinions. https://www.thecommentingclub.co.uk/sharing-your-opinion/	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Attack	Media isn't about sparking debate it's about catching our attention, profiting off our attention and sharing their biased view with us. Some countries have tighter regulations for media than others as well, plus they write salacious headlines for sale knowing people won't always read the full text of the article. They cause the polarization in conversation.	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__Attack	People are entitled to freedom of speech and shouldn't have their views taken away from them	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__Attack	But humans are humans and some abuse these priveleges  by posting what they like without considering the consequences.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__Support	Yup. More people want more ties with EU now than ever, but a stranger to the UK would be hard pressed to know just by reading the manifestos. 	We need people in the UK to actually be helped back into work to realise they can earn more money by working than on benefits. There are enough people to make a difference without so many immigrants.

It's not like the UK public expect them to to everything but what's the point in making promises to win the election and then not keeping to any of their promises?
__label__Attack	I love the idea of implementing a filter/moderator so the respectful opinions are still allowed to be shared!	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__Support	Allows space for other perspectives to be published.	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__Attack	Based on this article which i agree with, it is essential for humans to have the freedom to express their opinions.

Governments do not want to give up control of what makes them rich and fossil fuels make many governments trillions of dollars. If you think they will give up this cash in favor of climate control you are sadly mistaken. As long as money means power we are doomed AND THE POOR WILL BE THE FIRST TO SUFFER.
__label__Support	People should be allowed to give their opinions because where else will be able to read how people feel about certain things happening around other than comments. I just think they should be monitored and taught to not post hateful comments.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	The disadvantage of having free speech it causes people to think it is Ok to bully, lie or name call other people and this causes more chaos and leads to more hate which is not the path that most newspaper websites want.	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__Attack	Care must be taken not to accidentally block users	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__Attack	It is too dangerous to allow everyone and anyone to say exactly what they like, there has to be some rules in order to protect people.  It's a form of manners that we expect from each other in every day life, and should be no different just because we are online saying something.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Absolutely! With the current developments in technology we have enough tools to reduce hate speech without eliminating space for readers comments.	Registering with ID is the single step that would improve incidences of hate speech in comments section. That coupled with live moderation either by AI or human, and following rules that can quickly adapt to change should greatly rduce hate speech.
__label__Attack	It's true that hate speech is discriminatory and can constitute violence, but not all comments on news platforms are hate speech, and some are constructive. People should be allowed to share their authentic views on a subject, as long as those views do not discriminate against specific groups of people.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	yes. if their going to make money from individuals, they should also suffer the consequence of creating a safe space for them.	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.
__label__Support	Has to be this. Anyone but the Tories (and Reform but they have no chance)	what an idiot the lib dem leader seems

__label__Support	Its not just the cost of living though, it is the massive gap between rich and poor. 	The boats need to stop coming over  
__label__Attack	Hate speech is a nonsense concept.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	Physicist Stephen Hawkings  warns that we are close to the tipping point, but climate change can be reversed if the human race acts now.	Today the growing population is struggling to live with the available resources as it is not sufficient to meet the demands of the people , so they have to interfere with the nature and exploiting it .

Neither of the main parties have given us reason to trust them, and even if smaller parties can be more scrupulous there's no point voting for them in a GE. It's all very frustrating. 
__label__Attack	Nobody should have to see it regardless.	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.

__label__Attack	are they not all the same, none fit to govern or lead	Bottom-up approaches have more legitimacy
__label__Attack	Hate speech can be damaging. Removing it also gives the platform more professionality	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.

__label__Attack	It may limit potential information which could be spread in ways of educating people.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	yes, the lack of consequences is the problem. We can see from somewhere like facebook where peoples info is so easy to find that people have had negative consequences over their hateful posts so clearly being able to link back the comment to the person can help	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__Attack	Changing the age of teachers is not the solution to education system problems	The education system needs to be reformed to address challenges posed by social media and AI
__label__Attack	Also there are skills gaps.  We should be training more people eg for NHS roles but that won't happen overnight and without non-UK nationals we would be stuffed 	I believe that whilst we all want solutions, I honestly don't think any party has the capability to achieve.
__label__Support	I agree. It's also a good way to give a second chance to a person in order for them to change their behavior. And maybe help them understand that they are writing hateful thing, and educating them in a sense.	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	I agree, as people need to be made aware that sometimes, what they say and think could offend other people.	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__Attack	How will it be worse than what is already happening?	Whilst I agree that maybe immigration is an all time high however what I dont agree is Rwanda deportations, there should be a better system in place (ie skill shortage which we currently have) or give people opportunities - what I dont agree is the abuse of a system. Im an immigrant myself (16 years moved here) and opportunities are betetr especially in a career im at (stem) and theres a massive shortage of it and if people want a better life this shouldnt be held against them

__label__Support	it feels right	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__Attack	yes but we seem to be letting the worst of them who are not wanted in their home countries - most are comming for the money and not to try to integrate or make britain a better place	NHS, Housing Crisis, Cost of Living
__label__Support	If we try to make a serious attempt we can definitely reverse the harmful effects.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	agreed, the media hypes up levels of immigration. 	The NHS and social care, together with the dire poverty in what is supposed to be a first-world country, are priority issues which should be dealt with immediately. Climate change will take much longer to address, but we can make a start now - but cannot expect solutions within one parliamentary term.
__label__Attack	This is simplistic and would be very limited in its effectiveness.	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__Attack	Although the idea of having AI is quite a good one. How accurate will this AI be in detecting hate speech?	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__Attack	Free speech cannot just be cited at every occasions when the comments people make are criminal. Free speech is not an opportunity to break the law.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Labour haven't said anything in Scotland about stopping SNP? 	Immigration has gotten out of hand as has the cost of living 
__label__Support	I completely agree, everyone should have the chance to give an opinion and also agree or disagree with the points in an article, however there is no room for hate speech.  The best way to achieve an ability to comment on online newspaper articles and websites is to allow free speech but to regulate comments so as to avoid nasty hate speech, people then making such hateful comments could then be blocked from further comments.	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__Attack	Newspapers don't have an interest in this	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__Attack	A legal framework is needed to ensure  that media outlets don't censor speech on the basis that it is opposite to their views, with the justification that it was hate speech.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	The government should build more houses, and give more money to the NHS 	national security
__label__Attack	no use to rejoin the EU, we would be the ugly cousin. stay a sovreign self governed nation	I'd like a full focus on the NHS.  Help support our healthcare professionals.  Not really bothered about immigration.
__label__Attack	Moderation can be seen as restricting free speech.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Trolls don't really care about anything but trolling so trying to reason with them is futile.	By simply educating people about what harm hate speech can do to a person
__label__Support	"This an argument that I agree with. I do not believe there is a consensus and I have little confidence in the ""science"" that supports man's heavy influence on climate change.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I don't necessarily disagree, but solutions would include funding the planning system better and requiring LPAs to have conservation advice, both of which would aid early engagement and head off the development of proposals that are likely to be refused. Substantial energy efficiency improvements can be made for most buildings, including listed ones, without planning permission or listed building consent. Concentrate on quick wins.	because yes
__label__Attack	Surely these platforms could just end up filled with people who don't care about formulating a justified argument and post fake news instead. How do you monitor who is allowed to comment?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Support	I agree with this comment. I really would encourage people to educate other people about the consequences and reasons behind hate speech. These factors might contribute to reduce it	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	Freedom of speech	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__Support	I agree with this, or some coding introduced in the background somehow to not even allow bad comments/words to be posted at all.	There should be some filters to remove bad comments

__label__Support	I agree, while I'm advocate for immigration, I feel like we really need to reign it in as we're struggling enough as it is.	The cost of living has got out of hand and the big companies are making big profits from us all.
__label__Support	I agree with the main idea, but people who spew hate speech aren't exactly open to being educated.	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!

__label__Attack	I simply do not agree with your views Andrea. How can anyone living, or wanting to live in a democratic world want to actively curtail free speech in any form.

They have optimised for big business only and it hasn't worked.	Whilst I agree that maybe immigration is an all time high however what I dont agree is Rwanda deportations, there should be a better system in place (ie skill shortage which we currently have) or give people opportunities - what I dont agree is the abuse of a system. Im an immigrant myself (16 years moved here) and opportunities are betetr especially in a career im at (stem) and theres a massive shortage of it and if people want a better life this shouldnt be held against them  
__label__Attack	eliminating space for readers comments wouldn't be a good idea on my own opinion there's people who genuinely wants to give good comments and there wouldn't be space for them to.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	I think that is an excellent idea, perhaps using some form of AI could be used to cut down costs.	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__Attack	This is impractical for high traffic websites that will receive thousands of reports	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__Support	A lot of thorny issues there. It's possible that the Putin-Ukraine situation could escalate, and if so, that really becomes the most important thing of all.	I'm really angry that the personal tax allowance has been frozen for so long (for everyone). Not sure any party has committed on that
__label__Attack	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Support	I agree!	Agreed - The party is represented by their candidates, and so many of them have vile political or personal  histories.
__label__Support	I would largely agree that free speech is arguably more important than eliminating hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I believe everyone has a different threshold to how much hate speech they can handle. Some might take offence to things that others may not.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__Support	I agreed with Brexit but it was a lie. We need to renegoiate agreements and go back in on new terms, learn from the past mistakes, but we are going back cap in hand so it's not going to be easy.	Economy, NHS, immigration and inflation.
__label__Support	I agree that we have to try. There is no quitting.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year

__label__Support	Completely agree! 	Pledge to support NHS, pledge to support workers and workers rights, pledge not to raise taxes
__label__Attack	The moderator needs to not be too strict	There should be moderation reviewers to delete harmful comments
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	This limits free speech and reader engagement	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech should be always encouraged	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Support	Getting the Tories out is the first step towards a better and brighter Britain - not sure Labour can achieve that but whatever anyone says, they're still the better option over Conservatives by a long shot. 	I don't think any of them know what to do anymore, they all just make empty promises. 
__label__Attack	This solves one problem - no one can then be  offended	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Evidence from research (see attached) suggests that the comments section of a news article is better at creating discussion than outside sources, so comment sections in newspapers is important for nuanced discussion	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section.

__label__Support	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed? (In order to avoid publishers becoming reliant on retrospective fixing, rather than their initial checks - which are where the problem originates).	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__Support	Blimey, a chance? 14 years not a long enough chance?	Where is the money going to come from?  It is a mess!
__label__Attack	I have heard some users fear this. For instance, those who post anonymously about their sexuality or gender in countries where they may face issues in cases of hacking/user info being made public.	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__Attack	Would that be enough?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	Yes to the sex based rights - I can never vote for a party whose leader does not appear to know what a woman is	Is anybody disgusted with the restricted choice of parties we have to vote for..I personally don't really want to vote for any of these clowns
__label__Attack	This argument doesn't consider the ways in which certain kinds of speech can suppress other kinds of free speech. If hate speech is allowed to run rampant, this silences and threatens minority speech out of existence.	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not. If you don't like free speech then go live in China.
__label__Support	This would reduce hate speech and overall help to ensure a promote positive environment	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__Support	Yes I agree but I can't see which party is likely to address that - they all toe the fashionable line	totally understand your position, I also considered this (I've always voted) 
__label__Attack	there is a distinction between comments that are made directly in a discriminative way and comments that create a dialogue.	Key factors include ethical point of intervention along with just mere word filtering. Because sometime the message that was thought to be sent across might be pure but because of wrong choices of words, it can get filtered out. 
__label__Support	I would love to think that we could screen every comment written about every article but it is simply not realistic. Removing the platform that gives power to hate comments is the best solution. I understand that people want free speech, but i do not see this idea manifesting seamlessly	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__Attack	I disagree. This limits the freedom of speech of people and for people to be able to give their opinion and potentially challenge the thoughts of the newspaper. I agree that this should be done in a respectful way.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Privatisation has been a disaster for everyone except the shareholders. 	They have run this country into the ground in my opinion, cut police and NHS funding, crime rates have gone up, illegal immigration at an all time high, cost of living crisis.

__label__Attack	I agree over-censorship is a negative, but there are laws about hate speech that should be upheld.	The is no need to moderate comments they must be dished out raw as they are writen by the readers
__label__Support	no one can afford to rent a flat or house on their own now 	Information alone is not enough without education on how to use it
__label__Support	Yes 100%	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__Attack	prevents people being upset,	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I totally agree. Freedom of speech is very important, but if it goes too far and it becomes online harassment, then it's time to treat it as a criminal offence.	"""Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the ""casualities"" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved."
__label__Support	I share the same opinion on that having a bot that can check for hate speech is the way either block users who use hate speech or put them on time out.	The comments could be checked for hateful speech. For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.
__label__Support	Agreed. Beholden to leaders based off the votes of another country, and then leaders of said country tell you you're not even allowed a democratic vote to leave said voluntary union. 	Better foresight could help prepare for crises
__label__Attack	Most readers don't know that comments are turned off https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship.

__label__Attack	The irony was nice, but for the debate it confuses more than clarifies ideas. So your opinion was a hate speech? If it was, should it be here? Otherwise, why it was removed?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	Training AI to do that would be a great way to prevent this phenomen	i think by just censoring specific words that are hateful/derogatory this could then automically screen out hateful comments that are abusive - i think it should be judged on what would be an offense to say in person. This could then use humans to read and monitor comment boards and then train AI to further do so
__label__Support	I agree with this. It's important for the newspaper to know how readers feel and react to the content	I have no real interest in reading readers comments sections in newspapers, but I don't agree that they should be eliminated. The content can be moderated to remove hate speech. This be done by a moderator, or these days, by AI.
__label__Support	Eliminating the space for comments entirely will mean that each article is viewed through the lens of the journalist. This is not completely impartial but it does mean that harmful speech or radicalised opinions aren't present to muddy the waters	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Attack	Taxes are a good thing: how do you think we pay for things we all need, like the roads, transport, the NHS? 	something defnitely have to be done to the NHS, but further tay raises is not the answer. It's the whole system the issue. that no one doctor can make a decision, it has to go through on several different levels etc. and just makes so much longer
__label__Support	Yes, a slow and deliberate decline.	more should be done to stop us wasting energy and water
__label__Support	I agree that moderators are all too often bias one way or the other so only extreme hate speech should be censored.	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__Support	You make a good point - why do we need to give a platform for people to just say mean things hiding behind their computers when they wouldn't say that in real life.	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__Support	https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/06/role-education-address-root-causes-hate-speech-and-advance-inclusion-non	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	Absolutely the main issues	Yes I agree this is absolutely huge, but we need to reposition it, not make it so doom-laden as it turns many people off. There are opportunities for green technology, get ahead of the energy transition etc. Small changes by lots of people make a difference.
__label__Attack	visit stop the tories to see who your tactical vote is 	Let's hope they win.
__label__Support	this can also be dealt with by having moderators who can filter fake news out/highlight the correct facts and refer to more up to date stories if relevant	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Attack	That would be very helpful	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__Support	I agree we can work to prevent it, but systems can be complicated to introduce or can be controversial in themselves	realistically hate speech cannot be eliminated but preventative measures cane be put in place to minimise its presence
__label__Attack	I like it but i worry it would just be ignored. Just removing a comment isn't much of a deterrent	"A pop-up can be used which reads ""if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments""."
__label__Support	good way to make a point	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	it would make sure that very offensive comments could be either moderated or removed	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__Attack	I think sharing ideas is ultimately beneficial and having a space to do this can help form stronger opinions. Hearing different sides of an argument and different perspectives help ensure that we are considering many views and not hyper focused on one narrative that may not be the reality of other people.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	I dont mind this but we cant ignore the fact that there are company who are spreading so much pollution and greenhouse effect just for profit. We need to reprimand them as well.	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Support	I absolutely agree that people need to have an outlet to share their opinion, whatever that is. And the only reason to really turn comments off is where someone is seeking information, and have their answer/are satisfied with the response; but on a news site, I feel like blocking comments is a cop out for a controversial story, or to protect the sources feelings rather than giving the public a right to have a say.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__Support	It is very difficult to police all the contributions	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__Support	Algorithums	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	most people dont bother to read more, they just look at the quick soundbites without thinking if they are fake or not	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	i believe that people know what is wrong and what is right. they do know when their comments are harmful	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Support	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation. United States. Social media platforms have broad latitude [PDF], each establishing its own standards for content and methods of enforcement. Their broad discretion stems from the Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law exempts tech platforms from liability for actionable speech by their users. Magazines and television networks, for example, can be sued for publishing defamatory information they know to be false; social media platforms cannot be found similarly liable for content they host.	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__Attack	terrible idea!! look how bad brexit was, power in numbers and scotland doesnt have the economy to survive and the SNP are as corrupt as any party	nhs waiting lists, cost of living, palestine, education
__label__Attack	"I partially disagree - perhaps 'aggressive' is too harsh a word for what I am trying to convey but newspapers have to take action here, and in some cases it needs to be very severe action. Example here with the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/04/21/comments-are-making-the-internet-worse-so-i-got-rid-of-them/, who say: ""Comments are making the internet worse. So we got rid of them."""	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	not focusing on the interconnection between free speech and hate crime	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__Support	I agree with this, as the issue of moderating newspaper comments also crosses the gap into social media where most newspapers will post their articles too.	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech

__label__Support	Some newspapers already don't have comment sections on certain articles which they think would attract harmful comments or trolls.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I support this, moderation should be visible.	More Admin and block buttons
__label__Support	Name and shame those that want to spout hate, I agree.	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__Support	Well thought argument. But most people are over 18 years old and are deliberate in spewing hate its unlikely that they will be re-educated if they have chosen to be bad apples	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	But it also means that the newspaper will have full control over what is being posted and can filter certain opinions as well as hate speech to create a biased community look if they want to. Since they would never go on air, there would be no history of the page you can compare to.	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)
__label__Attack	I disagree that newspapers should be one-sided providers. Newspapers are often aligned to certain political parties, and that is not necessarily made clear! Readers may not realise they are reading biased news stories.   Comments should be allowed so that alternative points of view can also be aired.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

Possibly	Left-wing extremism has taken hold of many of our institutions, to the extent that many people no longer view it as such.
__label__Attack	disagree, chat feature is useful	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	maybe get something to control what comes in and goes out	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I disagree. Democracy cannot progress if others are punished for the misdeeds of a few people. A headache simply will not be solved by cutting the head off. Other devices such as comment monitoring and elimination can prove useful.	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__Support	Would benefit society more in long term.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

__label__Attack	I do not agree that it should be allowed to be there at all.

__label__Attack	passing legislation on free speech is difficult especially in countries with entrenched codified constitutions	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online

__label__Attack	this is true opinion is important	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__Support	It can be fooled by the writing of the bad word, like in some social media.	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Support	Even a simple thing such as re-entering regulatory alignment with the EU would help with imports and exports# 	Investment into the construction sector. I'm not aware of any party having a strong stance that they will incest heavily (and intelligently).

__label__Attack	Newspapers ARE these platforms, or should be, in my opinion. Why not allow news to be challenged in the place where it is presented? Why risk leaving it unchallenged?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	it does indeed,  I doubt most MP's know what the word means	The thing is that parties like reform are very good at persuasive speech and knowing what to say but telling what their true beliefs are rather than what theyre saying jjust to make us like them is difficult!
__label__Attack	Will still allow some comments which could be seen as offensive	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__Attack	"I absolutely agree with that position. As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that. Also - hate speech is not illegal in most countries. Quote from Wikipedia: ""While ""hate speech"" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment."" Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States"	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	get rid of the admin staff who block change and improvements in systems and processes   they are the ones at fault  not the government 	Agreed. It must be ringfenced and protected like the triple lock on pensions with minimum guarantees 
__label__Attack	Whilst I agree that maybe immigration is an all time high however what I dont agree is Rwanda deportations, there should be a better system in place (ie skill shortage which we currently have) or give people opportunities - what I dont agree is the abuse of a system.

__label__Support	Simpler communication can help citizens better understand and engage with the EU	Measurement alone is not enough without action
__label__Support	but the amount of comments is what puts too much of a strain on moderators	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__Attack	Does not allow for positive feedback	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	It can limit hate comments	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Support	I agree with this too!! 	couldn't agree more that the party elected needs to be in touch with the average person 
__label__Support	Comments are still there for free speech.	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__Attack	being ban or warned has the first step	Again I think that removing comment sections entirely would overall be a negative thing. Yes, there are people who abuse the comments section and it they can use it to promote hate speech, but with the right tools this could be moderated. Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning
__label__Support	agree - need to reduce waiting lists	why not?

__label__Attack	In an ideal world perhaps, but how would you recognise 'hate speech' and police this in practical terms without infringing civil liberties and free speech. AI offers one avenue, but many challenges remain and there are many risks with this approach: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152	If eliminating readers comments is out of the question, then it must be that hate speech is recognized and removed before a comment is even published. People use the free speech argument but free speech isn't 100% guaranteed in cases of speech causing harm (e.g. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre). Hate speech causes harm.
__label__Attack	It's lack of investment in training. We can't keep letting our country poach other people's trained doctors and nurses to save money.	Difficult to define and include truly dissenting opinions
__label__Support	I completely agree with this and this might also allow journalist to engage with their readers. I found this study to be really interesting about how the majority of journalists that were interviewed found values in comments.	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__Attack	Reform are racist, bigoted, and have no real plans that are actionable	What will take place tomorrow will be theatre. The problem is the system as a whole.

__label__Attack	Our NHS is on it's knees due to the lack of immigrants.	Difficult to define and include truly dissenting opinions
__label__Attack	some people may have different ideas for regulation	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	It isn't perfect but it is a pretty decent %	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__Attack	I disagree - these policies must be mandated otherwise when they are voluntary (like in the UK now) people don't wear them - as a result infection rates remain high 	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	AI may also let hate speech slip through the cracks.	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/

__label__Attack	Im not sure what the poor has to do with it	I think that if we don't do something to start combatting climate change today, literally nothing will be there in the future to worry about - no economy left if there's no livable Earth left to inhabit. We're going to have to address this at some point, why not now? I'm not convinced that we can reverse what has already been done (ie, extinct species), but we can change the course of the future. 
__label__Attack	eliminating space for readers comments? is that the right approach?	WEBSITES BREACH FREEDOM OF SPEECH by eliminating space for readers comments
__label__Support	Yes, I agree, needs more funding and better rights for NHS workers including those that come from overseas	Also they all seem to spend all the time having a go at each other instead of telling us what we need to know about what they are going to do and how they are going to pay for it.
__label__Attack	Hates speech does not automatically equate to freedom of speech. In fact, often times it is a violation of many human rights. In that case it should be removes so as to protect the people that would otherwise be harmed by those hateful comments.

__label__Support	Newspaper websites may remove comment areas if they wish. Having moderators or allowing only subscribed comments are also options that may work. They just have to be careful on who decides what is hate speech and what is fair comment.	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__Support	hate speech will be reduced	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__Attack	Crowdsource moderation is a great idea, similar to reddit where people can vote, but there are still moderators who can remove posts completely if they break sub rules	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	That will just give newspaper websites the opportunity to publish fake news without anyone challenging them (https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/journalism_fake_news_disinformation_print_friendly_0.pdf). for example, if they post fake news about covid, no one will challenge them and anyone who doesn't have enough information will believe what the article says.

__label__Support	It is very very concerning how so many people seem to have developed short-term memory loss (for the last 5 years) when it comes to the shameful, insulting, disrespectful actions of those who are in-charge of our well-being as a nation	How can trans rights (bio men) be more important than bio females when talking about womens rights? birthing people? chest feeders? bonus hole? bloody ridiculous
__label__Attack	Hoping that they may publish is wishful thinking as well unless they have a system for it.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Attack	making individuals aware	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Attack	5478e52cfdf99b5322cf7f7b The war in Gaza has very little to do with us. I support giving aid to Palestine and selling defensive weapons to Israel but what is the electorate of a country half way across the world meant to do to sway this conflict? 	Also a lot of waste
__label__Support	Totally agree with that, I can see Trump taking advantage	There are way bigger issues than this, the government are not able to do much with this unless they enforced rules such as no driving for all population. The best way to help environment is to recycle yourself

__label__Support	Free speech should never be curtailed.  But how due you suggest you address the root cause of the problem?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Right to free speech isn't necessarily a right to a platform or a publisher. Before the internet, people weren't entitled to have their comments on the news stapled inside a copy of the paper. They were just able to express their opinions on it independently, to family or coworkers, or by writing their own publication in response. I'm not sure if newspapers simply choosing not to publish readers' comments (which is what they are doing by hosting those comments on their site) is the same as censoring free speech. By this logic, anyone who writes a poorly written opinion piece and submits it to the New York Times should get it published, because otherwise their speech is oppressed.	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__Support	there should be notifications when someone is discussing with yr opinion LOL 	I am not sure if this will happen 
__label__Attack	We cannot adopt but we should adopt to it because there is no other go with the affected environment unless helping the environment  less pollution	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Automatic filtering technology can be improved continuously and I think it would reach an adequate level of censoring without limiting freedom of speech. Some social networks like Instagram already give an option for users to select if they want to see hate speech or not  
__label__Support	I like the idea of 'repeat offenders' being noticed if you will. It means people can't abuse the system as easily	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.
__label__Support	Agree, need a fairer distribution of resources. But are Labour bold enough to tackle this? 	"Focus on the NHS and genuine issues.  No need to hear anything about ""woke"" issues as they aren't important!  Focus on supporting families, reducing energy buills"
__label__Attack	I'm not convinced this is a helpful input in its own way.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	these are important issues to me	Yes, I agree that the rich really need taxing, the Greens have it right there
__label__Attack	it is their responsibility, albeit partially	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	People with genuine hateful intentions will not change because of this.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Support	testing with slide, somewhat agree	"BASEd ON: ""I think that would like to read in the newspaper that, all the elected at European level are young people with a majority of women."", Person36 "
__label__Support	Completely agree with what everyone has said about immigration needing to be reigned in 	The cost of living has got out of hand and the big companies are making big profits from us all.
__label__Attack	5478e52cfdf99b5322cf7f7b  Better a boring leader who carefully considers the options and outcomes  than the last few years of utter chaos.	There are way bigger issues than this, the government are not able to do much with this unless they enforced rules such as no driving for all population. The best way to help environment is to recycle yourself 
__label__Attack	I disagree - these policies must be mandated otherwise when they are voluntary (like in the UK now) people don't wear them - as a result infection rates remain high	I believe that mandatory mask-wearing policies infringe upon personal liberty, and that mask mandates are politicized and are manipulative tactics by certain politicians and special interest groups as ways to increase state control
__label__Support	I absolutely agree. It's newspapers responsibility that these comments do not end up in their comment section.	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	Technology can help. Planting trees can also help but isn't the single solution. We need to simultaneously adopt many strategies and methods to fight climate change.	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Support	not a bad idea	have an AI to scan and analyse trigger words, then the alert is passed to a human reviewer then can say whether or not it's hate speech
__label__Support	True and in my opinion the right to freedom of speech should trump any counter argument.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Yes, I agree and they seem to think that we all want tax reductions when I would ather the money was spent on helping the NHS, etc get back on its feet.	Student loans are another big issue. We are saddling our children with debt as Universities are entering a financial crisis of tgheir own
__label__Support	Definitely. The current system is a joke and the Easyjet flights to Rwanda will actually land just outside Bournemouth	You and me both, these are rights that we should have access to in our country (the sixth wealthiest in the world!) 
__label__Support	I agree that we need to rebuild our relationship with EU and vastly increase housebuilding. I think rejoining EU won't happen but realistically the single market instead (as much as I would wish we were still part of EU) 	I'd like a full focus on the NHS.  Help support our healthcare professionals.  Not really bothered about immigration.
__label__Attack	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__Attack	Breach of free speech	"Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech. ""Fight back against harmful messages in public places by publicly standing with victims in solidarity"" https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-onlin-hate-speech/"
__label__Support	Exactly, if not mandated there's also a strong negative social pressure effect where many people who are actually in favour of wearing masks don't dare to do so because of fear of being the social outlier or even treated aggressively.	I believe that mandatory mask-wearing policies infringe upon personal liberty, and that mask mandates are politicized and are manipulative tactics by certain politicians and special interest groups as ways to increase state control
__label__Support	"imagine if we'd said ""not our problem"" during WWII. What is going on is the world's problem "	Lots of politicians are a bit out of touch with actual reality
__label__Support	if we the individuals dont try then who are we to tell the chinese 	Other issues directly affect me, other countries pollute far more than ours does 
__label__Support	it is not going to be helped by the choice of candidates in the US	poorly worded I admit, I meant how those who have immeasurable amounts of money are able to get away without taxation while the rest of us are so harshly punished 
__label__Attack	You are aware that ethnic minorities can be racist?	Views on Gaza and what's best for Scotland
__label__Support	I have never supported one particular party, I only voted for who I think the best (or least worst!) person is each time	Those are key factors for me too but unfortunately the major parties have not really about them! 
__label__Support	Do you mean the shadow cabinet minsters as well? As they seem not to serve any purpose.	They have the clearest strategies of all the parties. Please read the manifestos!  
__label__Attack	Am sorry but what works for you does not work for all. 	an absolute hail mary to the baby boomers. It'll be 'Bring back the death penalty' next 
__label__Attack	However it should be note that the AI should not be programmed with inherant biases of the programmer(s)	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__Attack	this already exists on certain websites and you can still easily view hateful comments	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__Attack	Yes, you can have your own opinion but that doesnt mean you have the right to spread hate.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Higher food prices could negatively impact consumers	We need to ensure fair prices and income for farmers
__label__Attack	Newspapers are nationally available.As are there websites.Whilst newspapers cant be held responsible for the comments of its readers ,i do think they should have a moderater to delete harmfull posts that could offend.	Hate speech will always appear on open forums.  The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__Support	I feel something really needs to be done to help the NHS as well, it's supposed to be the pride of the nation	But first and foremost you have to agree with what theyre promising
__label__Support	While I agree that it is getting harder every year, we need to do something about it now. It's never going to be an easy process, but the sooner we start, the better. We need to make drastic changes now so that policy and consumer interaction can be at the level necessary to move things in the correct direction.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__Attack	What???	We need a better country for our children.
__label__Support	Yes there should be restrictions in the form of vetting comments before publishing it	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__Attack	I'm not sure if AI could function well enough at this time for this to be the final answer.	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__Attack	Who is to say what is or isn't 'harmful'? It sounds like you want to control a good chunk of the population who don't agree with you on things.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	no it wont	living with covid will need much new investment in primary care
__label__Attack	I don't disagree that we have a problem with housing etc, but I don't feel comfortable with centering on overpopulation, as what does this mean for a solution... depopulation? And what does that lead to? That becomes an uncomfortable place	I worry for those that are less fortunate than I am 
__label__Attack	"As much as I agree with you that everyone should be able to express their own ideas. The internet is full of trolls who are constantly usung hate speech and without any guidelines or moderation. It's quite impossible for there not to be any ""aggressiveness."""	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	In the other hand, if we don't try to do something then we lost allready 	Exactly, if not mandated there's also a strong negative social pressure effect where many people who are actually in favour of wearing masks don't dare to do so because of fear of being the social outlier or even treated aggressively. 
__label__Attack	I think by promoting the hate speech it very much takes away the meaning of the subject. You dont need to be hateful to agree/disagree with something. You can be constructive in your approach and this will have a greater impact on the issue and cause for a logical debate between people. So an element of policing is required	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Essentially agree on all of these plus add the NHS and social care	making sure to vote to give conservatives a chance
__label__Support	It is true, there is freedom of speech, all readers should be able comment on what they think	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__Attack	Time consuming	Strict content moderation
__label__Support	yup. we're doomed. if you think the Tories are incompetent, wait until you see David Lammy and Angela Rayner trying to run things.	100% agree
__label__Attack	I disagree people need to show what they think about what has been written	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	I think some avenues are being made to increase LGBTQIA+ rights but perhaps not quick enough. Cost Of living has just got out of control and those costs aren't going to come down.  it will take a few years until peoples salaries catch up and prices have been stable for a while until the pinch lessens and I doubt any government will make a huge difference to this as their goal will be to keep inflation down. 	make the ministerial code stronger with harsh penalties for breaking it
__label__Attack	It would require more time and effort	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__Attack	Yes I agree many people are able to not get aggressive over a newspaper topic, however there are plenty that do, and allowing full expression of opinions without monitoring and consequences could lead to people being offended or bullied	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	cost of living in a big city will always be high no matter where you are in the world. Simple case fo supply and demand 	Every time I go to the supermarket, I feel like I'm spending more and more 
__label__Attack	anyone could have a problem with another persons point of view	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious 	it should target the insulting and violation to individual and groups right by law or common morality  
__label__Support	I agree with this	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	humans are not usually biased	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are! 
__label__Support	I've found the same, whereas our Labour MP lives here, his kids go to school here, and he really shows up in the community 	I think over the past few years the UK has become bit of a joke on the world stage. We need to build up our credibility again for sure! 
__label__Support	"""There are many people who can help with that"" (Esther Robinson Wild)"	People will become dumber. 
__label__Attack	newspapers are biased - they don't reflect balanced opinions	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	This goes beyond just technical issues, it is also a matter of civilization for the general public to show it cares about fellow citizens with disabilities.	We need a minimal set of protection measures (masks, ventilation...) in public spaces and public transportation.
__label__Support	"I agree to a certain extent - like Wikipedia, if anyone can contribute then there is no way to validate what's been said, and it can create ""Fake News""."	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	fully agree - there is zero trust in out politition across the scale	Cost of living is way too high, also re-privatise the Rail lines, Gas, electric, as these are run by greedy big companies
__label__Attack	That could help, although that would take a long of time. Also at the end of the day, whoever writes hateful speech do not see the dangers of what they are doing. According to an article in The Guardian, some people think this is just the internet and it does not reflect true life.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Attack	OR we can try a a semi-automatic, holistic approach. I mean, it is important to let people talk about what they want, the comment section is an important place, where people can communicate. But some kind of moderation will be always needed. I find this study interesting: https://aclanthology.org/W18-4420.pdf	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Agree, moderation is the way to go, as hate speech should not be part of any media forums.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	It doesn't give a space for hate speech	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	"In addition it would be helpful for there to be some form of data tracking to identify ""repeat offender'who go around spreading  hate speech consistently."	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__Support	I think wanting honest policions, the cost of living crisis and the NHS would be most people's concerns	Agree too much waiting time 
__label__Attack	Most newspapers are inherently biased so you can't really trust them to handle hate speech	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__Support	agreed 	There are way bigger issues than this, the government are not able to do much with this unless they enforced rules such as no driving for all population. The best way to help environment is to recycle yourself 
__label__Support	Trolling is human nature, it will never stop so measures need to be placed because this problem will never change unless people change.  https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I think it is part of the responsibility of having a website. If the newspaper is not listed as a +18 platform for using insults or hate speech, then young people would be affected.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	the website could give raise this this awareness and have a open discusion	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	It's not the funding its the inefficiency and waste of money. Why can't you return your crutches when finished with?	True but the same could apply to the Tories too
__label__Attack	Not very mature of an arguement	Inequality yes- but regarding what exactly?
__label__Attack	By eliminating the entire comment secion you would be getting rid of the freedom of readers comments	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Absolutely agree with this - so many people affected by it, we need prevention and treatment	How come you won't be voting?
__label__Support	Taxpayers will have to pay	The economy, defence, education, the environment, who would be a strong leader
__label__Attack	It'a difficult to filter abusive comments	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	https://www.unia.be/en/areas-of-action/media-and-internet/internet/how-to-deal-with-hate-speech	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.
__label__Attack	There are those that are going to use the platform to incite hate and this should be moderated with them being banned if identified	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship.  I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it.  Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.  Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy.  They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__Attack	They can already do this, take a look at social media policy and they can, but choose not to in fear of going against freedome of speech.	I think that there should be techologies that are able to scan and the comment section to detect and flag any offensive/vulgar words in the comments before the comments are published.
__label__Attack	I am pretty sure some sort of hate speech itself is an infringement of ones human right and somehow defies what democracy stands for so it still does not lead to the necessary democracy either	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	This will go against the purpose of public opinion. Public opinion is informative and sometimes educational	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	How it impacts everything we do from the weather and the heat to storms etc 	investmen tin people
__label__Attack	I agree, this is a very measured resoonse.	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__Attack	The fact is that the knowledge on climate change is still very limited. Assumptions that we make about the damage today could be disproved tomorrow. Take for example the holes in the Ozone. We discovered them with advances in technology, but no one is really sure that we caused them or even for how long they had actually been there. With advancements in technology there is little reason to believe we can't reverse some of these things.	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Attack	We have had the same crowd in charge for 14 years. Time for a change.	There's a labour shortage right now and the adult social care system is heavily reliant on migrant labour. Migrants are also less likely to use the NHS and other public services than non-migrants 
__label__Support	I agree that with the current level of technology there is no problem as to monitoring comment sections for offensive language. This can be easily removed.	"I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about ""A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments"" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm"
__label__Support	i agree with this, for there to be a clear definition before you post, not terms or rules in small writing	First, it would be important to define what hate speech is so that readers that want to post comments have a chance to self-modify their posts. Secondly, having a filter that will automatically block posts that contain proscribed words could also help to reduce the amount of hate speech featured in comments sections.
__label__Support	Heavy moderation by the newspapers could prevent people being able to post their opinions	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__Attack	It really depends on what type of personal data is being shared. I strongly believe in privacy because people can be crazy.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Tougher sentencing is needed, too. 	I agree that these are the most important issues
__label__Support	yes. I totally agree. They are so corrupt	I agree-having recently been in hospital, I was shocked and saddened by the state of the NHS
__label__Attack	Nothing will change. It never does	Our country is a mess 
__label__Support	Saves having a human moderator soft through hundreds of comments.	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__Attack	True, but people take freedom of speech and it gives them the right to say whatever they want, without fear of persecution	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I think with people reading less newspapers both hard copy and online, Print subscription circulations have fallen by 7% over the past two years, from 125 million overall to 116 million, while single-copy sales are down 11%, from 3.2 million in the first half of 2019 to 2.8 million in the first half of this year.17 Dec 2021, the papers are not going to give the time and effort to monitor the comments sections when there's nothing in it for them.	I believe that all types of hate speech should be removed. All comments should be pre assessed by an overlooked before comments are posted. We should still be able to comment and have freedom of speach to express an opinion, but no hate speech.
__label__Support	i agree with this completely	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Integrity does seem to be in short supply	The thing is that parties like reform are very good at persuasive speech and knowing what to say but telling what their true beliefs are rather than what theyre saying jjust to make us like them is difficult!
__label__Attack	I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated, but I don't think that it requires the total removal of space for comments, as the comments add value. I believe that moderation is the way forward.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Would probably be very hard to actually do anything about people posting hateful comments	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Support	I agree - the NHS has been wrecked by the present Government and is being privatised by stealth to the detriment of the NHS	Conduct of Tory government in office, illegal immigration, policing of 'non-crime hate incidents'

__label__Attack	Crime against people is statistically lower than it has been for a long time. This just isn't true. Have you ever been a victim of crime? 	Agree, I called 12 NHS dentists in Leicester and every one of them said no chance, join the waiting list
__label__Attack	Who will moderate it? Can local papers afford to hire people to moderate every comment?	Moderation of the comments section
__label__Support	Agreed, possibly the worst, lying incompetent and corrupt political party to form a government	I agre Brexit is a disaster but no party is going to tackle that. A referendum on rejoining the sngle maRKET? a PRIATE MEMBERS BIL MIGHT DIO IT?
__label__Support	While this would eliminate all hate speech, newspapers would not implement it, as the interaction drives hits on their site, so the comments section is an essential part of spreading the news person to person	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	But with freedoms we have to consider the repsonsibilities that come along with those. Your frredoms dont give you a right to infringe uopn anothers right by discriminating agaisnt them. Majority of constituions talk about freedoms and right but we cannot be only selfish and forget about anothers right to freedom and dignity.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	We shouldn't have to see it regardless.	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__Support	I agree that most if not all online news articles do not need a comments section. However, I believe having a note to tell readers to be well mannered would not stop readers from posting hate speech if they had intended to do so in the first place.	By not providing comment section not unless the article need their opinion. There'll be a note notifying readers to be well mannered.
__label__Attack	time consuming	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__Attack	True, in detail without being disrespectful or bullying	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I definitely agree on the part of sciencing valid criticism	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	who do you think can turn things around? It is definitely needed 	I know the conservatives have been awful over the last 14 years but it seems people have forgotten how much worse previous Labour governments have been 
__label__Attack	I agree and as stated in this article (https://www.impactplus.com/blog/no-comment-why-companies-continue-to-move-away-from-comment-sections-on-their-website) it is possible to see that some websites actually already deleted the comment sections. They turned out to be quite useless as mostly trolls were commenting, while no interesting discussions were there anymore.	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.
__label__Support	I believe having the ability to read through the comments of other is very important when making decisions. The fact that monitoring is weak across most platforms is the biggest issue.	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__Attack	We need to start somewhere as people will just carry on if nothing is done	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Attack	That was COP25, I believe in this discussion we are trying to focus on COP26 	I agree
__label__Support	with you there!! 	I do think that Covid hugely affected the NHS and this would be difficult for the government to fix overnight (in addition to the funding crisis). 
__label__Support	Young people can be eliminated, who are likely to hate speech because of lack of information.	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__Support	I agree that it can be very challenging. But what good is it to just give up. We have to at least try to make change, no matter how hard it can be. We just have to learn how to make the right types of changes. 	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	Agree, and to be held accountable for their promises 	my rent doubled 18 mths ago and new contract means it will continue to rise, it will never go back down. Plus I have no housing security.
__label__Attack	Disagree because the rate at which suicides are happening due to	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Companies will make more effort in regulating online presence if they are held accountable by law	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__Attack	Communication alone is not enough without systemic change	We need to improve communication and engagement with consumers
__label__Support	"I think this is good and supports freedom of speech, but at the same time, we cant really control ""aggressiveness"" in people especially considering that the degreees of acceptable aggressiveness varies with each person"	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I was once asked to consider being a politician and my answer was, I can't because I am too honest! So yes, not surprised any politician is 100% honest...name one who is if you do know of him/her/they	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!
__label__Support	I agree, it should not be removed but rather directed	Everyone shoould be able to express their own ideas but we could have some kind of protection in words the should not be allowed and also have a way to keep moderators on the website, people could be warned that they are doing something wrong and be explained that there IS NO HATE SPEECH and be offered maybe some way to express herself without hurting or damaging others.
__label__Support	unfortunately it is just pure greed, rent has gone way past being affordable now, caps work in lots of other countries, so theres no reason why they cant work here. Buy to let mortgages are at such high rates, thats why rent is so high. Greed by the landlords and greed by the banks 	It could increase democratic legitimacy of the Commission
__label__Support	I completely agree. It's not the job of online sites to become speech police. I frequent many different online comment sections, and oddly enough, hateful comments are swiftly dealt with by other contributors. Sometimes the best way to eliminate hate speech, is to allow it to be seen, then vastly condemned by those seeing it.  Algorithms should be used to deal with trolling. Honest, sometimes brutal comments should not censored just because they make others uncomfortable.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	how do we mute these comments? Cencorship?	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__Attack	Removing the platform is a preferable one	By monitoring individual responses and removing those not deemed suitable for publication
__label__Attack	couldn't agree more. We should eradicate homeless. 	I worry for those that are less fortunate than I am 
__label__Attack	Discussion will always happen. This would encourage discussion to happen elsewhere in forums without direct reference to the news article or without any moderation. It also pushes discussion into social media platforms where discussion tends to be more polarised and less productive.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Yes, this is a very crucial point. Something which is hate speech for a particular ideology might not be so for others.	I agree that positive communication will be important - perhaps that starts with us working through not only areas of consensus but also identifying some of the fears / assumptions around which disagreements foment? 
__label__Support	Yeah. That's true anyway. Freedom of speech is good but protecting the citizens and preventing violence through hate speech is also great	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	we will not hear other peoples opinion, so this is not a good idea	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Posistive for who? One of the reasons for comment section is to promote socialising amongst readers not just or the newspaper itself	lts true hate speech should be taken as positive criticism
__label__Support	This allows for people to understand that something will be done if they conduct hate speech.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	I feel like we somehow need to be a little bit more specific on which tools could work, because many times it could also be difficult to set limits in what can be said and what not. I would say that we could use a sort of algorithm which can recognize offensive comments and delete them.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Automatic filtering technology can be improved continuously and I think it would reach an adequate level of censoring without limiting freedom of speech. Some social networks like Instagram already give an option for users to select if they want to see hate speech or not	A key factor that could make filtering unfair is the fact that is done merely by automatic detection tools without human vetting or control. 
__label__Attack	The Israeli side is not ready to engage in real political negotiations	Communication with consumers is challenging due to activist voices dominating the discourse
__label__Support	absolutely, punishment should be given more often (within reason of course)	The EU is already good at foresight but struggles to act on it
__label__Attack	The removal of the comment gives a clear warning to contributors that hate speech is not tolerated and that if they use offensive language then their opinion will not be heard.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	Flagging comments would be good	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__Support	Agree- though there should also be some information provided as to why a comment has been deleted. For example, if someone uses a racial slur, they could be educated on why others may find it offensive. Rather than just blocking the comment.	"Flag known and ""popular"" derogatory terms automatically through the platform which does not allow you to post the comment without using the politically correct terms"
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Yess, thats totally correct. In order to reduce hate speeches there shoyld not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I do think that Covid hugely affected the NHS and this would be difficult for the government to fix overnight (in addition to the funding crisis). 	Also they all seem to spend all the time having a go at each other instead of telling us what we need to know about what they are going to do and how they are going to pay for it.
__label__Support	Algorithms and AI are much more advanced than the common person thinks. AI is able to discern intent. It is not solely based on keywords like a primitive AI from 30 years ago.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	The best way forward would be for both sides to respect the 1967 borders	Policy changes often face resistance from powerful industry lobbies
__label__Attack	Hate speech causes a lot of issues so it's nearly impossible to ignore. As much as we may have the right to freedom of speech, we also have the responsibility to engage responsibly.	Freedom of speech is important - however hate speech is not important to debate
__label__Attack	Enabling colleagues requires agile systems and processes, or change and improvements to existing ones, within a timeframe where inspiration is still present. Otherwise it can lead to frustration.	Deliberative democracy will focus on co-creating new ideas with broad citizen engagement.

"	I feel something really needs to be done to help the NHS as well, it's supposed to be the pride of the nation
__label__Attack	I think people need to learn to manage their finances better. I don't earn a great deal of money but I am ok because I don't waste money and I spend wisely. I have a really cheap mobile phone and car - went without both of these for nearly 10 years and stick to a budget of what I can afford on food. We eat healthily - I don't drink or smoke. And I put my children first. Makes me so mad when people say they can't afford to but their child a book etc. Why -they are 10p from the charity shop or free at the library?? This is lazy parenting and selfishly wanting the state to hand out more without making any cutbacks. 	an absolute hail mary to the baby boomers. It'll be 'Bring back the death penalty' next 
__label__Support	For sure I think UK diplomacy is going to need to work over time to make sure the world comes out the other side of Donald Trumps next presidency! He's a lunatic! 	Rent should definitely be capped based on area / property type etc, it may deter landlords from entering the market but the greed on show at the moment is just ridiculous 
__label__Attack	If comments are really harmful towards certain groups of people I would rather that the provider cuts them off.	I think allowing some special space to allow it also would be helpful instead of cutting comments off.

__label__Support	the tory record across the last 14 years has been bad but the labour policies don't seem to be that different from the Tories. Local government is seriously underfunded which means services are being cut along with services and costs are going up	Crime seems to be on the rise along with lack of safety on the streets. More investment in the police  and emergency serfvices
__label__Support	Totally agree, climate and people's welfare are the big ones 	Cost of living is way too high, also re-privatise the Rail lines, Gas, electric, as these are run by greedy big companies
__label__Attack	100% The Tories have been destroying the country for 14 years now. This narrative that Rishi needs more time is ludicrous  	needs funding and making more efficient
__label__Support	it would definitely help to reduce hate speech and remove hateful language	moderating the comments would surely help
__label__Attack	Bringing Social Media into the discussion is irrelevant in my opinion. We're specifically talking about removing hate speech from newspaper websites.  The whole point of social media is to present opinions, share your life etc A newspapers website should be a place for news to be disseminated	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	the mod can even alert the authorities should they feel the hate speech warrants law enforcements	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__Support	Moral and ethical values (e.g. equality, right to clean healthy environment) shape fair environmental and social change. It should ensure that excluded stakeholders get to part in decisions that affect their environment and quality of life. 	The first and simple advice often given by one of my colleagues is “thicker curtains across window and doors” . It’s short term and achievable for residents while other interventions are in planning (John Preston) 
__label__Support	This will allow online users to think twice before spewing hate speech	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	Newspapers often weave opinion in to their presentation of the news, they don't always report just in a purely factual manner. No comment sections at all would stifle discussion.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	This should have been thought about many years ago. I believe things are too far gone to ever be able to get the planet back to normal again	"NOT. To ""sort"" climate change we need to do a LOT, and one of those absolutely mandatory requirement is to use clean energy - no matter the cost"
__label__Support	We will; eventually join the EU (or at least customs union/single market) albeit not for years.	I'd like a full focus on the NHS.  Help support our healthcare professionals.  Not really bothered about immigration.
__label__Attack	Negativity	Readers should not be given a false assumption on the understandings of others.
__label__Attack	It has been normalised that the web is space for hate talk and privacy to say anything, but why did we make this the norm. If it's something you wouldn't say in person then don't say it at all.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	encourages social participation and reflection	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	yes, but we need to motivate  their continuous participation.	This will lead to more inclusive and representative decision-making
__label__Attack	yes, and don't remove all post, just the part that contains what is termed hate speech,	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Support	Self-opinion is illogical at times, but people are entitled to whatever non-harmful opinions they like. Except in the case of psychics and other charlatans.	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__Attack	Yes people are very technological savvy and capable of using fake accounts to continue spreading whatever comments without consideration and that makes it hard to trace them.	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__Support	I agree that a change of government is needed, but realistically no other party has any valid reasoning of what exactly they will do to help. All as bad as each other! 	the winning party gets 5 years but only about 40% of those who vote back it. mostly conservatives win 3 out 4 of all elections its unfair and most people are not represented in any government
__label__Support	Technology is ever changing. Maybe what we currently have cannot make lasting change, but it can make a change in the right direction. As technology updates, we can do more. I think it's more of an issue of becoming willing. 	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	I think that a lot of comments can become personal or contain misinformation that does not really benefit anyone though.	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__Attack	it is censorship	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__Attack	Readers should be able to challenge the editorial views of the newspaper / individual journalist otherwise the newspaper just becomes an echo chamber.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	Its unlikely there will be such software that recognises all slang / racist words	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__Support	I think closing some more loopholes that are used for tax avoidance would be good if acted upon, but wealthy will always find a way around the rules I guess.  I am not sure the argument that they would all leave is true either.	The EU is already good at foresight but struggles to act on it
__label__Attack	send who? where are you getting these figures from lol 	Probably not. Most elections are really a case of trying to pick the best of a bad bunch. 
__label__Attack	It is hard to rely on awareness campaigns, as people who write hate speech are not very interested in any awereness campaing	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__Support	I agree I think we should adapt the best we can. We can't change what has already happened.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Support	allows the expression and discussion of points which could limit hate speech in itslef	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__Support	I agree. The wages increase but this isn't inline with the cost of basic living conditions 	"I would add ""Crime"" to the above and agree with these subjects."
__label__Support	A coordinated programme would be useful, but where do we start to build it? And Who should launch it?	"""E.g. floor insulation, glazing"" (Crispin Edwards)"

__label__Attack	There must be some sort of check not censorship	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	fully agree	Saw a depressing documentary about the NHS and heard doctors say there are not enough medicines.  This is because there are too many people now on our small island, so I link it all to education problems and immigration, I fear.
__label__Support	yes! This is exactly what i said	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__Attack	Banning comments only based on keywords will remove certain comments fore sure but won't help in reducing hate speech	Using tool, that automaticully remove discussions where is wrong kind words
__label__Attack	I totally agree. There are people who like to read comments. It is also a right to express an opinion.	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__Attack	The public are not experts and their views should not be publicised as such.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	as long that bot will be consistently and effectively enforced	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments
__label__Attack	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down. 	this is a comment on Bla #
__label__Attack	should be included in free speech	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__Attack	Imagine how terrible we all would feel if we made the planet cleaner for everyone only to find out it was a hoax?	Government should impose some rules on the people to protect the environment . It may say every one must use electric vehicles, every home must have minimum no of trees grown to counteract the man made damage
__label__Support	only farage will solve this :)	SNP being the only viable option for a Scottish person to vote for. Every other party's communications have focused on stopping another party, which i ffind strange as we're talking about running a country
__label__Attack	I'm not sure how voting a particular way helps cost of living, Electricity/gas/water prices are set by the companies, food prices are set by the retailers. the government doesnt control these things.	Agree fully with the NHS and economy section.  I need action taken to support my mortgage for example as it's going to almost double in 3 years when my fixed rate ends. 
__label__Support	The NHS definitely needs to have more funding and improved	Do we all agree that the cost of living is the biggest issue right now?
__label__Support	I think people take comments sections with a pinch of salt - they aren't creating fake news, they're often just expressing opinions, providing context or simply having fun.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	freedom of speech needs to be maintained whilst making sure other people's rights are not violated and people do not have to read 'hate speech' which is offensive to them personally,	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	Education only goes so far - some people will just ignore this policy. Perhaps just removing hate speech manually, or having a review process so only non-hate speech comments are published may be better.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I am not sure if this will happen 	Bring back legal routes for immigrants with speedy processing of claims
__label__Support	Agreed	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__Attack	Why? Most have worked hard for their money and paid a lot of tax on it already. Discourages hard work investment and innovation.	"We need people in the NHS who know about the NHS not so called ""managers"" who know nothing about how the NHS works.

__label__Support	I agree with this because as much as one has freedom of speech, be mindful of others and do not be disrespectful	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__Attack	quite an optimistic way to see it	Hate speech is hidden love that is just imperfectly expressed and should be protected 
__label__Attack	this would be very difficult to police, although i do think its a good starting point	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It's the politicans who are pseudo Brexiteers who weren't totally behind it that messed it up. Give Farage a chance. Can't be any worse than the ones we've had so far 	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!
__label__Attack	Why do people read comment sections? To get informed and enlightened or because they are nosy and killing time? I think most of the time is the latter. I am not sure the comments expressed at the bottom of a page bring more value to the conversation than they bring potential offence, hatred and fights started just for the fun of it.	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__Attack	Disagree, there are ways to reduce hate speech, but they need to be implemented correctly.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	The comment section should be a safe where everyone is free to place their opinion and ask question without someone making them feel somehow about themselves.	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__Support	There is a growing body of evidence that everybody - not just the vulnerable - wearing masks significantly reduces the viral load in a confined space.	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious 
__label__Attack	hate speech can be controlled by way of manual review or even bots programmed to look out for flagged words	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech

__label__Attack	This would create issues of illegibility and would only create more confusion as to the user's intent when the comment was made.	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech

__label__Attack	I think the writer can decide	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__Support	We do have to adapt and evolve with the shifting climate. It's too late to halt the process entirely.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	I disagree. I think other readers of hate speech could be influenced by it making the issue spread even further. You can share your opinions without using hate speech and with a balanced approach so it should be removed.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	But the major newspapers are already owned by large corporations who have vested interest in political parties and financial matters. It is hard for liberal or independent news to break through the noise. Comments help to balance the conversation.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I think that is a very good idea	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__Attack	There are always other spaces, such as reddit or twitter, where one can discuss articles- they do not have to be discussed on the same page they are presented	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	it would be nice if the comment could be made visible after it has been removed. others can know what to avoid and if it is NOT actually hate speech the conversation could be continued don't you think?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	i hope you realise the number of people coming on boats is tiny. The media love to use this tactic to make you hate the wrong people 	Probably not. Most elections are really a case of trying to pick the best of a bad bunch. 
__label__Attack	No hiding behind false ID	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__Attack	Education about hate speech has been around and people still practice hate speech	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	It is a good idea to not completely  remove comment sections as that discourages user interaction	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	True, creates a hurdle that some people don't wanna do	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments
__label__Support	Standards which keep users behaviour respectful towards one another should be reinforced throughout discussion boards!

__label__Attack	False information can then be removed, as well as with any comments that are harmful	monitor comments before the are posted
__label__Attack	But software is not near good enough to accurately identify hate speech all the time. Language is complex and you can't pin HS through banning or flagging certain terms and phrases only.	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between  violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I think that freedom of speech must be protected in any case, and there may be no doubt about censorship or bias relating to the political orientation of the journalistic house in question 	Diversity is important so that all sides are heard

__label__Attack	hateful opinions are not opinions	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Tasking whole units with not only moderation of hate speech but also tracking it and analysing it for trends is a huge additional workload for an already stretched sector. It sounds great, but likely unrealistic in terms of newspaper resources.	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Attack	I don't agree with removing the space for views to be aired. That is an important part of challenging and changing opinion. I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated so finding the users and punishing them is key.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	reduces freedom of speech	Having certain words being banned or marked as inappropriate might help reduce hate speech. Systems that moderate what is being said and shared and the option to report hate speech might be helpful.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is a probelm, and to discredit any potential help is not the answer. Trials and attempts could be made to fix this issue. A good way to do so would be to use human modetors who are netural, to ensure that there is fairness.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Exactly, it's a slippery slope when a system is doing all the work https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	Disagree! people should be abl eto express themselves in a respectful manner.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Efficient, less controversial	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Support	A good point, a lot of memes may be seen as offensive and may be flagged as such. There is the man I saw on the news who made a video for YouTube and made his dog do an offensive stance as a joke and ended up with prison time, it depends on how far a joke could go and the stance of those seeing the joke. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-43478925	"While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some ""memes"" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as ""memes"" containing racism and sometimes  the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230"
__label__Support	a more toward automation	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__Support	Exactly. People want to feel as if they are part of the conversation. Removing the comment section just has the opposite effect.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I agree but what is to be done about those who use hate speech? Do we just let them be? And what about the newspaper's reputation? Should they be known as a newspaper that allows people to comment on whatever they like with no repercussions?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Th Un have argued that we need to address hate crime https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.

__label__Support	It could be damaging for allinvo	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision.

__label__Support	Allows people to be able to comment on current events while eliminating the issues of hate speech	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__Attack	While I agree, there are a lot of things that have to happen first before this can become a reality. We have to rework gas stations around the country so that they have the charging stations necessary for electric vehicles and we have to build the charging stations near highways and thoroughfares for those same electric cars so that the future infrastructure is ready to handle the influx of electric cars before demanding they be manufactured at such a high rate.	electric vehicles should be consider as mandatory by the major fuel consumption nations

__label__Support	I think the idea is marvellous, it will prevent pointless comments that are intended to hurt other readers or those mentioned in the articles. If they are to be available for speculation. They would need to monitor the comment section and not delay in removing harmful comments.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Not a big issue. You're brainwashed by right wing media distracting you from the real issues 	I also agree, while the Tories have been awful with regard to LGBTQ rights, I don't think Starmer has been strong enough in rebutting them.
__label__Attack	i don't agree with this - you should be able to give an opinion if it is valid and relevant.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	The comment space gives users a way to vent out their frustration. It is not always nice to see derogatory language but when there is a healthy discussion, it helps people reading them to find very informative.	"I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about ""A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments"" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm"

__label__Attack	Hate speech is not free speech when it can lead to attacks on people and how they choose to live their lives.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Social media platforms are far from perfect at dealing with hate speech, it may even be detrimental because it would allow a lot more people to comment and therefore a lot more hate could potentially be displayed	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__Attack	I wish people would stop jumping on the bandwagon describing Reform as racists. Sure they have a few bad apples associated with them but have you taken the trouble to check out how many ethnic minority candidates they have standing	Views on Gaza and what's best for Scotland
__label__Attack	I agree something needs to be done but I'd rather our Government focused on sorting our issues out as a priority.   	Totally agree, climate and people's welfare are the big ones 
__label__Attack	blocking certain words could automatically delete comments that are not necessarily hateful to another person	I think by blocking certain terms that are hateful when responding to others in comments i.e., you are an idiot, loser etc. Hate speech should not be present online.
__label__Attack	I think the fact that Facebook, one of the richest companies in the world, struggle with moderation points to the fact that small local newspapers would struggle. Especially if one of their stores goes viral or something.	Moderation of both users and comments isn't difficult to implement and will weed out the idiots that want to ruin it.
__label__Attack	People will tick that they agree, but write what they want anyway! And if they're anonymous there are no repercussions for them.	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__Support	definitely agree with this comment,there is no place for aggression in an adult debate	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I think you are confusing hate speech with a controversial opinion. Hate speech would be saying a racist word 5 times; a controversial opinion would be that dinosaurs don't exist because of the square cube law.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Algorithms also have issues and can be inherently racist: https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/18/21121286/algorithms-bias-discrimination-facial-recognition-transparency	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Costly to the company to pay for dedicated moderators	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__Support	I doubt Starmer is going to go for this, I hope he does though, but he has been taking a lot of 'gifts' from the rich lately, people trying to get him onside.  	Yes, this is why it is so important to vote, so many people just didn't vote during brexit because they didn't think we would ever leave the EU
__label__Support	Yes they are just in it for what they can get out of it	Provide citizens with access to verified, non-polarizing information
__label__Support	the servers could store our info 	Lots of positive characteristics here! Vision and influence definitely key - and with the latter: excellent negotiation skills, conflict management, diplomacy are critical.
__label__Attack	Nothing	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Attack	If a newspaper does not do anything, it might facilitate hate speech and help it reach to millions of people by simply hosting it on their website. Therefore there is a responsibility.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Young people will risk being silenced	"Younger people are susceptible to propaganda by the establishment ""elites"", they will be easy targets of manipulation by saying that ALL opposing views are ""hate speech""."
__label__Support	You are right -People have lost the ability to debate, and think that shouting the loudest wins the argument.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	Whoever wins will need to invest a lot of money. Which will probably mean a rise in taxes.	"Yes most of them are career politicians and never had a ""real"" job outside of politics "
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

As a sector, we do our best but the Public Sector should focus on things such as the skill gap for instance"" (Chris Jofeh, Consultant to Arup and Chair of the independent Decarbonisation of Homes in Wales Advisory Group)"	Inconsistent application of planning policy and conservation guidance means that improvement proposals meet with widely different and unpredictable responses in addition to delays caused by the strained planning system. 
__label__Support	I like this idea as it contains inbuilt responsibility, so it motivates the people in power to fix it, and competition between different newspapers will breed more effective methods to reduce hate speech effectively, which other platforms will copy and adapt	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__Attack	I think using personal data would be tricky. Many companies have been caught selling user's data without consent or storing it in an unsafe way, which could harm those affected by hate speech more than those who post it	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far. Source: https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__Attack	not well explained	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech.  Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire.  In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing.  On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen.  So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Attack	The fact is that the knowledge on climate change is still very limited. Assumptions that we make about the damage today could be disproved tomorrow. Take for example the holes in the Ozone. We discovered them with advances in technology, but no one is really sure that we caused them or even for how long they had actually been there. With advancements in technology there is little reason to believe we can't reverse some of these things. 	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Support	Some of the thoughts that people need to 'clear' may offend others.	"I found this really interesting, ""Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend."" This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

__label__Support	I agree with you, i feel like thats what media is about, expressing ourselves.	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__Support	it might have a negative effect on other people, sometimes it might even be harmful	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I disagree with this because newspapers can lose readers due to poor interaction	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	I think there are bigger fish to fry at the moment. 	"NOT. To ""sort"" climate change we need to do a LOT, and one of those absolutely mandatory requirement is to use clean energy - no matter the cost"
__label__Attack	Good Argument but at the same time we must look at how it affect people live most people commit suised because of hate speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree with this statement.  All hate speech can be removed if being monitored properly.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Newspapers role is already to sell information, censorship can be done without doing comments with hate speech.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	This is true because it takes the focus away from the real news!	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__Support	Also agree that one-income households should be able to live a comfortable life for their children. There are not enough nursery places for all children so some will inevitably have to be cared for at home anyway, and parents who make that choice for whatever reason should be supported in doing so.	what does that even mean??
__label__Support	I also agree because reading what people thinks about your work or your outlet is important. if not then how could the writer improve?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	great idea	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful. We obviously can not control what people do but by filtering the comment section we can limit what people can and can not say.
__label__Attack	The hate speech will go underground and may appear in other closed forums or whatsapp groups.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	The government should be focusing on taxes to help improve the econamy	Numbers on benefits too many cut the money paid to them 
__label__Attack	It is still difficult because then you are removing everyone's entitlement to an opinion	By totally eliminating the comments section because most it kills reporters confidence and it may lead to hate speech and fake news
__label__Support	definetly needs sorting i thghink adopting australias policy with letting skilled workers immigrate would be good 	The state of the health service is one of the biggest problems we have, and the NHS one of our biggest assets (despite the problems with its running). It's being dismantled and I think regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, most of the public would fight to save it.
__label__Attack	This would be a lazy attempt to reduce hate speech as it doesn't allow for people to make genuine, thoughtful expressions of opinion that is useful for others to read.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	also would allow anyone to say whatever hate they havem to say	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__Support	Would provide personalized, relevant information to citizens	Economic inequalities are a major threat to liberal democracy
__label__Support	collapsing the comment section is not the solution because people have freedom of speech however those who make hateful comments can be flagged or banned from using the site	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I definitely agree	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I agree freedom of speech is important but hate speech should not be allowed	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Banning comment section is not a solution at all, the ban of comment sections is also the ban of freedom of speech/ opinions over all. The idea behind comment sections is for readers to share their different thoughts regarding the News with each other which is very important.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Where is this magic money tree, please tell me, I would love to know.  Doctors do private work which they get paid for. If everyone strikes then it has a knock on effect on everything else. 	If in doubt, remember that you are not voting for a party, or for a Prime Minister - you are voting for one MP to represent you, so vote for the one you think will do the best job and who shares most of your views.
__label__Support	A certain language criteria would be a better solution , restricting the limitations to ways of expression only 	haters may be removed is the system is able to identify them...so I think comment space can be kept but regulated 
__label__Attack	Immigration is not the cause of problems in this country, just blamed by politicians and the media 	I'm 50/50 on this. Nothing is wrong with immigration if people are skilled and are willing to be skilled. If there is a lack of people wanting to up-skill, why not allow the immigrants to take the jobs!

__label__Attack	I think this solution can be very intrusive. Especially in a times where our personal data is being collected as a commodity.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Slows down discussion.	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names.

__label__Attack	Commenting on online platforms with hate speech is a lazy, cowardly way of spreading negativity. If those who partake in this sort of online behaviour lacked the platform to do this, I don't think they would act out in other ways. I think they spread hate online as it's a very easy way to do so and takes no energy and is anonymous.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__Support	Although people might abuse the flagging, however, if there are reviewers to do their work on those flags, these comments that have been flagged intentionally would not be removed.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	While I mostly agree, I question whether a newspaper's goal is engage in discussion. It would likely depend on the paper. Some print media is certainly for discussion.

__label__Support	Really like that idea	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.

And it has to be addressed, even if it's expensive, even if it's monumental, even if it seems impossible to solve--because without working toward a solution, our planet and ourselves will cease to exist.
__label__Attack	A rights-based argument in this case would also need to consider that protection from discrimination is also a fundamental human right.

When you read it, a majority is about socialist policies and overreach of the government and is not relevant in anyway to climate change.  Other agreements let large polluters like China and India off the hook while expecting a disproportionate amount from the US.   This makes me very cynical about the overall agenda behind it.

It also gives right of way for those who think with pure ignorance to voice a factually incorrect and exaggerated opinion. These are not the types of opinions that should be openly shared or taught on the internet and in any given situation that it could happen they need to restrict it. To reduce free speech may be an infringement but allow hateful speech is just wrong."	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	I tend to agree with this. In this way editors have a close look to what opinion can be published and which one entails hate speech.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Attack	The downside to this is who is going to moderate it - where is the baseline of what is acceptable and what is not.  It's a real challenge.	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__Support	100% agreed, has this would work has everyone needs to learn how to respect others	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__Support	Very much agree, leadership however is looking very poor no matter what we choose. Defence is something needs money spent right away, specifically if the Orange buffoon gets back in	Agree with rejoining EU but can't see how this will happen in next 5 years 
__label__Support	Agreed, this article shares the same views. Its should not be the Newspaper taking accountability	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I don't agree as I don't think it's that easy to mix up hate speech and an opinion, if you genuinley don't have any hateful intentions. For example, not liking an establishments choices is much different from major hate/offensive speech	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__Attack	If we need other peoples opinions before we can form our own then we are literally just looking for confirmation bias of what we already believe	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Free speech should be allow or we would be like communist countries	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__Support	Agree, price of food items is so much higher than a few years ago	My lack of trust in the integrity and competence of the Political parties. Particulary around the economy and social care
__label__Support	Easy to do	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Yep. Rather implement ways in which one can refrain from hate speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	Agree in every sense, ticket prices, reliability etc. 	I can see why you don't want to, but I think if you didn't vote and then were unhappy with the outcome you might be kicking yourself a bit that you didn't at least try. 
__label__Attack	agree brexit is a disaster, but thats democracy? cant change it because we didnt like it. we voted for it (i didnt, but the collective we, did) 	Yes, I agree and they seem to think that we all want tax reductions when I would ather the money was spent on helping the NHS, etc get back on its feet.
__label__Attack	Additional administrative workload and time factor for posting comments	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__Attack	It's a nice idea but requires a lot of investment to write the counterarguments. How do we ensure that time is worthwhile and the responses will even be effective?	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__Attack	that will still allow people to write hate speech, coz they can.	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__Attack	Yes cost of living is high but it has happened before and will happen again. Bailing people out is costly as well.	voting tactically  is popular
__label__Attack	we need to adopt to the current situation , we should not deny that we are responsible for all the problem that we create in accordance with situation	We cannot adopt but we should adopt to it because there is no other go with the affected environment unless helping the environment  less pollution
__label__Attack	"Calling on the denegration on other people is not ""Having an opinion"" your view is your own, and you can have it, however when that overlaps into criticising other people for no other reason than they are differrent is not a ""view"", it is bigotry.  So there needs to be some form of moderation."	you cannot eliminate it.  dont try.  freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__Attack	different people will have different interpretations of 'disrespectful'	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	It is often very flawed and can flag up false positives	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__Support	Sharing how we all have learning from failure is very refreshing	Technological developments will enhance democracy and address current issues. 
__label__Attack	but the newspaper cannot be liable for how people respond,considering that most website are visited by adults with responsibilities.	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?
__label__Attack	is achievable	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__Support	L'avantage réside dans la baisse de pollution des grands centres urbains. Mais le réchauffement global ne baissera pas comme cela	Countries need not to spend much for this. It must initiate some compulsory programs and stop producing vehicles that depends on petrol etc
__label__Attack	this will encourage strives among the community	I dont think it is a fair choice.  For how long should people be silenced.  Hate speech is always going to be around.  Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__Attack	I believe that too much damage has already been done by governments around the world especially due to geoengineering tactics that have already caused harm that cannot be reversed.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	Couldn't agree more 	Inequality yes- but regarding what exactly?
__label__Attack	Why are you not prepared to think there is an alternative. Why do we have to put up with the illusion of choice. When a system is broken why would we look for a solution to that problem from within that same system? We need to think bigger. 	Hard to disagree with anything that you've said.  All crucial and will affect almost everybody.
__label__Support	yes which is worrying 	Tax policies aim to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share.
__label__Support	but doesn't the detection ai get better at filtering the more it works?	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are! 
__label__Attack	you should get a postal vote if you are not around on the day. it is a shame to waste your vote	The NHS needs sorting out
__label__Attack	This is unlikely to be feasible.  United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.
__label__Support	But also... an open comment section provides these individuals with a platform and instead of the desired open communication to educate people, it can be that more people become radicalised.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I think this is definitely important and will help but we need so much more than this. To me this is just one of the many important steps and changes we must make. All of these things and all of us working together can make a significant change.	I have heard that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference Closes with Limited Ambition
__label__Attack	does take a lot of work/ man power or bots which could over filter comment sections	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	Privacy issues. I know that my information are already somehow online but no one would be willing to give them freely, with the risk of being persecuted.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Attack	"But hate speech hurts. We can't let it just run rife because  it's ""too hard"" to address."	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	if one matter is not given enough attention than that would have bad consequences as if might not reach a lot of people	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__Attack	If you eliminate comments completely you both take away the right to free speech and inhibit the ability to have an open discussion about what constitutes hateful and offensive comments	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__Support	I agree that the hate speech perhaps should not be entirely removed. Sometimes a society has to confront its own ugliness/hatred head on, and removing it might do more harm than good (ie making commenters feel persecuted, perhaps making them even more hateful or violent). I also agree that still being able to access the newspaper might help change their minds.	"Hate speech should be flagged, hidden and the user should be given a strike. People should be able to still view those comments with a ""trigger warning"" disclaimer. After 3 strikes the user should be banned from commenting. But they should still be able to view the newspaper so that they don't miss an article that probably would have helped that particular person to change their behavior . More safe and reliable ways of verifying accounts should also be implemented."
__label__Support	We will discuss solutions too	Neither of the main parties have given us reason to trust them, and even if smaller parties can be more scrupulous there's no point voting for them in a GE. It's all very frustrating. 
__label__Attack	Generic and slightly focused on positional 'senior' leaders rather than the leadership role everyone can step into.	I know there are mechanisms already in place but I feel that most people do not even know they exist. They are not regularly used by institutions and I am not sure that those are intefral part of the usual policy making, particularly at local decisions, when the impact of actions is even more evident to people
__label__Attack	https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/15/20806384/social-media-hate-speech-bias-black-african-american-facebook-twitter	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with this comment	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!
__label__Support	There is a website that tells you who is more likely to win your area if you want to vote tactically. Whoever gets in (assuming it's not the Tories) is going to have a monster job sorting out the chaos that is currently in place 	Ending faith schools, all of them. Schools are to teach facts, homes and religious places can do the other stuff.
__label__Support	Exactly as they did the last time they got into power - they will ruin the Country again 	Whilst I agree that maybe immigration is an all time high however what I dont agree is Rwanda deportations, there should be a better system in place (ie skill shortage which we currently have) or give people opportunities - what I dont agree is the abuse of a system. Im an immigrant myself (16 years moved here) and opportunities are betetr especially in a career im at (stem) and theres a massive shortage of it and if people want a better life this shouldnt be held against them  
__label__Support	some of them have made a fortune fron it	EU decision-making processes are complex and difficult for citizens to understand
__label__Support	I also agree, while the Tories have been awful with regard to LGBTQ rights, I don't think Starmer has been strong enough in rebutting them.	make the ministerial code stronger with harsh penalties for breaking it
__label__Attack	I worry above the Conservative mind, its a selfish mind	who can handle the economy, balance the books and deal with businesses and governments abroasd
__label__Support	I agree, and this can be further enocouraged if the writerr or journalist engages with the comments that are being made on their story	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	History and recent events have shown that there should be limits to free speech	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	people get lazy because you get benefits to sit on your arse, cut benefits to bare minumim and increase tax free allowance. people would soon find a job	I have changed my vote for the first time in my life - voted by post. I am totally disenchanted by the depressing standard of human being that is offered by the two main parties.  They never answer questions and swerve with their repetitive rhetoric. They take the public for fools and wind their sentences away from every question. How can ANYONE believe in those kinds of people.  They are out for themselves ONLY.
__label__Attack	What works for Islington may not work across the country. Conservation policy work has always been constrained by lack of resources. It must be 30 years since we were trying to get govt to require Local Authorities to carry out Conservation Area Appraisals and keep them up to date. (John Preston)	yes people will become dumber because they will train their brains power less 
__label__Attack	a team of moderators won't be a viable option because, because people can't posts comments in real time	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	can be subjective what someone views as hate speech someone else might not agree	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr!  However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior.  Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!
__label__Attack	I've found this is quite a common position 	living crises and NHS waiting  list
__label__Support	That's true. Most social media companies are already using AI to detect and remove hate speech. Here's an article about this: https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__Attack	People should be allowed to express their opinions as long as they are done so respectfully	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I agree, there's so many people that cannot afford to properly live anymore	NHS Backlog, LGBTQ rights, housing crisis, cost of living
__label__Support	This is interesting! I read an article about moderators with different policies on what constitutes hate speech and should be removed. There is an argument that some are too strict and moderate incivility, rather than just hate speech. Perhaps an AI version would have clearer guidelines programmed in? https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__Support	Conservative approach - manufacture problems, then profit from selling the solutions. 	Hardly the most important issue just now
__label__Support	True picture of peoples lives will be shared and discussed	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__Support	Agreed, I have two young children and this worries me - as well as online content/social media and the lack of impetus the government has put of challenging large social media corporations 	More support for small businesses, start ups etc. From what I've seen it really isn't that good in terms of practical help, advice and support, seems to be run by councils ticking boxes and under qualified advisers speaking about the obvious 
__label__Support	100% - they are one and the same. 	Essentially agree on all of these plus add the NHS and social care
__label__Attack	There is some evidence that AI systems can be pretty effective at detecting hate speech! For example: https://ai.facebook.com/blog/how-ai-is-getting-better-at-detecting-hate-speech/	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__Attack	When people are given choice to comment, trolls will come out naturally and therefore so will hate speech. You can only educate those willing to be educated.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Hate comments can manifest into something much worse and is absolutely neccesary to destroy the source of the hate.	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__Attack	less ideas generated	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Healthcare is really important to me. I think the government have been using immigration to blame their poor governance, it gives them someone to blame.  	Investment in infrastructure
__label__Support	Would support accountability instead of a comment submitter operating in the mystery and shroud of being anonymous.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	I think squeezing the short-term NHS funding has meant more long-term health issues for a lot of people	I would like zero hour contracts abolished. Sadly, it will not happen.
__label__Support	Agree that climate change is a massive challenge and no parties are doing enough to combat it] 	investmen tin people
__label__Attack	I understand your point but I think you're misinterpreting the point of this. Hate speech is damaging and should not be condoned in any form, regardless of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech includes allowing people to talk about their opinions, but not threatening people or expressing prejudice against certain groups.	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__Support	would move the issue somewhere else	There should be no comment area in order to limit hate speech. Newspapers should be one-sided sources of information.
__label__Attack	what do you propose we do about that?	investmen tin people
__label__Attack	There is a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech. One is neccesary, intellectual and somewhat constructive without being rude. The other is a global problem causing suicide attempts and mental health issues.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	this is just a response with no constructive information. We cannot just say this, throw up our hands and walk away	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	most topics have at least 2 opinions	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?
__label__Support	I like this idea, I hope everyone is able to be respectful to each other but unfortunately this is not always the case	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	limitations are important.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	why? I am on a zero hour contract and I love it, I only work when I want to 	That's an excellent point in fairness. If they think they can get away with anything, you end up with characters like Donald Trump running the place.
__label__Attack	Simultaneously limits freedom of opinion. A censored comment section can hinder thought-provoking discussions	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Attack	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem but cause further frustration. It also takes away the opportunity for people to engage about issues and share ideas.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	This is very true, but then isn't it time to start before it gets to be a worse situation? The economic impacts are starting to hit now.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	Hate speech on newspaper websites reflects bad on the publication. Therefore, removing hate speech is quite essential.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	None of the above solves nothing. At the end of the day someones going to be elected, abstaining means you should be fine with whoever gets elected. To me it's choosing the lesser of the evils	Immigration is crucial to everything - can't run a country properly with all the services we need with crazy numbers 
__label__Support	I totally agree with this statement.	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__Attack	they do have clear strategies, all the conservatives care about is that people dont vote labour	we need tax revenue topay for servises we can1t expect good infrastructure and effective public services for free
__label__Support	Users who want to comment will find other ways of doing so such as via facebook or other social media channels. Free speech needs to be permitted otherwise a balance is not provided.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I agree with this point of view - a lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	removing the comment section is a solution for avoiding hate speech, it's just whether people agree with it being removed.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	Yup! its always the case 	Rent caps will deter private landlords entering the market ultimately making the situation worse as there will be less rental properties on the market 
__label__Support	Not more funding, but better use of the money they have.	Do we all agree that the cost of living is the biggest issue right now?
__label__Support	there is no hate speech	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I am generally in favor of giving an opportunity to the opposition in such a situation. This way, at least we ensure that leaders are held accountable and do not feel invincible.	Improve civic education, especially for young people dkjdfjsdfkslkdf
__label__Support	The establishment elites will never stop the truth, they don't want to be criticised in any way. If truth is banned in online media, people will find another way of discussing truth, like samizdat in Soviet Union	"Younger people are susceptible to propaganda by the establishment ""elites"", they will be easy targets of manipulation by saying that ALL opposing views are ""hate speech""."
__label__Attack	We're already experiencing an economic crisis. We can't just keep investing in preventing climate change. We have other priorities.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	However it could be argued that t it is so difficult for moderators to see the difference between someone practicing their freedom of speech and the idea of hate speech against a protected characteristic.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	User flagging would be perfect and yes modaretors but they won't be available all the time	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__Attack	And who would be removing these comments and how do we know that they do not have other motivates behind trying to remove the comment.	By simply monitoring the comments and blocking the negative ones and removing them
__label__Support	Scientists have been saying this many years now, it seems people just want to ignore the problems and hope it will go away on its own! 	The planet has its long, long history and doesn't need man at all. How are we sure that climate change is damaging to the planet and not just man?
__label__Attack	I think that people need to be able to post comments but not offend others so I think that it should be policed by the webiste or they need to consider AI to filter out bad comments	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I am also changing who I vote for, and not bothering to vote tactically either as the most likely candidate to win has also produced weasel words on the big issues that are going to affect the local area.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	And what good will that exactly do?	Probably not. Most elections are really a case of trying to pick the best of a bad bunch. 
__label__Support	Not all opinions can be respected, especially those that violate other people's rights and identities.	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__Attack	I think appointing moderators for this task is quite costly and it will be based on the subjective opinion of the moderator. Interference will prevent freedom of speech and will be a bit biased.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Support	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	I don't think these are all realistic goals. 	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Support	Moderating will reduce hate speech and allow open discussion without personal, insulting opinions	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	This could be costly depending on how many articles there are to review	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	There has to be fairness somewhere	safe spaces for women 
__label__Support	How will a newspaper manage to do this?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I disagree as some comments are constructive and may help other users. Otherwise you just get an echo chamber.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Yes, and to do that those of us who are reasonably well off need to recognise that we need to make sacrifices. Just like a set of scales, to level up some areas others may have to level down. 	Lack of integrity 
__label__Support	Sorry this one was too	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	But are moderators available to this? And who agrees what can be said and what can't be?	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__Attack	difficult to judge hate speech	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.

__label__Attack	Definitely not Labour, their councils have destroyed my area and the surrounding area. I don't want the country to go the same way. 	Essentially agree on all of these plus add the NHS and social care
__label__Attack	(sorry I mean one in ten)	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common.

__label__Attack	The media is based on the idea that they have the freedom to write or speak about any topic they wish. To take that same idea away from other people to respond and contribute freely to what is being said would be the end of a diverse and opinionated society. I don't think that silencing the reader would stop them in engaging and maybe even caring.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section.

__label__Attack	You can reduce hate speech in the comment section by flagging certain vocabulary which directly relates to hate speech, which then will automatically block the comment and therefore cannot be posted.

__label__Attack	It is their responsibility though because if someone feels unsafe on their platform due to hate commentary then they lose customers and in some eyes may endorse hate speech by not doing anything to address it or try and filter it.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	i think you are in the minority here haha, most of the world are moving to the right, look at France, its almost going hard right. in the UK, we've had a right wing gov for 14yrs who havent exactly succeeded - ive not seen any left wing extremism anywhere! 	The amount of illegal immigration there is in the country. The cost of living crisis, food and energy prices
__label__Support	NHS funding is not keeping up with an ageing and growing population.	I think there has been a major breakdown in trust over the last few years
__label__Support	I agree that we, as humans, can adapt to the situation as best as possible. But we can also take small steps towards change. The situation doesn't have to be impossible. 	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	Being able to keep comments open is not a justification or a refutation of the presence of hate speech.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__Support	I also agree with both of your points. Its been making who to vote for really difficult for me. As i don't trust any of the parties will fulfil what we need.	There's a labour shortage right now and the adult social care system is heavily reliant on migrant labour. Migrants are also less likely to use the NHS and other public services than non-migrants 
__label__Attack	Those people can get away with the comment only if they are anonymous. Such nasty comments can block your connection in near future	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I agree. The NHS needs a major overhaul I think. Funding should go to people on the frontline, not just  the higher ups.	that is the problem we face majorly health care and education need to be rectify
__label__Support	I cannot remember a more openly corrupt govt. From PPE scandal, to betting to partygate....just when you think they can't get lower they sink again.

__label__Attack	Comments should add to the article though and the commenters often go down a facebook-style rant about something not helpful or relevant, I don't think this is the right space for this	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	"@LawrenceM and @AndrewA said it best. This world is already in utter chaos. Humanity? Is that even a thing anymore. Lets's not add further to a world which is breeding hate, discrimination, selfish propoganda, etc on a daily basis.

__label__Support	It could reduce the presence of hate.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	This reduces free speech and lets the negative win	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	We cannot rely to other people to recognize hate	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship.  I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it.  Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.  Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy.  They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__Support	I would say the same	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I don't want responsibility 	"I really like the idea of working groups. This fosters more informal and free discussion, and makes the exercise more interactive. We could be ""itinerant"" facilitators. "
__label__Attack	seems to me to describe management as much as leadership and too generic and not HE specific.......	I know there are mechanisms already in place but I feel that most people do not even know they exist. They are not regularly used by institutions and I am not sure that those are intefral part of the usual policy making, particularly at local decisions, when the impact of actions is even more evident to people
__label__Support	Could be effective to some extent as it could prevent hate speech being available on these websites	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__Attack	Totally get why Britain is on board to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels but the infrastructure is not there to support it. I do not think the country should bankrupt itself to try to achieve net-zero, when the majority of people can't afford EVs, or heat pumps. So only rich folk will be able to drive cars?  Can our roads cope with more EVs, which are much much heavier than normal cars? Also at the end of the day, until the likes of China and India buy into climate change and rein in their own industries, tiny little old Britain isn't really making a difference but will be making a lot of people miserable	Pledge to support NHS, pledge to support workers and workers rights, pledge not to raise taxes
__label__Support	i kind of agree... If you tell someone the news and they respond with hate speech, it's not your fault or your responsibility to silence them	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	I think moderation is key, so do agree!	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net. This would make more work for the newspapers but would only require one person to constantly monitor what is being submitted and only allow reasonable comments.
__label__Attack	This may end up filtering out individuals with valid opinions that just feel safer commenting anonymously.	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__Support	Yes it does - but without the label 'racist' when talked about	i think they go together as we have an ageing population we do need some immigration
__label__Attack	I don't think we should rely on AI or algorithms to safeguard comment sections. Algorithms are only as reliable as the coding, and that is done in total darkness.	"In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to ""teach"" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all."
__label__Attack	But then no-one can give useful positive advice	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I agree. Articles are written purely so that they can absorb hate comments to boost th e post.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I totaly agree, it will help to screen the comments in a way to avoid such incidences where people say things that can be hateful to another person. With the help of the technology i do belive this can be achieved in future to avoid being violated.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Support	I agree with the idea that anonymity on the Internet often has the consequence to make it easier for people to harass / be horrible to each others.

__label__Attack	Ai could be used to flag, but then an experienced arbitrator is needed to decide if item removed	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.

__label__Support	Agreed. The same is happening on a global level... France, Trump...	Yes they are just in it for what they can get out of it
__label__Attack	Some dissenting opinions and hate comments can spur conversation and be used as a learning opportunity, but it is important for people who use hate speech to be removed from the platform if it becomes too much.

__label__Support	Agreed - investment is a key word here. reducing homelessness reduces other pin ch points in places like healthcare etc.	Well said and well put argument here
__label__Attack	I do agree with education and raising awareness but what about bots and people who simply want to cause trouble?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	removing comments section is never going to encourage tolerance it is	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech.

__label__Support	Having a moderator and strict rules in place to ban or suspend accounts that express a form of hate speech is needed. Actually replying to that comment as the newspaper will show everyone else that it really is not okay	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.

__label__Attack	No certificates should be needed to detect a hate comments, it comes to ethics and morality 	I agree with this, and I think it is made more difficult by fast-moving technology and information on what's most effective.  What is the best source(s) of information for each of the groups needing to know more? Can we build a list? 
__label__Support	I agree 	The easy way for a bot or system to analyze what could be a hate speech could be to select certain words that are usually associated to descrimination. This could be developed by studying existing comments and seeing what are the most repeated dialogues. 
__label__Attack	It is an easy programming process to do so.	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Support	I agree.  People should not stay silent through fear of someone taking offence at what they say.  How can people figure out what their viewpoints are on things if they aren't allowed to ask questions are think aloud?	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__Support	This would be an effective measure in preventing hate speech from being published.	Comment spaces should be moderated, perhaps even approved before posting.
__label__Attack	I'm not sure the answers to those questions but if more of us put pressure on policy makers to invest funds into scientific studies it would give us a greater idea, but no one seems to care or want to spend any money to improve understanding of the issue.

Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	hate speech online only leads to hate speech in real life. online is where much of the real world violence is incited and begins.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Yes, I would be much more likely to post, read and respond to comments on a website location that is moderated and checked before posting	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__Attack	what specifically about immigration	Rebulding the NHS, better education, taxation, honesty and integrity of elected representitives
__label__Attack	I think hate speech should be reduced as much as possible if not removed completely. This is very different from being able to provide constructive criticism which should always be allowed but there are boundaries.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	will encourage dialogue	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__Support	This is a good solution which would reduce burden on moderators, whilst also automating some of the process.	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech.

__label__Support	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social  media problem as well, more like an internet problem.

__label__Attack	I disagree. In an Institute for Government webinar yesterday (24/10 https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/events/what-works-government-evidence-policy) the point was made that the public are not educated to challenge what they read in the media. It is therefore naive to assume that people would start to search around things they read in the news because 1) we are not taught how to do this and 2) there is no motive for people to begin to do this. Based on the amount of conspiracy documentaries on Netflix and YouTube it is possible that people would indeed search around what they read but for negative/conspiracy motives rather than as ground truthing.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	It's important to allow people to provide their own commentary	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__Attack	I appreciate that everyone has the right to freedom of speech but at the expense of others and being hateful?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Support	Should reduce hate speech and other inappropriate comments	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it.  Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.

__label__Support	I agree, Article 19 of the ICCPR guarantees the right to freedom of expression but also disallows discrimination. Restricting any sort of speech violates the right to freedom of expression and can be utilised by leadership or publications to discriminate. https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__Support	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	Because hate speech causes so many unwanted consequences, this kind of liberal approach doesn't seem fruitful. Although education and counter-speech are important (https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence), we have to protect free speech while eliminating comments that incite violence.	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is  from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__Attack	i agree there has to be a balance, and freedom of speech is important for society.. but there has to be limits as to hate speech, and discrimination.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	I should tell you why i agree, right?	no
__label__Attack	The biggest problem that there is	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place. A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__Support	I think we can fight climate change I don't think it is too late yet.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	Agree. it also highlights the need for work to be done on hate speech/racism. Just because the comments section isn't there, doesn't mean hate speech  doesn't exist.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	"The thing is if people filter these comments, they may not work as accurate as AI. For example, they may use their own judgements to decide if something is appropriate. If we use AI, we can simply add new filters, like words or phrases, AI will filter all comments in the way we ""teach"" it."	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__Attack	this is a great way to monitor	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__Support	I tend to agree with this as the problem of entrenched ideas is increased with the echo chamber approach to collecting infrmation	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__Attack	Only allowing paying users might result in the most of the users in a comment section having the same view. For example, many young people do not use newspaper websites. Each comment section might not be diverse at all in type of users or the opinions being shared. Is an echo chamber better, equal to, or worse than a few hate comments?	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__Support	I'm also not on a large income but agree. I'd rather sacrifice a few percent of my wage for better services for all 	The incoming government should make relevant and long term rules regarding immigration 
__label__Attack	but people who do not have you interests at heart will... not a wise move. Any selection is better than none surely>	They can't be handled any worse than how they are currently handled though.
__label__Attack	I do agree that sometimes people can mistake different opinions as hate speech but I do think it is quite easy to understand that hate speech involves language that disrespect the person you are talking to	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__Support	I agree with this comment sections can provide excellent reccomendations, for example: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/20/steely-dans-20-greatest-songs-ranked	I think that keeping a comment section is overall good as it keeps engagement but needs to be heavily moderated and regulated so it doesn't just dissolve into a lot of hate speech and grounds for radicalisation
__label__Support	We need to get out of the ECHR	I agree with all of this 
__label__Support	One of the problems with social media is the use of bots which dramatically wreak havoc with algorithms. It creates a technical imbalance and an environment that is less reality based and more echo chamber. Cleaning this up would be a huge start.	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__Attack	There are some local politicians who are definitely trustworthy, not so sure about the ones playing up to the TV cameras though!	I can understand when you know that little will change under our present voting system
__label__Attack	I agree,the should be someone who's hired to check comment and to block.Also those who bully people shoul not be allowed on the site	I think newspapers websites should have an online system  that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.

The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I think this is a good solution for the problem. People will always find a way around it but it will eliminate at least some hateful comments.	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__Support	I agree that anybody being allowed to comment can give rise to fake news in comment sections	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Possible infringment on data	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__Support	the same as my idea	block the person who always use hate speech
__label__Support	I totattluy disagree because.....	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	I believe there are no pros to allowing hate speech	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	It may be a high-cost approach, but worthwhile for our modern society to prioritise for the good of a healthy, functioning nation.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	Brexit created the belief that problems go away if you spout B/S. Boris has a lot to answer for. 	Agreed - in some situations, people choose not to work as they would be financially worse off. That needs changing.
__label__Support	also, less caddle means less incentives for deforestation 	I believe thats an accurate solution 
__label__Attack	I disagree because it is still tolerating that intolerant people express themselves and make their opinions visible. Even if they are removed,it will take a while for that to happen and this hateful message may have already found an echo in another bigot.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	good idea, my worry is that using human paid moderators wilol push up the cost of newspaper subscriptions	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It will not give people the ability to have freedom of speech	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__Support	Comment sections seem rather pointless anyway and are just usually vessels for people to argue. There's social media nowadays to weigh in on your opinion	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Simpler communication could increase citizen engagement	Stronger action could damage EU-Israel relations
__label__Attack	Despite this there is woefully little work done to date on behaviour change and mobilisation within diverse groups, specifically in relation to ethnicity and disability	The first and simple advice often given by one of my colleagues is “thicker curtains across window and doors” . It’s short term and achievable for residents while other interventions are in planning (John Preston) 
__label__Support	I totally agree we have freedom of expression	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	While I agree that hate speech is such, I feel like getting rid of the comment section would really go backwards and do more harm than good.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I think that every platform (websites, socials, etc.) have the responsability to filter and regulate what's happening on their platform.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	if comments spaces are removed it also lessens freedom of speech	I definitely think newspapers should remove the comment space because it encourages trolls and hate speech
__label__Attack	Some people may set up fake details / profiles in order to still post the hateful comments.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I agree. What does it help to not even try to change the advancement of climate change?	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	I agree while hate speech can be and should be monitored and removed immediately in order to reduce trauma on affected group and not to embolden other bigots. Platforms should still allow users to express opinions contrary to the creators. Peer review of reporting works well in these instances when someone goes too far - but this is also abused by with review bombing	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	That's a good speech! Unfortunately, in the real world, that doesn't work. For the most part, people that comments on newspapers websites are adults (or late teens) and already got an education. And yes, for the most part, it'll be enough, they have good values and know how to share ideas without hate. But for some, it's not the case...	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.

It is not just about voting, democracy is not just about voting and we should find ways to communicate this to people and policymakers	There may be challenges in balancing openness with security and privacy concerns
__label__Attack	AI algorithms are frequently biased. There's still a long way to go before reliable AI algorithms are developed. Until then, using AI algorithms alone to moderate the comment sections of newspapers will likely lead to harmless comments removed, and, on the other hand, harmful comments published. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/04/the-role-of-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/?sh=3bf5308b579d	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts! 	"Climate change is anyways is a hoax! 31,000 scientists reject global warming and say ""no convincing evidence"" that humans can or will cause global warming"
__label__Attack	Who guards the guardians?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I agree 100%. It's too easy to shut down all speech, just because someone gets offended by things that they do not agree with. This will only then attract the bullies and trolls who want to shout down anyone who isn't in lock step with their own narrow viewpoint.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	have profiles that are always flagged totally blocked	by just making the section smaller and have trasparency with dooing so
__label__Attack	I don't think most people would take the time to educate each other about hate speech, and I assume there will be stubborn people that are stuck in their ways and will continue to comment their hateful opinions.	Like I mentioned previously,the need for artificial intelligence is vital and like what AliceW mentioned in hjer post that people needs to be educated about hate speech which I strongly support.I also think it is everyone's responsibility to educate each other the damage hate speech has to individuals and the society at large
__label__Attack	most immigrants are doctors, lawyers, tax accountants.... the majority of people dependent on welfare are UK citizens who did not pay attention in school. 	In some ways I disagree, as renters have a right to earn money during the increased housing costs, but also I do agree that kicking people out when they decide to up the prices is horrific. It should be that an agreed price is arranged and the government do something to make sure that the need for increased rent is limited. 
__label__Attack	The right to free speech doesn't mean there are no consequences for hate speech. Tolerating hate speech is not going to make it go away.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Agree  - More pay for people who help others. Less for those who help themselves.	the NHS is something that should be funded properly and not taken into the hands of privateers, which I fear is getting very close, it will become a two tier system that means only those that can afford it will get the treatment needed.  Very scary what is likelyto happen 
__label__Support	This really need to be addressed, however i thin there are too many big lobbyists. IF we have oil and gas we should do what norway does and have a sovereign fund.  Then you see idiots like the one to the left 'i love my diesel engine', you may well do, but people love there kids and their countries, more important	investmen tin people
__label__Support	if No more trolls, political copy-pastes, or general rudeness and anger are in comments i think both sides of arguement/opinion can be heard.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Algorithms dont always get it right	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__Support	I can understand when you know that little will change under our present voting system	Pensions, Immigraation, the NHS, 
__label__Support	I appreciate the balance here.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Celebrities are a massive victim of hate speech allowing people the freedom of commenting what they want is harmful. A lot of the time articles will use these comments in other articles to back up negative opinions about others	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	without online verified profiles being mandatory i think this could be difficult to put into practise	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__Attack	Absolutely agree,and public opinion seems to favour this approach.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!	100% agree, especially with the comment about immigrants being blamed
__label__Support	We should try and make the internet a more welcoming place.	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__Attack	Some readers will give their honest response that will assist the writers where to change or improve	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	An improvement on this would be to have a flagged comment be reviewed by a moderator rather than just delete a comment altogether.	I think newspapers websites should introduce a bot that would delete automatically all posts that have too many hate words in it.
__label__Attack	We alreay pay taxes.... and don't get the good infrastructure... so it's not about money. they can raise the taxes wherever they want the issue wont resolve, as they dont want to resolve it.	Bulk of immigration problem is from illegal routes which the government has never been bold enough to take the bull by the horns. 
__label__Support	Maybe just turn the comments off what are obviously polarising matters.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	I agree completely. People need to be educated	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Hate speech is a form of verbal assault and should not be tolerated or encouraged.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Support	Let's hope they win.	reform the media. MSM should not be owned by foreign nationals. Make disinformation in the media an offence
__label__Support	People are entitled to an opinion that isn't hateful or intended to harm a person.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	I agree that it is impossible for a human moderator to read every comment and react quick enough to an offensive comment before it has been read by other commentators.	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__Support	i agree that if people are going to use social media they need to expect hate	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__Support	Europe has more economic leverage over Israel than the US	It can help improve efficiency and sustainability of production
__label__Attack	that isn't bad, but there are some who can run circles around others with their linguistic skills	by having a system or word check that will not allow users to use words that are considered as hate speech
__label__Attack	People bypass these filters in a large number of ways that are hard to stay ahead of. A simple method for example is replacing an E with a 3 in a word so egg becomes 3gg. It is still pretty clear what is being said and bybasses the system that says I can not use that word for example.	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.

__label__Support	Agree with regulating it	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Much as I agree that's probably ideal as far as not requiring constant monitoring of the sort that's only really feasible for a relatively small amount of newer articles, the kind of technology for properly filtering such things isn't quite there yet, beyond simply checking for specific language. ...and it's worth noting, even if it was, whoever writes the algorithm also decides what is worthy of being removed. Being able to cull commentary automatically this way is potentially even more damaging if your concern is freedom of speech.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that there is no need for comment sections under newspaper articles when most of the comments end up being a form of hate speech. A separate platform to discuss these articles would be better as it could be more easily monitored.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	You have to constantly ban people when they create new accounts	The root cause of most issues is likely from a select few, root out the troublemakers and ban accordingly.
__label__Support	Agreed! Probably can never get rid of it completely but taking steps to reducing it is 100% needed!	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Right, because the Tories can be trusted with your money... 	I think all the parties need new leaders.
__label__Attack	Most, if not all, politicians are in this for themselves. It's a career choice.	"perhaps we need PR and making it legal to vote , this means having ""none of the above"" option.      It works in other countries.  I have met opel who do not bother to vote   "

__label__Support	People buy papers knowing the paper's political stance. I read articles to understand a journalist's perspective.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	we need to protect our environment or life is going to be tougher in the future	We really need to do much more here. But I feel things like solar farms are not the way, the batteries leak into water supplies etc, we need to look at new green ways 
__label__Attack	I disagree. Would you like to read a newspaper filled with hate speech just because they are not in charge of identifying what is hate speech or not?	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	I agree completely. I argue that it is not up to the newspaper websites to police such discussion and that comments only harm the neutral perspective that they offer. There are plenty of other discussion platforms  #like Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter, where such discussions could take place and where other users have the power to moderate the community opinion themselves.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	If in doubt, remember that you are not voting for a party, or for a Prime Minister - you are voting for one MP to represent you, so vote for the one you think will do the best job and who shares most of your views.	Because zero hour contracts aren't good for people who want to work full time hours. A mortgage advisor is hardly going to think you are an ideal buyer.

There is no really way to gain respect back after everything.  
__label__Attack	It is the best solution	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.

__label__Support	Offers good ways to combat hate speech on newspaper websites.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I agree, there are currently no online hate speech statistics available due to a lack of means to report hate speech: https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/	A reporting site that is accessible across all platforms would be a good start like https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime.
__label__Support	I think when there are professionals they can be balanced and have training alongside guidelines which can help guide what is and is not allowed	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	my thoughts exactly..Hate speech can also be helpful in improving the news papers.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	there  would be no hate speech	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	However, some people may unfortunately not want to be educated and may still believe this stuff, but in that case no amount of removing comments, hate speech or education would help them, so they're already a lost cause.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	would be a very good start to flagging hateful people	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.

__label__Attack	Any expression that freely and openly gives a clear point that will not offend or insult anyone is not hate speech	Provide guidance on what is and isnt hate speech would work i think
__label__Attack	Using algorithms is a valid option for many things, but analyzing text is still quite difficult for computers. They're are not very good at detecting sarcasm or irony, for instance.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__Support	Yes, reduce waiting lists, get people help they need and in turn seen improvements in policing, homlessness, unemployement etc.  	Scottish Independence has had its day. How can Scotland support itself?
__label__Attack	I believe you are referencing an AI, but that would require certain technology and datasets for it to understand what to look for. You can also argue that hateful words can be used in a certain context to argue a point, rather than as a directly hateful comment.	The comments could be checked for hateful speech. For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.

__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others. 	Research and twenty one years experience suggests that there is little doubt that many people from different parts of civil society feel disconnected or excluded from environmental action and discussion at just the time when the environmental sector is working to develop and expand engagement.

I wish people were as you describe, but I have yet to see any evidence of it.	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with.

__label__Attack	i dont agree, it is too controlling , there needs to be a middle ground of moderating	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!

__label__Attack	Yes, but we will not have the money to address it while we spunk it all on illegal migrants and Net-Zero	voting tactically  is popular
__label__Attack	the cost of paying someone to monitor this	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__Attack	Not voting isn't an effective form of protest though. It's just taking the easy way out!	Close the tax loop holes and put more resource into tackling tax avoidance/evasion

__label__Attack	It can be difficult to automate this monitoring	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__Support	Removing the comments section won't make much difference as people just migrate to different platforms to continue posting hate speech, the EU setup a code of conduct for countering illegal hate speech, https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en, this has had an effect on hate speech online and is something that newspapers can be part of if they want to help stop hate speech being posted by users responding to online articles.

__label__Attack	The idea of using AI algorithms to combat hate speech is an attractive one. However, using experience of Facebook, it's clear that AI systems are still not advanced enough to undertake this task without human oversight. Facebook often censors posts or comments unfairly because its AI algorithms doesn't understand the context. In short, I don't believe we can get away without using humans to check the flagged comments at least.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I don't think it will make a difference. People will comment elsewhere. Fake news spreads more rapidly on social media than from the comments section of a newspaper website. I think the whole issue is being over thought.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	there is a distinction between comments that are made directly in a discriminative way and comments that create a dialogue. 	I think sometimes retrofit can work in sympathy with historic elements of architecture, and actually result in the highlighting of period features.  If I can dig it out, there was a good case-study of a church that had been fundraising for a new roof. In the end, due to the roof not being visible from the highway, or easily from ground-level, they were able to install solar PV panels to effectively cover the damaged roof with a secondary, waterproof layer - with clear benefits of electricity generation as well as original goal of fixing leaks... 
__label__Attack	This dos seem a little harsh,  a little negativity will push you to greatness. I am for moderation.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Human-based detection exists for certain content, but represents a really high cost for companies.	A key factor that could make filtering unfair is the fact that is done merely by automatic detection tools without human vetting or control. 
__label__Support	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	This would work well with non-bias moderators	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__Attack	i dont believe eliminating the space for readers comments is the right thing, readers should be allowed to comment and moderators can be used to reduce harmful/hateful speech	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Creates a platform for fake news	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	The problem with this is that the moderator themselves often have an agenda.	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website
__label__Attack	not difficult, would say need more work and maybe more money spent in discovering something new	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__Support	This is definitely a major concern. For the first time children are going to be worse off than their parents	i mean i get what youre saying, but realistically peppa pig could be in charge of the country and still would  have people arguing over whats not being done. no matter whos in charge or what party, theyre always going to do something wrong or bad i personally dont think it matters whos in charge 
__label__Attack	I don't think banning people from commenting would lead them to do something more powerful or extreme.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__Attack	I think that the human capital to employe human vetting would not be sufficient in a first filtering phase	A key factor that could make filtering unfair is the fact that is done merely by automatic detection tools without human vetting or control. 
__label__Support	Software is efficient	Develop a software that will not allow posting of any hate speech
__label__Attack	Moderators have biases as well which could result in a censorship of differing opinions that do not qualify as hate speech.	Comment spaces should be moderated, perhaps even approved before posting.

__label__Attack	The reason why I disagree is because removing the comment sections unable readers from expressing their view and opinions on certain topics covered in the newspaper.	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.

__label__Attack	This conversation helps us to think more regard this issue, we are learning more. Our conscience makes us alert and we will work for it. At least from our home.	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts. 
__label__Support	I agree and also that some comment may not have been posed to upset/hurt, but can do, so educating people in how to respond would be a good thing.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	Same here, but I have decided for change, and my postal vote has gone in!	Close the tax loop holes and put more resource into tackling tax avoidance/evasion
__label__Attack	Don't agree with tactical voting. It is a dishonest vote as you are not voting for who you really want.	I am sad to say that, following the information on the media, politicians seem to be less than 100% reliable.
__label__Support	I like this idea - there could also be a warning system for those reading the comments, if something does get published that possibly shouldn't have. A warning stating that the following comment may be offensive and contain hate speech.	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Research and twenty one years experience suggests that there is little doubt that many people from different parts of civil society feel disconnected or excluded from environmental action and discussion at just the time when the environmental sector is working to develop and expand engagement. There is is a need on both sides to be heard, listened to and understood.

__label__Attack	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.	Cost of upgrades, which are always higher for properties in a heritage setting, are unaffordable for individual owners in low wage, low property value areas. 
__label__Support	i agree, the cost of living is a big issue that needs to be addressed 	Agreed - The party is represented by their candidates, and so many of them have vile political or personal  histories.

__label__Support	There is no place for hate speech in today's society for hate speech. It is harmful and in some cases, illegal.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I would like to be able to see why this comment was removed.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	Yes, I totally agree with this. Actually, I think this might be the solution to this problem. If comments are moderated before they go public then there is no chance that offensive and inappropriate comments will make it to the public comments section.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	the NHS is something that should be funded properly and not taken into the hands of privateers, which I fear is getting very close, it will become a two tier system that means only those that can afford it will get the treatment needed.  Very scary what is likelyto happen 	But first and foremost you have to agree with what theyre promising
__label__Support	that is true the developers hate to filter, using mods and bots to detect the hate speech	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.

__label__Support	A total change which represents millions I voted Reform 	We really need to do much more here. But I feel things like solar farms are not the way, the batteries leak into water supplies etc, we need to look at new green ways 
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	In 2008 my tax bill was FOUR times larger as a proportion of my wage than it is today	I think all the parties need new leaders.
__label__Support	Hate speech cannot be tolerated.	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!

Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Great! I have a similar approach	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	these are very important issues that need seeing to urgently	making sure to vote to give conservatives a chance
__label__Support	It is truly dire, I think that's why we are here, to test it, not to talk about the election.	I am not sure if this will happen 
__label__Support	I agree, education is the best way in stopping this in the future https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/preventive-role-of-education	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Support	I agree! I think restricting comment sections won't stop harmful opinions, they will just be posted elsewhere. But creating a safer environment for these discussions would be good	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this. Privatisation has been a huge mistake 	They have run this country into the ground in my opinion, cut police and NHS funding, crime rates have gone up, illegal immigration at an all time high, cost of living crisis. Why do you think they would be better for us than labour this time round? 
__label__Attack	well that would affect the credibility of the newspaper and reputation so yes it is a big responsibility to maintain spaces civilised	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	The content is then controlled by the moderators. How do we ensure that a comment they simply disagree with but still adds to the discussion is let through?	Moderation of the comments section
__label__Attack	People may stop reading news sites if they don't feel able to interact with them as they have been able to previously. This could lead to people seeking their news info all the more from highly unregulated/skewed sources, such as social feeds.

__label__Support	Trying to convince those with extreme views often leads to unproductive arguments that reinforce divisions	We should focus communication efforts on the middle ground rather than trying to persuade extreme positions
__label__Support	Professionality	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.

__label__Attack	How will we stop/prevent people from being aggressive with their opinion though particularly if they find a news story disagreeable?	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	Sometimes people do need to be censored, especially when it comes to hate speech because sometimes those words become actions and people get assaulted in real life. Words spoken online sometimes rally people together to take action (for example what happened in the United States when people stormed the Capitol because of fake news spreading online about the voting results being fraudulent https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/election-misinformation-helped-fuel-jan-6-capitol-attack-now-climate-misinformation-threatens-planet/ )	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I think if the hateful users find other places to share their opinions, they might find similar minded people and create a hateful community that might do more harm than just the individuals	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__Attack	"The problem is some form of censorship would be required for writers if the definition of ""hate speech"" isn't universally agreed. Perhaps a trigger warning for readers of a sensitive disposition could be given at the start of an article. Different countries have different laws or understandings of hate speech. Will comments from different countries have to be blocked?"	Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__Support	True, we need to increase technology to deal with this problem.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology

"perhaps we need PR and making it legal to vote , this means having ""none of the above"" option.      It works in other countries.  I have met opel who do not bother to vote   "
__label__Support	This may work	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Support	By holding them liabile it will remove negativity on the platform.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	agree with this totally, and I think that was my opinion earlier	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__Attack	I think if saying something out loud in a public place would get you arrested, you should not be allowed to type it online.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	This are very important issues to me too 	potholes and big Oil & gas corporations being taxed huge profits to tackle their green house gases 
__label__Attack	In addition to using algorithms, technology can be used to eliminate comments that involve hate speech for reader inclusivity. I definitely agree to this. Everyone has a freedom of speech, but it should infringe the rights of others too.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Support	Discussions helps to deepen learning, to remove it completely would hinder what you could know but they need to be monitored for sure. Hate speech is not okay.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree it is an individual's responsiblity to choose their words carefully, and if they don't then their comments, or eventually if they persist, their accounts should be removed.	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__Attack	Do you believe that people can actually be controlled. The audience will alway find a way to spread hate.

__label__Attack	I agree	haters may be removed is the system is able to identify them...so I think comment space can be kept but regulated 
__label__Attack	Removing all comments as a blanket measure is appropriate as it moves the conversations to other spaces. Newspapers should be for news, objective, they are no place for opinions	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	people naturally get angry so its difficult to reduce hate speech without any group being offended to some distinction	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	NHS is main priority for me too.	We really need to do much more here. But I feel things like solar farms are not the way, the batteries leak into water supplies etc, we need to look at new green ways 
__label__Support	I agree with this definitely. Let people comment but keep an eye on what people are doing by introducing moderators.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
