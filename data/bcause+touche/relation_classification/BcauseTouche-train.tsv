__label__Support	The EU has some rules on how social security systems are coordinated (Regulation 883/2004/EC). EU rules ensure that the pension rights accrued in each country are added together and paid out by the pension insurance institution of the Member State of affiliation. But the bureaucratic nightmare is probably just as guaranteed. A better solution would be a transparent and digital platform that collects pension entitlements from all EU member states. That way, every citizen would have an overview of his or her pension entitlements at all times, not just until when they are due.	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__Support	I find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice.

Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people
__label__Support	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people.

__label__Attack	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.	We do not want illegal migration.

__label__Support	Esperanto is politically neutral: it is not used by any European nation. Although there is some culture connected to the language, there is no political or economic power imposing it. Also, where English is connected to the US, Canada, Australia, and other countries, Esperanto would be a truly European language.	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities

__label__Support	Esperanto is linguistically neutral: The language was created with the principle of internationality in a European context. It’s democratic: There are no native speakers of Esperanto, or better yet not any monolingual speakers of Esperanto. Everyone has to learn it as a second language. As a result of this nobody will have an advantage over others and nobody can feel like a 'stranger' since nobody can feel like a 'native'. Everyone is respected regardless of their origin and not discouraged from learning the language.	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities

__label__Attack	Almost 3 lakh people were employed in the firecracker industry in these places, and 5 lakh people in packaging, transporting, distributing, and selling these crackers. Thus, the ban would also mean huge unemployment in these states.	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Attack	Bursting crackers on Diwali has always been on the to-do list in every family. A Deepavali without firecrackers will definitely be a cut-down in entertainment and recreation for the kids, as well as the elders.	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Support	Banning firecrackers in some places currently having pollution at its peak like Delhi-NCR will obviously bring down the poisonous emission of gases which has deadly effects on the entire balanced ecosystem. The highest level of particulate matter recorded in Delhi was 2.5 in the year 2016, which indeed made Delhi the most polluted city in the world in terms of air pollution. The “Central Pollution Control Board” also stated that the level of sulfur dioxide in the air gets tremendously high between 9 p.m. till midnight during Deepavali.	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Support	The crackers regulated in the market comprise chemical components like saltpeter, carbon, and sulfur. When these are ignited altogether, hazardous oxides of gases are emitted which cause suffocation, reduce visibility, and other health hazards. Medical experts state that the air gets contaminated with toxic gases and remains for days after Diwali. The toxic elements that reach the lungs, cannot be removed thereafter and can cause grave health issues. This will cause long-term effects on children.	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings
__label__Attack	With the ban, religious sentiments get triggered too. In 2017, the Hindu community raised questions about the ban on Christmas trees on Christmas, or slaughter of lamb on Eid, or colors on Holi, etc., thinking it to be against their communal practices.

__label__Support	As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.	The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe
__label__Support	Agreed, BUT only on one condition: that every euro be spent under the joint control of local and European officers.

__label__Support	I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East.

They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems.

This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment

__label__Support	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Support	Although there is an immense increase in the number of TCN migrant workers, there is no adequate policy in protecting their rights. Anyone in Europe should be entitled to the same worker’s rights, no matter where they come from. As migration is an issue that is dealt with by all countries, we must find a common answer at the EU level.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Support	The Dublin Agreement leaves EU member states with an external border completely alone to deal with the challenge of immigration. This must stop! Not only because solidarity in the EU is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overburdening of states left alone with this challenge creates intolerable situations for the refugees.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Attack	Before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have nice conditions in the EU, we should first focus on ensuring that our own people can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Attack	Each country must have the right to choose based on a democratic vote, how many immigrants they want to accept.

__label__Attack	Giving immigrants more rights will lead to the forced displacement and eventual erasure of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what's happening to the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China is genocide then so is this.

__label__Attack	We haven't got enough jobs and money for everyone in Europe! Stop immigration! However, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia have it! These countries can therefore welcome migrants instead of funding hundreds of mosques in Europe!	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__Attack	Why do we even let in migrants who do not speak the language of the country where they wish to reside? Migration is bad for the nations and degrading for the migrants. We must work to end mass migration.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__Attack	Indigenous Europeans have no obligation to take in any more migrants, and neither do they want to. This is being forced on us.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs
__label__Support	It's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).

It would be best that this is provided both in the person's mother tongue and in the language of the host country.	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs

__label__Support	Working in sectors in ample need of workers, such as the agricultural fields, will help to integrate immigrants once their situation has been legalized.

We prefer and are more comfortable with online chatting instead of talking to people for real. There are fewer meaningful relationships nowadays because of all the above factors. We have started preferring isolation.	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good
__label__Support	Nuclear technology is a very efficient alternative to non-renewable energy resources. But still, we chose to move ahead with more and more types of nuclear warheads. The same is the case with almost every other invention. Similarly, though initially, AI promised better lives for us, because of AI, we have started losing our basic human qualities.

__label__Attack	The British people voted for Brexit, so now naturally they have to live with their choice. It turns out you can't actually have your cake and eat it too.	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__Support	I think this is a good idea, but unfortunately it's framed as a British/brexit issue. However, the wider concept of a common EU visa / migration system is a compelling one. Harmonising the system to a common visa regime offers many advantages.	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__Attack	British people are not better than anyone else and do not deserve special treatment from the EU. The British people will face the consequences of their decision to leave the EU and it is not the EU's responsibility to make Brexit painless. The benefits of membership cannot be bestowed upon citizens of countries outside the EU/EEA, like the UK.	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights
__label__Support	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.

__label__Attack	It has been seen that it is difficult to retain employees in lean times when they are on variable pay schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when business is good, but they do poorly when business is bad. In times of slow business, even top salespeople might have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent living. If the market is slow and commissioned workers can’t earn enough, they may look for other employment opportunities. In lean times, fixed wages can be more effective at keeping employees from leaving for other opportunities.	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme
__label__Attack	Variable pay can lead to unhealthy competition between employees. They become less willing to help each other. Team co-operation may get affected negatively. In the long run, relations among colleagues may turn bitter. Whereas, in fixed pay schemes, the employees are able to maintain cordial relationships in the office.	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme
__label__Attack	Mostly, sales jobs have a variable component. This might negatively impact the employee’s attitude towards customers. They may force the customers irrationally just to make profits for themselves. They might overstate the price to the customers just to make more profit. Whereas, an employee with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relations with the customers, striking the right balance in their approach.

__label__Support	Since the invention of machines, the value of workers is decreasing. They are made to work to support the machines. As a result, work revolves around machines and not humans. Workers are forced to work continuously along with the machine.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	People are now engaging in trolling and cyberbullying. Hiding behind devices is giving them the courage to harass other people, which they may not do face-to-face. This is the deterioration of moral values.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	Some companies are building strategies to use their apps for a longer time, to keep us addicted to their apps and devices so that they can show advertisements to us. And also they can use our data to manipulate our decisions for their profits. These strategies are turning humans into just targets.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	Industrialization increased work hours. Workers faced inhuman conditions. Humans cannot work and focus continuously like machines. Fast forward to today, we have technological devices to check how many hours we actually work. Some companies want to be connected 24 hours a day through emails and messages. This makes people feel less human.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	Our decision-making skills are also getting affected as we are now asking search engines to know what is best. We are depending on the knowledge base of the internet even at offices to finish the work at hand. This affects cognitive skills ( to think, read, learn, remember, and reason), which is an essential quality of humans.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	Many face-to-face communications are also replaced with virtual interactions. Many people are now living in virtual homes, which is the smartphone. As the need for talking with each other is reducing, the ability to communicate with each other which is a basic quality of living beings is declining.	Technology is making us feel less human
__label__Support	We are increasingly depending on technological devices to guide us. For example, we keep reminders on smartphones and google the questions for answers.

__label__Support	sustainable and animal-friendly farms grow their own feed and create an ecological cycle.	Intensive livestock farming should disappear
__label__Support	The current subsidies with a modular system of incentives should be replaced, as that empowers farmers to choose environmentally, socially, and financially responsible and sustainable solutions that are already available - like natural sequence farming, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, etc.	Intensive livestock farming should disappear
__label__Support	In Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal feed. In determining how much subsidy a holding receives, the area of the holding is decisive. In other words, a lot of land, a large amount of subsidy. This results in cheap animal feed and, ultimately, intensive livestock farming. Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.	Intensive livestock farming should disappear

__label__Attack	The European Parliament has developed avenues for a common foreign and defense policy and should exercise its role this way.

__label__Support	I am all for the creation of a European army, but for that, the question of the command of this army must also be resolved. And this is where the idea of a European Security Council is very interesting and deserves to be pushed.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	I am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction. So NGOs and development cooperation must be involved. An army that can fight must also be able to build. We therefore also need a civilian army in Europe. I would also like an army consisting of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army. Please also take into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objection, also as in the German army.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	Absolutely right. Europe needs an army for continental defense. Conscription must be introduced at the European level. The army must have the most modern weapons to deter Russia, Turkey, and China.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	I agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	On the one hand, we have Russia killing countless Ukrainians and committing sabotage in Britain and the Czech Republic, and on the other hand, we have reluctant United States that is switching between isolationist and interventionist policies every 4-8 years. I stand convinced, that in order for the European Union to move forward, it must begin to introduce measures for the security of both, the current member states as well as the future member states that are endangered due to foreign aggression and bring the responsibility of continental safety firmly in our own hands. If Europe is to find the peace it must have the means to create peace by being able to protect itself against hostile foreign influences.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Support	The EU cannot endlessly lean on America or NATO. America has proven to be fickle and NATO has its own problems, such as Turkey, which is outside the EU and has threatened Greece. The EU needs its own independent solution.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states

__label__Attack	The World, in particular Africa and the Middle East, is experiencing a huge population explosion. They seem not to be able to cope with it as China did. Who is going to take all these millions of refugees which result from it? Also, consider that the integration of one non-western immigrant costs 167.000 euros. If the EU intends to survive it has to stop more or less all migration.	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy
__label__Support	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU. Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.	The EU should enforce minority protection
__label__Support	Unfortunately, the values and rights are interpreted and exercised differently in the states of the European Union. Whether we are speaking about minority protection, language rights, or cultural values. We can see every day that the EU is constantly retaliating against the Hungarians in Transylvania, when, despite the legislation in force, it ignores the lawlessness and atrocities committed against the Hungarians as a native minority. Furthermore, the European Union should give priority to all situations in which Hungarians in Transylvania are victims of discrimination.	The EU should enforce minority protection

__label__Support	The undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Support	Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Attack	Directly electing the president of the commission makes the most susceptible to political sway, which would kill the commission as a body of technical experts.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU

The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Attack	In Germany, the President of the Executive is not elected by the people directly either. The reason for this is the horrible experience during the Third Reich. The Parliament - as the only constitutional institution being directly elected - has a stronger stand if the President is not elected directly. However I definitely support, that the Parliament becomes stronger and more influential.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Attack	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Attack	The European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else. An elected head of the Commission would make nonsense of the principle of independence that is vital to the trust in the Commission's job. He or she would be beholden to the group that elected him or her and make the job impossible.	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU
__label__Support	European political parties should be independent of national parties.

__label__Support	The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__Support	Public services of good quality and universal access are key to ensuring fairer, more inclusive, and equal societies.

Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health

__label__Attack	At present, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure the security of data. On the other hand, developed countries already have an efficient infrastructure. So, rushing toward data localization may not be a wise step. Because without efficient infrastructure, the data is prone to cyber-attacks. And the risk is severe here because it is financial data. But as the laws are made, it is a big challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Attack	Storing data in India means higher operational costs for payment system operators. Because in other countries they have cheaper alternatives. And also for cross-border transactions, they have to store the data in two places, which increases costs. There is a probability that these extra costs may pass on to the consumers.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Support	Data localization laws result in the setting up of multiple data centers locally. This will create many jobs and will help the country’s economy immensely. It will also drive innovation in the field resulting in low-cost solutions.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Support	While investigating crimes, there will be a need to access the payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to take permission from that country for access to the data. This causes delays in solving crimes. If the data is stored here within our country, this problem will be avoided.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Support	India is a big consumer market for many foreign companies. So, India and other developing countries are realizing the economic value of the data and the importance of data localization. With data localization, domestic companies and the country’s economy will be benefited. And we can also ensure the security of the data.

__label__Support	Data is considered a ‘new form of wealth’. Generally, companies use data to understand the requirements of consumers and also to influence their behavior.

__label__Attack	We are in a globalized world. At present, the world is running on the free flow of people, goods, services, and data. Data localization laws seem to be a part of protectionist policies, which is a threat to the free flow of data.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Attack	The US is against data localization laws. Recently at the G20 summit, Donald Trump, the president of the US spoke against data localization. Its stance is natural because it increases the operational costs of US companies. India-US bilateral relations are important for both countries because we are intertwined in the export and import of IT services, professionals and goods, etc. So, imposing data localization laws without threatening Indo-US relations is another challenge.

__label__Attack	Data localization may result in government surveillance of its citizens.	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country

__label__Support	Europe was composed of 13 countries in 1870 and 23 in 1914. Maybe it's time to change borders without bloodshed.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	We live in the XXI century. We do not want any repression of peripheries by their state center. Within the European Union, we should welcome the blessing of decentralism and localism, including the self-determination of stateless peoples and stronger autonomies within confederal agreements. If not in Europe, where? If not now, when?	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR), ‘[a]ll peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The right to self-determination also has its economic content which gives the people the right to freely ‘dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law.'	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	Self-determination is a basic collective human right. Catalans practiced this right in 2017. Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence. Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start. If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially. This crucial step will enforce European democracy, the Democracy of Citizens that feel free and respected within European borders.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	Every nation with its own language and culture, which demands the same status as a sovereign nation within Europe, must have the right to be recognized and respected by people and other member nations/states.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	There are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	The right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	In a democracy, people have the right to decide on any issue that affects their lives. If more than half of the inhabitants of a region want to form an independent state, they have the right to do so. Going against it is going against the will of the majority of citizens, and therefore, against the very essence of democracy.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Support	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
__label__Support	France should offer its seat on the UN Security Council, so European interests are represented.	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

__label__Attack	Promoting, organizing, and directing mass migration is a crime against humanity. Lukashenko is currently committing exactly this heinous crime.

__label__Support	It is necessary that member states better share the efforts of receiving asylum seekers upon arrival at EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to frontline countries. The EU should develop a joint approach to support the frontline countries to assure that asylum seeker are provided adequate care, assistance, and protection upon arrival and are quickly distributed evenly throughout the EU for status determination.	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__Support	The root causes to leave their home countries should not be overlooked. The EU and its member states need to increase efforts to make the countries of origin more liveable.	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__Attack	Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications.

The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__Attack	This idea is what we have been doing for the last 30 years. It did not produce sufficient results to justify continuing on this path. It is just saying, that problem will solve itself. This proposition is harmful and does not stand on any data that could justify it.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__Attack	It is not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognizing patterns, reasons, and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in a vacuum. If it is easier and cheaper to live not sustainably, people will do it, even if they are conscious of the consequences.	The best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem
__label__Attack	We should arrange our cities, our economy, and politics so that it is easy for people to behave ecologically responsibly.

__label__Support	Intensive Care Medicine deserves to be added to the Annex V, as well as all citizens of the EU deserve top standards of critical care and safety when admitted to this demanding environment.	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists
__label__Support	The pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves. We saw patients in very critical condition being moved away from their families from one Member State to another to receive treatment while allowing the doctors to move would be much more efficient and less life-threatening for the patients.	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists
__label__Attack	I find the current actions of China to be incompatible with the ideology that the EU was formed and still has to this day, we can not have a relaxed attitude towards a country that sees all the world as competitors and enemies.	The EU should strengthen its relationship with China.

__label__Support	If all costs, including CO2 emissions of the production, the extraction of resources and its consequences for the region (environment and humans), ecosystem damage, recycling of the waste, and so on and so forth would be monetized and internalized in the costs of the products, many of our problems would be solved. It would simply make the more environmentally friendly products cheaper than the others and their production economically smarter.	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products
__label__Support	In a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products
__label__Support	why should every country in the EU be sovereign in energy production? Within the countries also not every region is sovereign in this sense. We need to take advantage of the geographic potentials of the european continent for pragmatic solutions	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states
__label__Support	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Support	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Support	It is absolutely necessary that we have a system of accountability, both for member states and other countries. Human rights and liberties always come first!	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Attack	The European Union is not a country and we must respect other countries' electoral choices.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	Mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	Several member states have been turned into dictatorships a year ago, and there is no sign of a return to democracy. Freezing temporarily their EU membership status is to be considered to those where there is no more freedom in crossing borders (BE), even inside borders (DE, FR), no more press freedom (most), no more debate (most), no more press or individual liberty.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	To have any credibility when addressing foreign countries regarding issues of human rights violations, curbs on the freedom of speech and press, democracy, and more, the EU must ensure that its Member States meet minimum standards on these fronts too.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Attack	The EU has no business 'promoting democracy' anywhere beyond its borders. Have we not seen sufficiently clearly in the past two decades where 'democracy export' leads?! Freedom bombs and human suffering everywhere. No, the EU must fully respect the sovereignty and national characters of all nations of this world. And that includes its own member states. The EU must immediately return to the letter of the EU treaties, and reaffirm in the strongest term the principles of conferral and subsidiarity.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	The EU should do it in an impartial manner and act against all countries regardless of political ideology. The EU should stand out to help all minorities and not just the politically advantageous ones. The oppression of Catalonians and Hungarian minorities outside its border is a constant problem since WW2 and it is completely ignored. If the EU wants to convince the masses, then it can't just cherrypick issues.	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders
__label__Support	Without a change in the voting procedure, Europe will not be capable of doing much in this world.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__Support	The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__Attack	The EU should not get involved in trying to ”spread democracy” with threats and punishments, leave that to the US.	Europe should change the world for the better for everyone.
__label__Support	The integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about. Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development? They are as much Europeans as we are.	The European Union shall guarantee its territorial integrity against threats from Russia and shall seek to eliminate the influence of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe.
__label__Attack	Do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately. The EU does not have an actual army - not because of bureaucrats but because our member states think they are better alone than united.	Europe should stand together!
__label__Support	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener. In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Support	The incentive to provide free public transport in European cities in the future would make it easier for people, especially in the cities, to accept and appreciate that there will be fewer and fewer cars. People who benefit from current examples are happy about it.	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Support	I think the EU should subsidies troubled cash-strapped cities to reduce ticket prices or completely remove any charges so that people are vivisected to hop on the bus rather than in the car. As I student, I would have been in the city center a lot more and spent money around the shops if I could afford the bus fair in the first place.	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Support	Such a platform if it provides youngsters with free or at least affordable mental-health assistance, will help them finally able to overcome our society’s barriers to taking care of our mental health and emotional well-being.	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__Attack	There is a reason why these states don't want to join the common currency: their economies are more flexible and doing far better without it. If we really want more countries to start using the euro, we need to make the euro better, not pressure or force others into our inefficient system.	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency
__label__Attack	We certainly need levels of government at the global, regional, and local levels. Equally, we absolutely need democracy at the global, regional, and local levels. Neither the European nor the national and regional parliaments should be abolished because of the need for global governance for the planet.	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government.
__label__Support	According to the United Nations Convention on the rights of people with disabilities, the European Union “shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities” on political decisions that concern them. Meanwhile the “European Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030” hardly mentioned people with intellectual and neurological disabilities. Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities. Ableism keeps getting perpetuated in the EU and it needs to stop. We want more representation! We want people with Down Syndrome to be fully included in the European Union institutions!	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	Aborting children with Down is not love, is not an inclusive society, it is discrimination against the most vulnerable.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	People with trisomy 21 in Europe have much higher rates of unemployment, social exclusion, poverty, and discrimination. The European Union must make it a priority to change this situation.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	Europe must lead the way when it comes to integrating people with Down syndrome	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	The United States is investing an average of more or less 25 million euros per year on health care research for people with Trisomy 21 while the European Union is lagging far behind with only 3 million per year. This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21.	People with disabilities should be more represented
__label__Support	A common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data. The data should be accessible for public research and used for monitoring public health e.g. by European institutions	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform

The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__Support	Juridical protection of dignity, right to life, and integrity of every human being from conception are of fundamental importance for the future of Europe. The dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle vs Greenpeace case, which recalls the definition of the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit that presuppose the destruction of human embryos.	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__Support	We are all here to fight the prohibition of eugenic practices such as abortion which organize and consequently encourage the preventive elimination of individuals who do not comply with the social, medical, and family criteria set by the ideal of man. What a perfect 21st century!	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health
__label__Support	From the Association Christian in Democracy (Spain), we are clear that life is the greatest good of a society and as such must be protected from its conception to its natural end. For this reason, it should be part of the European Union's charter of fundamental rights and be protected from attacks against defenseless human beings, such as in the cases of abortion and euthanasia.

__label__Attack	Consensual sex can also be termed as rape if the wife is willing to file a false case. There will be no proof to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men based on the mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.	Marital rape should be criminalized in India
__label__Attack	The most misused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to file a case on a husband and his family in case of dowry harassment. Many women are using this law to extort money and property from their in-laws. If the law on marital rape comes into effect, many innocent men will be at threat.	Marital rape should be criminalized in India
__label__Support	Sexual violence violates human rights, irrespective of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates against married women for using the section on their husbands. Though one can file a case under the domestic violence act for marital rape, not terming marital rape as a crime will deter the victims from filing cases. Every law on the planet is prone to be misused. That doesn’t mean that we should not have laws in order to avoid false cases.	Marital rape should be criminalized in India
__label__Attack	Article 15 of Indian constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender. But the proposed law on marital rape in the petitions recognizes only female victims. Hence it is discriminatory to male victims.	Marital rape should be criminalized in India

__label__Attack	Technical issues in banking can halt access to our money. This can interfere with our daily lives.	We should stop using cash
__label__Attack	No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget. And until the democratic deficit and other systemic problems in the EU are fixed, it's good that the budget is kept at 1-2% of the total EU GDP.	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.

__label__Attack	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__Support	Real democracy cannot do without economic democracy. If the major decisions about our future life (investments, inventions, production) are made outside social control, then there is no real democracy. Without proper social consultation, there is no prospect for a fair Europe.	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__Support	We need to strengthen citizens' trust in the European project! This requires more transparency and accountability, in particular when it comes to access to documents and democratic decision-making. The 'Better Regulation' approach of the Commission which focuses on cutting costs and burdens prioritizes business interests over general interests and should be abandoned. The European project needs to benefit the many and not the few!	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability

__label__Attack	Just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Attack	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries

__label__Support	Stop woke ideology introducing Orwellian newspeak!	EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen”
__label__Support	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate. The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country. There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes. Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__Attack	It's the same with citizens of the USA using Americans to describe themselves. Yes, technically it isn't correct, but who cares...	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU
__label__Support	The only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans. This must change.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__Support	The political composition of the European Council - and therefore the EU’s political center of gravity - continuously changes during the EU political cycle, thus preventing clearer government majorities to emerge within these two European Councils.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__Support	National elections synchronization would finally make it possible to strengthen the effectiveness of the Council of the EU, by eliminating the blockages caused by the constant renewal of Ministers, which considerably slows down decision-making.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__Support	Synchronizing national elections would allow European citizens to engage in major pan-European campaigns.	The EU should synchronize national elections
__label__Support	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__Support	Less disruption to public life, less road traffic, and less loss to our economy. As all the government staff can be used at a single time, we can also increase vigilance, and factors like black money, booth capturing, etc. can be reduced.	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Attack	Holding both elections together will also mean mixing up the national issues with those of the state. The national issues would overpower the state which in turn would get less priority from the politicians.	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Attack	When state elections are conducted along with the center the regional parties may get marginalized because the same party getting majority in the center may get votes in the state as well.	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Attack	Frequent elections in the country will bring politicians back to the public frequently whereas cutting down on elections would mean making them lazy for the rest of the term and suddenly becoming overactive during the election year.	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy
__label__Support	The cohesion funds have become a mechanism for local oligarchs and political elites to maintain their power and influence within national contexts, thus resulting in utilizing EU funds for their own personal or political gains and withholding the benefits from the people in cities and regions.	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__Support	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions
__label__Support	it is essential that environmental concerns and sustainability are the foundation of any treaty with our European Union!	Political institutions should make fundamental changes in the way they address climate change and environmental protection
__label__Attack	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__Attack	Migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.

__label__Support	The EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life. To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.
__label__Attack	Technology brings people together when they are distant, accelerates bureaucratic procedures, it allows us to work from home or from any country in the EU or outside. It allows for an immense flow of information to be easily accessible to us. As long as people do not want to do illegal online activities, it is each person’s individual decision what to do with their own online time or how much time they might want to be online.

__label__Attack	Forty years of UK membership in the European Union have clearly proven that it is not a good idea to conclude agreements with England.	The EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO

__label__Support	In fact, political NGOs advocating for any cause whatsoever should be banned from schools and kindergartens.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__Support	As Europe bears the burden of the XXth century authoritarian regimes (right and left) and saw their children ideologically possessed by fascist and communist governmental propaganda (Hitlerjugend (right) and Pioneer (left) movements), we need to limit the access of the children - as one of the most vulnerable groups of our community - to every political ideology and propagating associations.	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__Attack	This bill gave exclusive powers to the ‘National Investigation Agency’ (NIA). NIA can take any person into their custody under UAPA without taking prior permission from the state government. This is against the federalism, which is guaranteed by the constitution of India.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Attack	Labelling organisations as terror organisations and labelling individuals as terrorists are quite different. If a person is named as a terrorist, he/she will face social exclusion and will be devoid of livelihood opportunities even if he/she proved otherwise. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone 67% of the cases ended in acquittal, which means they are probably innocent.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Attack	If someone is booked under UAPA, the burden of proving their innocence is on them. This new amendment is enabling the government to seize their properties. Then how will they pay for legal expenses to prove their innocence, if they are falsely accused?	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Attack	This will provide more police powers to the central government. The provision of naming individuals as terrorists can be misused. For example, recently several civil activists are termed as Urban Naxals. If anyone opposes the government, they will be vulnerable to be framed as terrorists. Because this amendment made it easier to label anyone as a terrorist.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	There is a growing threat of lone-wolf terrorism. Lone wolf terrorists do not have any association with terrorist organizations, but they commit terror attacks alone by themselves. This new amendment to UAPA has the potential to curb lone-wolf terrorism.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	To prevent the violation of human rights, four-stage scrutiny is added. Designating individuals as terrorists is not started by India. The US, European Union, and China also have this provision.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	Till now, only organizations were designated as terrorist organizations, but not individuals. The loophole in this is the individuals of the banned organizations are forming new organizations and carrying out terror activities. This amendment bill for the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists, thereby terror attacks can be prevented.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	There is a need to act tough on terrorism amid growing threats from terrorists. So, strengthening UAPA is necessary.	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	Refugees are forcibly displaced. They flee their country for several reasons such as violence, human rights violations, war, persecution of minorities, etc. Often they face threats to life in their home countries. They leave their homes and everything else in search of a safer place to live.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	At present, many countries are refusing refugees stating that they pose an economic or security threat. Only a few countries including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Liberia are accepting most of the refugees. Some host countries are forcibly sending refugees back to their home countries stating that such as the situation in their home countries is safe. Many refugees who were sent like this went through brutal violence and some people even disappeared.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	All countries should share the responsibility for refugees. Resettlement of the refugees should be done without much delay. They should be provided with skill development courses and employment opportunities to help them in living a dignified life.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	A weak global response is worsening the situation of refugees. The international community should help in rebuilding the war-torn countries, where refugees are coming from, so that safe and dignified returns are possible for refugees. Refugees should not be forcibly sent to their home countries.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	Many developed countries are spending so much money to protect their borders, but are not spending any money for protecting the lives of refugees. More funding is required to protect refugees.	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees
__label__Support	This is especially true when we know how much alcohol is damaging the brain, in particular in the developing brain of teenagers. Also unlike cannabis, over-consumption of alcohol leads to death so I would say that this product is much more dangerous. Yet unlike cannabis, alcohol is legal.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Support	In France, political repression fueled by rightwing ideology and ignorance led cities like Marseille to develop rampant crime that fed on the lucrative market of cannabis. Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Support	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Support	Today, cannabis repression is simply a political posture aimed to target rightwing voters, not a rational policy.	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.
__label__Support	Whenever you find yourself in crisis, and the EU is in crisis, it is a good idea to return to core business. And in the case of the EU, the core business is economy, trade, and security. That's where the focus should be.

__label__Attack	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU. The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU. Almost all people are without a useful education. There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing

The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat
__label__Attack	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced. When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat

It would cause so much more bureaucracy 2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat? 3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.

__label__Support	These days, every man is considered as a potential rapist. If a woman makes a false molestation complaint against a man out of revenge or any other motive, society is more likely to believe the woman's words. Society and media exposes the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in genuine cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However the same is not true with the complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt about the genuinity of the case. What if the sexual harassment case against the man is a false case? Some people think like men can take anything. False molestation cases will result in the irreversible loss of reputation and causes mental agony to the accused and his family.	Men are silent sufferers in this modern world

And the saddest thing is that girl can complain against her sister-in-law and sister-in-law's husband too under domestic violence, even if they are not staying at her place. Women can be as cruel as men in harassing their life partner.	Men are silent sufferers in this modern world

If you insist on a set of shared EU principles and values that go beyond a mere symbolic declaration, these principles and values must include our real heritage: the Judeo-Christian values that have made Europe great. Traditional family values are first and foremost. All these values must be clearly defined in a legal sense.	The European Union, as a Union of values, should limit its support to countries that do not want to adhere to European values and violate the rights of their citizens
__label__Support	Why everything is seen in a sexual nature? Brahmacharya doesn't mean women cannot worship god. Brahmacharya means observing celibacy. It doesn't mean that there shouldn't be female devotees of reproductive age. Narrow-minded people do not understand the difference between devotion and sexual attraction.	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions
__label__Support	Some other temples also ban women, and some temples ban men. If it is the same situation with Sabarimala, people wouldn't have bothered about it.

Not allowing menstruating women in temples sends a wrong message to people and future generations.	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions

__label__Support	Transparency is the first key to real democracy. Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings. Or think about all the meetings between diplomats (Coreper) and civil servants (working groups and committees), where ±90% of decisions are made, for the Council to be rubberstamped. Meetings that most citizens don't even know about.	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press

The green transition should not be a heavy burden borne on the average citizen’s shoulders	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy
__label__Support	As Yuval Noah Harari says “What we need now are morality and spirituality. Morality is about reducing suffering in the world. And spirituality is about questioning and looking for answers. Religions provide us just with answers and no scope of questions.”	The world does not need religion anymore
__label__Support	Religion has served its purpose of uniting people, setting up structures in society, and developing trust and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are thriving towards objective realities, and religion is an inter-subjective reality and now the only thing it does is create differences in the world, brainwash people, develop animosity for other beliefs, and provide rituals that are just shortcuts to becoming a good person. (A Muslim may pray 5 times a day; a Hindu may pray daily for hours in temples; a Christian may go to church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities).	The world does not need religion anymore
__label__Support	In the past, every unknown thing dealt with religious beliefs. But now Science & Technology has taken over everything.

__label__Support	Indians as a whole consider educational institutions as job machines, we expect to enter unemployed and come out with employment. We don’t realize that we will have to upgrade our skills to become worthy of employment. This is the reason that more than 80% of engineers are unemployable and the figures are even worse for the non-engineers.	We should subsidize higher education institutions
__label__Support	Though we have been establishing national-level institutes for the past 40 years, we haven’t been investing to maintain their standards. Funds are needed for quality education. Even the top Indian institutes lack proper infrastructure, labs, resources, etc. And even whatever is available is just for the sake of passing the students in the examination and sitting idle the rest of the time.

This way, we can establish a single common market.	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union
__label__Support	With highly subsidized agricultural products the EU destroys local markets in African countries. This procedure should be stopped as soon as possible.

Also, this will lead to a better relationship with African Union and enable better livelihoods for African farmers and citizens,	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union
__label__Support	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas.

__label__Attack	The intention of helping a country with democratization can easily be used to justify violent actions.	We need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy.
__label__Attack	'We most definitely do not need a wider definition of 'gender-based' anything. 'Gender' is a politicized left-wing concept. I certainly encourage wider protection from violence against women and girls. That should most definitely include protection from the violence and coercion young women face from 'trans' activists. We also want nothing to do with 'intersectionality' which is a neo-Marxist concept of overlapping oppressions. No one is being oppressed in Europe.

__label__Attack	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__Support	Having laws in place should ensure that hate speech is discouraged or punished	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up

__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?

__label__Attack	You may argue that it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police their comment sections. Having said that, perhaps the relevant question you should be asking is whether it is in their best interests to do so. That is, even if it's not their moral obligation, it may STILL be in their financial and functional best interest to do so. The prevalence and salience of hate speech may signal to audiences that the newspaper tolerates (at best) and endorses (at worst) the hateful commentary appearing in their comment section. How do you think this would impact the bottom-line of the bottom line of said newspaper company? I would argue: Not well. And how do you think this would impact the ability of said newspaper to reach future audiences? I would argue: Not well. Individuals disgusted by the appearance of hate speech may be at an increased probability of avoiding said newspaper website in the future on moral grounds. Consider, for example, individuals who boycott Nestle for ethical reasons.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	Fixing the root cause would be most beneficial.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	this may clash with the need to preserve heritage buildings.	It’s a matter of respect, to call a person the way ji wants to be called
__label__Attack	This is quite possibly the worst excuse to defend the current government. 	needs funding and making more efficient
__label__Attack	I think that you're right.  I'd rather have the hate speech than restrict free speech.	There is a fine line between free speech and hate speech. I don't think there is any way to reduce this because people will take the stand and say that their free speech is being taken away from them.
__label__Support	I think hate speech should not be accepted . If its published on news platform then that signifies that its is condoned!	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	Agree completely	Cost of living is way too high, also re-privatise the Rail lines, Gas, electric, as these are run by greedy big companies
__label__Support	I agree with this sentiment as people will be more conscious of their opinions.	I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__Attack	However, I tend to agree with this opinion: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php . I don't think hate speech will end with the end of anonymity. We have to think about the possibilities of safety for human rights activists that only come with anonimity.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	Free speech is a thing	Strict content moderation
__label__Attack	The algorithm could be really bad at catching irony which can be really harmful as well.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	absolutely, they need to show that we can trust them now. they have a lot to prove 	tories can be such hypocrites let alone the extreme right, their effect has been devastating all over the globe!
__label__Attack	While I agree, there are a lot of things that have to happen first before this can become a reality. We have to rework gas stations around the country so that they have the charging stations necessary for electric vehicles and we have to build the charging stations near highways and thoroughfares for those same electric cars so that the future infrastructure is ready to handle the influx of electric cars before demanding they be manufactured at such a high rate. 	electric vehicles should be consider as mandatory by the major fuel consumption nations 
__label__Support	I definitely agree with this. The website itself should take some responsibility as to what appears on the site. Offensive behaviour should not be permitted.	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__Attack	What if the moderators are biased themselves?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I think having the viewer agree to use respectful language before they are taken to the comment section could have some minor benefits.	By not providing comment section not unless the article need their opinion. There'll be a note notifying readers to be well mannered.
__label__Support	i think so too, there must be software to instyruct an algorhythm to pick out certain hate words and delete the comment	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.
__label__Support	Stops the bullying and people feeling bad	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I completely agree with this. This will make an open space for people to leave their comments but also make sure that everything is checked before its posted.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I don't believe the comments section should be removed as everyone is entitled to a voice	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship.  I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it.  Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.  Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy.  They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__Attack	However, by doing that you may be limiting people's ability to express themselves positively too	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__Attack	The requirement of a phone number is a reasonable one, but might restrict participation (i.e. there will be people who are unable or unwilling to give their phone number just to comment on a newspaper website). An alternative approach could be to enforce a 'waiting time' from account creation to the ability to post comments? This would prevent repeat offenders from simply creating new accounts after they were banned	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments, banning repeating offenders and requiring a phone number to create a account.
__label__Attack	A small amount of dairy and eggs is quite sustainable. The author is conflating large scale meat farming with small scale milk and egg production.	I believe thats an accurate solution 
__label__Support	I understand why people dont bother, it can seem pointless to people because little seems to change. 	Immigration is crucial to everything - can't run a country properly with all the services we need with crazy numbers 
__label__Attack	The poor behavior is others is not obviously a good reason to emulate it. Even without sufficient action from other countries, the US is big enough to have a huge impact, in terms of GHG reduction and technology development, all on its own.	I don't have a hard stance on this because I do not feel knowledgeable enough about the issue to say for sure what my ideal solution would be. I agree it is a gigantic problem that needs to be met with urgency and importance by all of us. I don't know that we could reverse climate change, it seems most damage has been done, but I'm hopeful taking stronger actions now would at least help reverse some things, and prevent current issues from developing further. It's worth trying.
__label__Attack	It's a good idea, but too many get giddy at trying to break rules and in doing so, ruin things.	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__Support	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.	In order to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. Active communinty management and moderation is required. This helps keep people in line with the community guildelines.
__label__Attack	stand up to the french and send them back	Probably not. Most elections are really a case of trying to pick the best of a bad bunch. 
__label__Support	We can never run away from hate speech	Hate speech will forever be a problem in society and its up to the newspapers website to make sure they publish newsworthy news that even if they come across negative comments, they know that on their side their story is true and there a no loopholes
__label__Attack	I think people are so wary of giving personal information out online that this would put people off commenting and while this might deter 'keyboard warriors' who are happy to hide behind a screen I dont think it would be helpful to have the threat of being tracked down. It feels very big brother coercive and could potentially lead to people feeling attacked which may make them lash out but also feel justified in their opnions	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Attack	All in all, the newspaper comment section should not be cancelled.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	Where I live that is the only option in any election	Those are key factors for me too but unfortunately the major parties have not really about them! 
__label__Attack	it has to be completely restricted	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	I think that this is correct but mst places have a law or legal guideline as to what it considered hatespeech n that country	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__Support	I agree as many news papers in our days don't have comment sections as it is expensive and time consuming	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I think people may give false information (data)	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Attack	Costs money... 	Trust and integrity is vital
__label__Attack	This may negatively impact the public. As newspapers may publish news in a manner deceiving the truth and those who are not aware would believe lies.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Very funny.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I agree! 	I think the lazy brits that sit on their backsides, smoking/vaping and watching Sky tv should get off their backsides and fill these jobs - stop giving them money for doing nothing 
__label__Support	Yes -  utilisation of private healthcare is the only logical way to cut waiting times. 	So who will it be when the votes are collected? 
__label__Support	I have to agree with that take, I feel like it could be quite dangerous for UK to get closely involved, do not need a war.	I am not sure who is responsible for enforcing the legislation?
__label__Attack	but AI is still weak right now to filter hate speech comments efficiently	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__Support	agree, 14 years of government and theyve wrecked the quality of life for many people at the benefit of others	This software has stopped working for me
__label__Attack	We are out - its one - do it properly now	Economy, NHS, immigration and inflation.
__label__Support	Having rules will make online engagement respectful.	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__Attack	If facts are given sources should be used to back this up.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Support	makes the comments more welcoming to everyone	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__Support	What about it? more money for education? change the curriculum?  	They've both had a chance to prove themselves - they've both had a chance to show consistency over policies. Neither have. 
__label__Attack	The dangers of allowing free speech has been constantly seen in different moments. A recent time was when Donald Trump Instigated riots in America, causing damage to buildings and applauding it... making it worse and worse	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Would make less people with no intention of harmful comments interact as they will be fearful of giving out personal data.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Attack	I've heard this idea of safe routes for migrants. Britain is an island so literally the only way to get here is by boat.	Also a lot of waste
__label__Attack	This is like saying if there are less weeds in the garden there is less work. The weeds grow. We have to address the weeds.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	There are some good points however in having news sites require users to submit data they risk each users' privacy and right to anonymity. This could be increadibly dangerous and would encourage people to stop using the site	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Support	Agreed, but social housing has to be just as important because house prices for 1st timers will continue to rise if there's still a shortage. 	You are conflating two issues , enviromnet and climate change
__label__Attack	yeah they can, but certain AI can be added on newspapers websites to detect and remove hate speech.	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__Attack	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Support	glad the numbers are low. also you have to blame the voters for not doing their research and supporting idiots 	It's lack of investment in training. We can't keep letting our country poach other people's trained doctors and nurses to save money.
__label__Attack	I have changed my vote for the first time in my life - voted by post. I am totally disenchanted by the depressing standard of human being that is offered by the two main parties.  They never answer questions and swerve with their repetitive rhetoric. They take the public for fools and wind their sentences away from every question. How can ANYONE believe in those kinds of people.  They are out for themselves ONLY.	Because zero hour contracts aren't good for people who want to work full time hours. A mortgage advisor is hardly going to think you are an ideal buyer.
__label__Support	AI is the way to go for sure since there it's not human-based	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__Support	This would eliminate inappropriate comments	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__Attack	I believe if almost everyone who knows about hate speech will know what to say  and what not to say.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Would also LOVE this. Brexit has screwed my entire industry (touring musician) over 	yes but we seem to be letting the worst of them who are not wanted in their home countries - most are comming for the money and not to try to integrate or make britain a better place
__label__Support	Whether or not it is a hoax, human having rational thinking he have the guilty when he affect the environment with pollution like fumes, industrial wastes and other things damaging the society.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology 
__label__Support	All of those yes, but has Labour got those covered I don't think any of them know what they are doing now 	Not more funding, but better use of the money they have.
__label__Support	You are right. The problem is slowly growing which is why we need to take steps to address it now.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	I think DominicJ is onto something however with technology being on our finger tips and Artificial intelligence making things easier i think having a software that can be able to restrict those criteria can be a good thing and will be automated	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	I agree	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Support	Definitely, which party do you think would be best for the task? 	I am not sure who is responsible for enforcing the legislation?
__label__Support	involved	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__Attack	A party that encourages personal responsibility, and that ain't Labour	Essentially agree on all of these plus add the NHS and social care
__label__Attack	Society needs to change, desperately	It doesn't matter whos in power, they all sing off the same hymn sheet 
__label__Support	That can come with an advantage since people would feel more scared of repercussions in case they do harm other people (basically, if not by empathy, then we use the law).	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	I completely agree!	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__Attack	The conservatives have had 14 years in power, and 5 elections, this is not jumping ship, this is an attempt to fix the problems they have caused 	needs funding and making more efficient
__label__Attack	Stops hates speech	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Stronger action could damage EU-Israel relations	There is a need for better regulation and control of social media and AI
__label__Support	I agree - some of the highest earners have been quoted as saying they are willing to pay more in tax. 	Yes, absolutely. 
__label__Attack	I agree with you but there would have to be a lot of work put into the filters as people do get around them and still are able to make their hateful points using text speak or misspelling ever so slightly.  This is just something that would have to be considered.	"In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check ""users"" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help"
__label__Attack	I don't think this would a particularly helpful thing to do. Comment sections help readers make their contribution(s) to the discourse. Perhaps the development of algorithms that work through the comments to identify what's inappropriate and remove it.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	It may require significant political will and budget to implement	European countries should recognize the State of Palestine
__label__Support	they need to make it easier for a young person to buy a house 	"NHS reform is important, but needs more management (it's well below levels in comparable systems), more investment, and greater integration into the social care system. ""Efficiency"" is used to imply fewer managers and admin staff, which is the opposite of what is needed. We need to free up frontline staff from needing to manage and do admin."
__label__Support	It is nice to think we could reduce hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Dental care is, as my NHS care was taken away. 	none of them seem to be honest  
__label__Attack	Yes, I totally agree with this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	to disallow readers comments is an unnecessary response as these communities can still be found elsewhere	"The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of ""cognitive dissonance"" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context."
__label__Attack	True but we need to set an example as if we discard such an important issue, other countries will take that as an excuse to do nothing	Cost of Living crisis
__label__Attack	Education is a great tool but essentially your website gives the solution without the steps. First people need to learn how to disarm the person they're debating with to educate them, which most people don't have the finesse to do. How do you change someones views when they're defensive from start to finish of your conversation?	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it.  https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__Attack	Hateful comments should allow respondents to persuade otherwise.  Comments can be a good force for change and shouldn't be cancelled.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Moderators will allow for fair reviiews	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__Support	i think this would be a good thing and i totally agree - free speech without hate should be and is possible.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I don't think that's true anymore - working in a large corporation, 5 years ago, we would have never talked about sustainability, been willing to pay more for anything sustainable, or frankly, really been concerned. Now, we have no real choice - consumers are simply demanding it.	This conversation seems to be pointless as our opinions will probably never be heard by those who are in control and authority and by big government who controls the people. They are the ones that need to hear and listen to the  people through forums and discussions
__label__Attack	I don't think dated attitudes are the issue in the NHS so much as it all comes down to lack of resourcing. I've spoken to many people working there who also work in the private sector and they are absolutely capable of using modern technology. They just don't have access to it and overhauling system costs money. 	But first and foremost you have to agree with what theyre promising
__label__Support	https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__Support	I completely agree with this. There are multiple exposes and car engineering shows were independent organizations show not only that we can reduce carbon emissions, but that we can also run cars way more efficiently with our current fossil fuels. If people demand the same level of efficiency with future fossil fuel using vehicles we can begin to make real changes. This will in turn give us the time necessary to begin building the infrastructure necessary for those alternative fuel sources as we will need to build electric gas stations and charge stations around the country before demanding an increase in those alternative vehicles from organizations.	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.
__label__Attack	a total media distraction from the far far bigger issues in the country on NHS, housing, roads, education. people get sucked into the nigel farage / priti patel nonsense that this is a huge issue when it isnt.  	The economy, health and immigration
__label__Attack	Too big a problem to deal with	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Since most of the climate change is caused by big organisations, I dont think just adapting to climate change is the right thing to say. There is a lot that is out of our hands.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers. The only purpose they serve is announcing your views to everyone else reading the same article. It's unnecessary and people's opinions are rarely changed by what they read in the comments section from some random reader/commenter.	I was completely taken aback by  some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__Support	"""E.g. rebound effect."" (Crispin Edwards) "	Maybe we should prioritise ergonomic chairs
__label__Attack	yes this absolutly true, newspapers should not be acting like the censorship police	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	It is politically incorrect  to defy people their freedom of speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Support	I agree with moderation and the need for education and increased open-mindedness and respect	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	They should still be responsible for their words, as they are adults, so surely they know what they are doing.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	unfortunately, people may continue to not adhere with the proper language of communication under comments.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__Attack	What crisis?	Please vote! Even if you go against the grain
__label__Support	Hate speech is not acceptable and this would help to prevent the  possibly of appearing online.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	In a fast moving comments section with lots of commentators it would be impossible to moderate in real time.	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle.  Needs real time moderation.
__label__Support	Avoids AI filtering out free speech	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__Support	I'd like to see new parties formed like in France but our voting system stops that happening	We owe our future generation the responsibility of keeping the planet safe for them, this is a non-negotiable obligation.
__label__Attack	infringing on free speech	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	is half an hour would be sufficient for that? it might take more time for people to get together into groups 	There are risks of AI being used maliciously in deliberation processes
__label__Support	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.	I believe that all types of hate speech should be removed. All comments should be pre assessed by an overlooked before comments are posted. We should still be able to comment and have freedom of speach to express an opinion, but no hate speech.
__label__Attack	If we don't ask corporations to step in and get involved, then we're ignoring the biggest contributor of this issue - EVERYBODY needs to be involved. 	Rich nations rigged poor (powerless) nations. By choosing bio-fuel or dams solutions they just sentencing poor nations to extinction

__label__Attack	hate speech will take over the comment section. it is as the website owner to instate policies.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	This is probably the optimal solution, but it  also requires a lot of work force and might be quite expensive, too.	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__Support	The cost and amount  of management  in NHS is a scandal	I used to vote Green because I care about the environment. Now they rarely mention that - they seem more concerned about men who think they are women and prioritise them over the rights of women and girls
__label__Attack	Everyone should be included in dialogue, not just the middle	We should focus communication efforts on the middle ground rather than extreme positions
__label__Support	I think it is a good idea to be able to flag the comment so moderators can review it	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	"""EU is going to give a carbon credit for buildings that have been there for a long time"" (Peter Cox)"	we shouldn't be worried about ai because it creates jobs regardless if a lot of people lose their jobs
__label__Attack	Removing the comment section will not prevent hate speech from occurring. People will find an alternative online platform, e.g. forums. Instead, companies should focus on moderating the comment section/providing links as to why posts that may be flagged are harmful. We need to focus more on prevention as opposed to reaction.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	how do you regulate what hate speech is and who by?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Some comments can be seen as hate speech but they are not hate speech. They will be taken down and that will prevent freedom of speech	Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__Attack	I agree that in removing hate speech there is a chance that we could be silencing valid criticism and curtailing freedom of speech. However, I do think that sometimes there can be a fine line between criticism and hate speech and I would much rather see valid criticism removed than to see hate speech spread.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree because it will be easy to identify hate speech like this without completely taking away the ability to express opinions	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases

__label__Attack	i enjoy reading comments but some comments can be sweary,name calling, troll like behaviour, which should be stopped.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Support	i agree	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post.  Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)

__label__Attack	Everyone has an opinion, and I agree that no one should be silenced. However I do not believe that the comment section of a newspaper article is where people should have the freedom to write hate	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree, hate speech needs to be dealt with from the root of the problem, it is not the responsibility of news services to police this.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	Agreed, we don't want tax increasing. NHS could do with some work too. Even pensions are getting taxed ?!?!	I think AI is going to become a big problem over the next year and this needs to be closely monitred and safe huarded
__label__Attack	I think this could be a good idea, but people will probably eventually find workarounds to avoid the censoring (as seen with spam bots using alternate characters in Youtube comments for example)	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__Attack	Climate Change is the main issue  It causes a lot damage to our environment  Thanks to some of the volunteers who are helping to fix the issue by sharing the issues in mass media to cover up a lot of people 	Maybe. But all humanity should collectively act together with the lead of the big super powers. If USA and China stay out, I am afraid it would be useless
__label__Support	Less Issues with arguments and trolls	I think it is ok to remove the comments. There are other places people can go to express opinions.
__label__Attack	what is considered non-beneficial to a discussion. (there becomes an issue with bias and matter of opinion)	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Yes! Absolutely correct! 	But many people who want to work aren't able to because they have conditions that would be treatable but massive NHS backlogs have stopped them getting the help they need

__label__Attack	People still need the comment section since it allows for open conversation and allows for people to find like mnded individuals.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	Firtly, i think the newpaper need to acknowledge the concern of hate speech. And is importnant because we can never fully avoid it. So the newspaper should have a platform support people who are targets of hate speech.	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__Attack	Nice point	Hate speech is hidden love that is just imperfectly expressed and should be protected 
__label__Attack	The scots already had their independence vote - do you want to keep running one until you get the answer you want?	Would provide personalized, relevant information to citizens
__label__Support	I think an AI could be very useful as well because it would take emotion out of equation when reaching decisions about what speech should be weeded out.	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist.  Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with.  But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged.  There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__Support	What will take place tomorrow will be theatre. The problem is the system as a whole. The real power lies with the banks and financial institutions.

__label__Support	"""Tools for homeowners, assessors, planners etc - STBA and others"" (Crispin Edwards)"	Not exaclty, you can't talk in a way that hurts other people
__label__Attack	AI is a good solution but it can not detect hate speech that is in certain languages, currently AI can not translate all the languages spoken in the world.	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__Support	Agree. Certain words can be filtered and if triggered comment can be removed	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__Support	Agreed, more understanding and education are always good for society. Moderation functions as a good intermediary for discussion.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__Support	I agree 100%. And to add people should be asked to explain their comments. Most hateful comments are just people trolling and looking to cause a stir.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Support	agree with this! Lack of education is often the biggest culprits when it comes to hate speech - many people are scared of things they don't know about.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	I agree with Ian. It has real life consequences. It is important that moderators can identify hate speech, that is not free speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Who decides what is categorised as Hate Speech?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this point because I think freedom of speech is fundamental in a modern and democratic society but at the same time we cannot avoid the fact that online hate speech have become a problem and we should deal with it	Human-based detection exists for certain content, but represents a really high cost for companies.

Also, the whole ""state control"" meme seems to be disingenous: in times of great crisis the state not only may but MUST intervene for the safety and security of all. That is the core reason for the state to exist."	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.

__label__Support	yes true i find no one really reads those comments anyways	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__Attack	Lack of employment rights and guaranteed pay for those that need it. You're lucky to be in a position where it does not matter as much	That's an excellent point in fairness.

__label__Attack	not true	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Less consumers/readers/	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.

__label__Support	It's true that this would eliminate hate speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Under current laws, restauranters are responsible for hate speech among their diners, so I certainly think platform owners should be responsible for the presence of hate speech on their websites.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Absolutely, hate speech forms thoughts, which forms character which leads to violent actions with enough time. It's a very serious issue that causes real world harm to marginalized communities when left unchecked.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__Attack	I believe that most people actually do realize the damage that hate speech can cause and are either deliberately using a platform to incite violence/harm/distress or just don't care as they dont see the people they are using hate speech against as being worth feeling for.

__label__Attack	I can understand the reason why that might remove some of the problem, but that argument is a bit like saying, some roads frequently experience traffic jams, so let's get rid of all the cars.

__label__Support	I definitely agree with your position, a certain level of regulation is needed, as looking at the current situation there are still many problems regarding online comments.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	There should be a warning to ban the account of someone who uses hate words in the comment section.	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__Support	If a media regulate how people respond to their news, they can aid the fight against hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

Rich countries support it as a cheap form of energy, yet it has a high CO2 profile 
__label__Support	I actually really like this idea - it deals well with the issue of removing hate speech as nothing just gets automatically published and checked later. Yes it will cut down on the amount of comments overall but even that isn't a bad thing, if only the most coherent, high-quality comments are published.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Support	Yes, completely agree and efficiency in police work to allow meaningful work - yes paperwork and accountability needs to be done but why not restructure with more admin staff? also mental health service to free the police to concentrate on crime.

__label__Support	I think so too. But would that not further allow for subjectivity to cloud ones judgement(the moderator)? I propose there be a guideline set as to what qualifies for hate speech, both by law and by the standards of the newspaper. That guideline should be posted in the newspaper or on the social media platforms and that will ensure that there is no grey area on the matter.	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	This is a fine point. Though if I take a more literal stance, this kind of deletion wouldn't happen as the moderators wouldn't accept it in the first place?

__label__Support	Totally agree. It still gives space to express but will limit the hate speech	We should all have the option to voice our opinion.

__label__Support	Yes, and also being able to see a GP, not having to wait 2 weeks just to get a phone call	there are countries where people are not allowed to vote democratically and corrupt leaders just put themselves in charge.

__label__Attack	Aggression is a subjective aspect. Someone may be expressing themselves passionately, but is seen as aggressive. Cultural differences and misinterpretation of words and intent can also influence opinion of a comment's 'aggression'.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I'm not very sure that an automated system is the answer. There are many cases of false positives, particularly when other users attempt to have a discussion with the offender.

I think there must be a system that will detect hateful comments and block them.
__label__Support	There should already be policies that hinder hate speech as it seems that the problem is escalating	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	I agree with this. With that being said, we as consumers need to demand more from the same organizations.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__Attack	I don't think algorithm can accurately detect hate speech.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is already defined in law in many countries. As its already a criminal offence , the existing legislation provides the definition of hate speech, and blueprint to follow.	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.

__label__Attack	I like the idea of AI. but it still seems to fail a lot of the time: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__Support	I totally agree!	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__Support	I do think that people just comment on things even if they don't have a strong opinion about it, just because it's easy to. This is why I feel they wouldn't act out in another way if the commenting platforms were taken away, as they inherently don't actually feel passionately about an issue enough to put energy into opposing it.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__Support	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

Maybe it will protect sites that use it, but otherwise, people will still find racism online. And maybe that's not the responsibility of the news site, but I find it disheartening still.	"In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to ""teach"" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate.

__label__Support	I completely agree with this. There are multiple exposes and car engineering shows were independent organizations show not only that we can reduce carbon emissions, but that we can also run cars way more efficiently with our current fossil fuels. If people demand the same level of efficiency with future fossil fuel using vehicles we can begin to make real changes. This will in turn give us the time necessary to begin building the infrastructure necessary for those alternative fuel sources as we will need to build electric gas stations and charge stations around the country before demanding an increase in those alternative vehicles from organizations. 	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.

__label__Support	Exactly! It's not true democracy. 	Better foresight could help prepare for crises
__label__Attack	"I think it's a little more nuanced than curtailing freedom of speech. If we define the right to free speech as ""the right to speak, write, and share ideas and opinions without facing punishment from the government"", you have to consider that news websites and social media are not moderated by the government or required to allow freedom of speech.  If a news website is to be truly impartial, I don't personally believe that opinions of the layman provide any benefit and can often be harmful.  That however, is only my opinion ;)"	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	Rules will need to be put in place to make this work. But I agree it's worthwhile.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Realistically this would probably work, but it would no doubt still have problems like people raising issues of 'suppressing free speech' etc.	i think one of the best ways is to allow everyone  a free space of commenting yet making sure that all the hate speech is automatically blocked no one can see those comments except the administrator
__label__Support	This is exactly what should happen in all comments section! Only then people will learn to be respectful of others	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	Immigration affects all those issues	The economy, health and immigration
__label__Support	"In the book ""Noise"" it talks about taking the median for everyones view and making that the regulation. The conversation then becomes which views qualify as each end of this opinion spectrum? Surely not the hateful ones but a modicum of their views so they feel included instead of fuelling their distrust of systems not built for them."	"I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that ""less restricted"" criteria should be?"
__label__Attack	That's a huge investment when we do have other issues in the world to deal with first.	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Attack	who decides which words are to be blocked and which are not, some people may find certain words offence while others may not.	by not allowing certain words to be used in the comments space
__label__Support	I agree having an algorithm to delete specific words and phrases.	I think you could ban some words or have someone checking the comments and deleting the ones that are unappropiate, but limiting the whole comment section would be a mistake
__label__Support	I think it is useful to read others opinions & points of view on various topics. It would deny people possible education to take this away.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	It could be done manually at first but then an AI machine could learn from the manual responses to determine what is considered hate speech	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	I think you have hit the nail on the head here!	educate young  people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards
__label__Attack	regardless of the nuance in hate speech, a platform can still manage it effectively using the laid out definitions but also can fill some of the gap by having a wider language policy that also includes the use of threatening and aggressive language	Hate speech can mean different things to different people
__label__Attack	No room for intelligent discussion	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	c onsidering that information, and the hate speech which is still on Facebook - is AI able to work effectively?	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__Attack	already said	have word filters
__label__Support	i think  this is correct but i do feel that there is more that technology can do to help these days too	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	That's really your biggest concern?	I agree but it has been so run into the ground i don't knwo how we are going to get it back to a good place to live and work again .
__label__Support	"Yes most of them are career politicians and never had a ""real"" job outside of politics "	Foresight capabilities already exist but are not always heeded
__label__Attack	Moderator biases	There need to be some kind of moderation, either before or after comments are published

__label__Support	I agree-it it fundamentally wrong that people who are on benefits are better off than those who work	This really need to be addressed, however i thin there are too many big lobbyists. IF we have oil and gas we should do what norway does and have a sovereign fund.  Then you see idiots like the one to the left 'i love my diesel engine', you may well do, but people love there kids and their countries, more important
__label__Attack	I think we really should all use our vote, even if it's in a tactical way to remove a particular candidate or party. There's lots of information around to help - just make sure your sources are trustworthy	Local businesses need a boost
__label__Support	think those that are still unsure should vote lib dems personally, push tories further out	Views on Gaza and what's best for Scotland
__label__Support	Adaptation and fighting climate change often go hand in hand	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	look into all that gas cars require before you are so quick to promote them. 	While trying to sort. climate change, we cannot just shut the economy off, so yes we need cheap energy
__label__Attack	"Newspapers in general typically should not be open for comment sections , it is the opinion of that set newspaper. Also its easy to throw the word ""Algorithm"" around with not knowing the technology behind it."	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	What will take place tomorrow will be theatre. The problem is the system as a whole. The real power lies with the banks and financial institutions. Whichever party is in government they are subservant to these financial powers. We need a new financial system which is not a debt based fiat system.  	The same people voting for reform are the same kinds of people who voted BREXIT and ruined the country
__label__Attack	I feel the UK would not have much influence here - Israel would just ignore us.	University fees are too high, and you could argue that a large percentage of degrees offered today are not actually good value for money. Paying 50k for a media studies degree from the University of Bolton is not a good deal  
__label__Support	i agree repercussions should happen to the people who post hate comments	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__Support	That is a slightly fool hardy stance, not your points as they are sound, its the fact that any politician or party will actually do what they said they would when seeking power. Look at the NHS and Farage saga, he admitted it was all a lie for votes.	but conservatives have spend your taxes on scandals!
__label__Support	Seems a cost efficient way.	It can be done by using algorithms
__label__Support	Very clever Alison.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	agree. It is also well documented that it can be harmful. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.	Hate speech does more harm than good
__label__Attack	The disparity between London and outside of it it's crazy 	Labour surely can't be more untrustworthy than the tories have been!
__label__Attack	offending is not necessary	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	It can help improve efficiency and sustainability of production	Farmers need access to all forms of science and technology to improve sustainability
__label__Support	The United Nations have outlined what hate soeech is here, so this could be used overall as a rule of thumb... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	"The problem is hate speech needs to be clearly defined. There will be people that use ""hate speech"" as a means of having opinions they don't like removed."	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__Support	Comments should be allowed as they give readers a chance to express their feelings and mention the type of news that they enjoy reading	1st position: comments on newspaper articles should not be allowed
__label__Support	Listening helps understand underlying concerns	Active listening is crucial for building trust and reducing polarization
__label__Support	the tory government has destroyed this country with their selfish politics	Agreed. It must be ringfenced and protected like the triple lock on pensions with minimum guarantees 
__label__Support	I'm not sure I trust any of the party leaders to deal with any issues. They all promise so much but deliver little 	I know the conservatives have been awful over the last 14 years but it seems people have forgotten how much worse previous Labour governments have been 
__label__Attack	hate speech is a real problem and enabling it to freely exist on the internet can lead to a variety of issues including mental health problems for the person its directed at.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Removing comment spaces completely reduces social participation which is super imporrant for educating others.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Reform have no actionable plans whatsoever and are fuelled by fearmongering	I still have not made my mind up who to vote for as its always the same promises....
__label__Attack	While yes we should all be able to communicate freely, with the anonymity of the internet internet trolls go too easily unpunished and their actions not removed	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree - a much more coherent strategy is needed 	Coundn't agree more!
__label__Attack	It would reduce hate comments to the max.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I disagree! There could errors in implanting this to begin with and it may discourage them from using it, and therefore these products in general. I feel a dedicated team for tackling this matter or if a smaller company general overseers from time to time would be better and also hold a more human opinion on whether it is deemed hate or not.	Websites should invest in software to remove hate speech, this would allow for healthy debate without racist or descrimination.
__label__Attack	While it looks fair to request readers to create accounts and enter their personal details before being able to comment, the reality is, data breaches are still very common. Expecting newspapers to keep readers data secure might not be realistic when such large and technologically advanced companies as Optus can become victims of hackers. Consequences of having personal customer data stolen can be severe. https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/23/optus-data-breach-customers-yet-to-be-reimbursed-for-passport-replacements	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious  consiquences
__label__Attack	The main question is how to determine what is considered as discrimination or violence. Opposing arguments can be flagged as discrimination or violense.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	the algorithm could be abused by users	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	when regulating the comments someone will always disagree or challenge the rules. Claim free speech has gone mad etc.	comments should be allowed on newspaper articles so that people can have a discussion and express their opinions, regulation would ultimately ensure that everything is kept in order.
__label__Support	Yes this is a sensible solution to this problem	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__Support	"""Indeed, see what can be done locally before using more general national approaches"" (Steven Bee)"	yes people will become dumber because they will train their brains power less 
__label__Attack	I have to agree with DamianC above, I notice a lot of hate speech on twitter for example and I feel this would if anything create more problems as they would have zero control over the platform.	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__Attack	In some ways I disagree, as renters have a right to earn money during the increased housing costs, but also I do agree that kicking people out when they decide to up the prices is horrific. It should be that an agreed price is arranged and the government do something to make sure that the need for increased rent is limited. 	It could increase democratic legitimacy of the Commission
__label__Attack	no opportunity to discuss topics	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	also most newspapers stories are also posted online and out there forever on the internet.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__Attack	100% agree, Comment section is for everyone to present their opinion at all times	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	I think it is the responsibility of the websites to moderate any hatefull comments. You can agree and disagree with somthing without hate.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	The state should buy land and built social housing instead of leaving it to the free market. 	i totally agree, they have been so corrupt
__label__Support	Makes a more friendly and respectful environment	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice. 
__label__Attack	I think it is important for newspapers to provide a platform for people to express and discuss their opinions. Being able to hear other peoples' opinions is an important part of educating oneself, so completely eliminating a comment section seems unprogressive.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	"I agree with this. I would extend it to the ""new religions"" too (such as gender ideology)."	i do not believe that any incoming governemnt will change too much, as I have already said, honesty is no longer an issue, just tell people wha they want to hear, and do the complete opposite 
__label__Support	I agree. In most cases people often react out of anger or disappointment, sometimes even without fully comprehending what is being said which I feel is the reason for some hate speech.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	Yep. First step is to get rid of the Tories.	I am sad to say that, following the information on the media, politicians seem to be less than 100% reliable.
__label__Attack	will not work at all the dynamics of the comments section are very polarised	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	In theory, I really like this idea and feel it could minimise bullying and hate speech online.	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__Support	I agree, everyone has the right to their opinion and to express it	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Human-based detection exists for certain content, but represents a really high cost for companies.

Yeah they promise different things , but when they have the power they'll do absolutely nothing. 	Pensions, Immigraation, the NHS, 
__label__Attack	there is no guarantee that other platforms will not also have hate speech, if anything they might even encourage it more as they may attract a particular group of people who are interested in spreading hate speech	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	this literally achieves nothing	"A pop-up can be used which reads ""if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments""."
__label__Attack	I disagree, people know the damage but do not care.  They hide behind relative anonymity and so do not worry about what people think of their posts.  Like many things, you can educate as much as you want but if people choose not to listen it will make no difference	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	good idea but you nead the right person with a good moral compass on board,to give a level playing field for all.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I partly agree, the issue with universities are that there are too many of them and many offer poor value courses with low quality of tuition. 	I agree that we need to rebuild our relationship with EU and vastly increase housebuilding. I think rejoining EU won't happen but realistically the single market instead (as much as I would wish we were still part of EU) 
__label__Support	Well said, its been here this long, I think its safe to assume it will stay that way for a long time.	Placing blame and/or trying to figure out who's at fault is pointless. It doesn't matter if it's the corporations, individuals, or natural processes--the problem exists, whatever the cause. And it has to be addressed, even if it's expensive, even if it's monumental, even if it seems impossible to solve--because without working toward a solution, our planet and ourselves will cease to exist.
__label__Support	Agree, this problem needs to be sorted, it can not violate human rights	I am not sure if what i am typing is being recorded....
__label__Support	I agree, the comment section should likely remain but be heavily moderated and regulated to disallow hate speech as the article above says	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Very true! Once a party is elected half the promises go out the window! 	Agree and they have nothing to show for it
__label__Attack	"In my country, and I have no doubt in many others, incitement to hatred is punishable by law. So, when you write that it is not the problem of newspapers or websites, I can only be astonished. It is too easy to start a controversy that may have consequences and to defend it by saying: ""we have started a discussion, the outcome is not our responsibility, we wash our hands of it""."	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	What do you consider the feedback loops, first we have to list them. 	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	This sounds like a very expensive solution - I think maybe more time and money should be spent on algorithms that can do the same thing	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__Attack	While I agree, there are many ways in which these auto-moderation technologies can be bypassed. https://newmediaservices.com.au/9-ways-to-bypass-auto-moderation/	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__Support	It's a good idea to reduce anonymity so more people can be linked to the things they say and rightly may think twice about coming across as a hateful person.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__Attack	I also think these should be monitored to a certain degree because hurtful comments can't be out there like they are currently	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	We need some approaches to actually preventing hate speech and putting an end to it.	Hate speech will always appear on open forums.  The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__Attack	Some people with genuine or kind comments may be put off interacting	I agree with FransescoT online forums can be a wonderful community but hate speech with faceless people can ruin it. If you want to comment there should be some accountability.
__label__Attack	The NHS is a bottomless pit. However much money you put in it will be spent and more required.	Agree no such thing as illegal immigration
__label__Support	The NHS has been deliberately led to fail in order to fastrack it's privatisation. 	Hardly the most important issue just now
__label__Support	Report comment buttons would make that comment flagged up to moderators and therfore removed quickly	report comment buttons could be useful but there should be monitors that check comments before they are allowed to be posted
__label__Attack	At the same time, people have a right to comment and discuss - the more we engage with difficult topics and debate, the more we practice our critical thinking, and I think we owe the average commenter more credit than thinking they can't differentiate between opinion and fact.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__Support	we need to understand that freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of hatred	Agreed
__label__Support	I agree. So many crimes/acts of violence in the real world have begun as online comments. It is certainly an important topic to discuss and find the right solutio n for.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	agree as it can sometimes be very harmful	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	No as not everyone may rely on AI	Sharing how we all have learning from failure is very refreshing
__label__Attack	Privacy concern.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Yes I'm sure there is software that can do that.	Censor out words
__label__Attack	there is a difference between hate speech and an opposite view	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion
__label__Support	hope they don't fix the ballot and its noticed that more and more people are deciding none of the options are what we want 	They can't be handled any worse than how they are currently handled though.
__label__Attack	This is not in line with our right to freedom of speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion 	it should target the insulting and violation to individual and groups right by law or common morality  
__label__Attack	If newspaper columnists can publish their opinions, why can't the public enjoy the same freedoms?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	We should stay of it all - its horrible yes but focus on the UK 	Yes I agree this is absolutely huge, but we need to reposition it, not make it so doom-laden as it turns many people off. There are opportunities for green technology, get ahead of the energy transition etc. Small changes by lots of people make a difference.
__label__Attack	But how the the average person avoid these companies big expensive ideas when they are just about making ends meet now?	While trying to sort. climate change, we cannot just shut the economy off, so yes we need cheap energy
__label__Attack	This would require a special team to supervise the comment section at all times which might be costly.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree, both such important issues	More help for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder
__label__Support	I agree that we have to try. There is no quitting. 	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	"""Strategy and policy, guidance, controls, support"" (Crispin Edwards)"	Not exaclty, you can't talk in a way that hurts other people
__label__Support	Not a bad idea, give them all a shot at working together, instead of ripping each other apart 	The environment and immigration are just as important as the economy and the NHS. The latter two have more far reaching consequences than the first two in many respects 
__label__Support	I agree this would helpfilter some of the hate speech	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__Support	There is a lot of discord currently within the country, conservative have had time but a change is needed. 	100% agree
__label__Support	It is happening due to some natural causes too. Technology can't stop the natural course of things.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Support	But I don't see what they can do , in the short-term at least. The govt is screwed as it's built up billions of debt (and the BofE had to bail them out thanks to Kwarteng's budget).

__label__Support	Moderators who follow specific guidelines so that they are all consistent would be the best option to eleiminate bias	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Theyre all so similar in the end... no one really stands up for the people 	true that 
__label__Attack	You're trusting an algorithm that would need to be trained by humans - so the AI itself could still be biased.	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__Attack	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	By using moderators or AI to police the posts
__label__Support	I think brexit is the main cause of that	Bring back legal routes for immigrants with speedy processing of claims
__label__Attack	This may filter out individuals with valid opinions who just don't feel comfortable without commenting with a degree of anonymitiy	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__Attack	Requiring people to give a lot of information about themselves in order to give their opinion online is NOT a direction we should be going in. Moderators are fine; requiring people to dox themselves so they can be educated is not it.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	This is totally untrue.Freedom of speech will exist one way or another and newspapers shoul dbe promotign public views by regulated platforms, so they can be in touch with peoples real thinking and also allow othr people form their own opinions about current issues	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I agree with you about the level of crime and the economy and also the state of the environment. In some respects the economy could be linked to levels of crime as people are experiencing issues with day to day expenses and this could be inpacting the level of crime especially petty crime 	Some parties will say anything and can say anything as they have zero hope of getting in.  How some expect to fund any of their wild pledges is laughable. 
__label__Attack	I believe ALL websites with ANY content are responsible for the messages their content conveys - be it articles, podcasts, videos or comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	If we are to retain these properties in use then their cost of ownership/occupancy must be made comparable with alternative properties.  Options include ongoing financial support for operating costs, affordable upgrades to reduce operating cost.	Cost of upgrades, which are always higher for properties in a heritage setting, are unaffordable for individual owners in low wage, low property value areas. 
__label__Support	https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/ This is especially true because not all people speak the language! An algorithm would be best, but there are still some technical issues that we need to address.	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__Support	This is correct, as blocking free speech altogether leads us into a very different type of society. It is a tricky dilemma, how to allow free speech but prevent hate speech, but one that does need attention and ideas	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I don't think the best education policy will combat trolls, bad faith actors or targeted/well orchestrated hate campaigns.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	This is a great solution	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting
__label__Attack	https://www.salon.com/2018/11/17/why-comments-sections-must-die/ While this article seems to agree with this point of view, I still feel that taking away spaces for discussion isn't the way to control hate speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	although I do think that, however, we should consider how many people do in fact post hateful comments without the protection of anonymity. look at Facebook, for instance - it's absolutely full of hate speech from people posting under their names using accounts that people can view and learn more about them. perhaps if people are truly hateful then being known for this isn't a problem for them after all.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__Attack	I do believe that removing the comment section is the right thing to do. even though some may see it as restricting free speech	This is right.

__label__Support	Absolutely correct. The important thing is to identify what hate speech actually means, because what is offensive to one individual might not be to another.	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.

__label__Support	Yes I agree this is absolutely huge, but we need to reposition it, not make it so doom-laden as it turns many people off. There are opportunities for green technology, get ahead of the energy transition etc. Small changes by lots of people make a difference.	Cost of Living crisis
__label__Attack	yes i argree with this. it would not show that the newspaper is biased by leaving the positive comments only	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.
__label__Support	there wont be a planet earth if we dont act now	Other issues directly affect me, other countries pollute far more than ours does 
__label__Attack	yesss I agree	But too much freedom creates all the hate and toxicity we see in today's media 
__label__Support	Good intentions in which way? Less tax, less foreigners? 	What???
__label__Support	its nice to live in a kind society	Counting on peoples's good behavior does not work. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/discussions/2020/04/13/community-rules/)

__label__Support	The only time I think it is good to eliminate comments, is if the target is harmed psychologically by it.  But I do think it could be policed in some way to offset this.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I think over the past few years the UK has become bit of a joke on the world stage. We need to build up our credibility again for sure! 	what they're aims are about climate change and Palestine
__label__Attack	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Attack	Crimes are often blamed on Gypsies in thge Uk but they are referred to wusing other terms. Eg people who tarmac your drive and other stereotyped roles	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
__label__Support	Yes, a big improvement they could make is reducing the extremely long waiting times that we currently have.	We're all drawn into this 'change your work' concept, but is anything going to change because I vote one or another party?
__label__Support	yes so that people can say their views	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I agree with this statement. When we didn't have any computers, people didn't have the luxury to comment instantly.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	It is good to see alternative points of view presented on the page via reader comments. I think this can help to reduce the echo chamber phenomenon, particularly when readers cannot 'like' a comment.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Good that you are taking this seriously 	My main concern with labour is that they can cross boundaries that the Tories then exploit when they get back in. Labour introduced tuition fees, Tories hiked them. I fear that something similar could happen with the NHS this time round.
__label__Attack	Having an algorithm do the work will inevitably lead to false positives and will also lead to culprits re-tooling their speech to skirt around the algorithm's 'rules'.	By having an algorithm that detects and  deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	the mods could be outweighed due to the content volume	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__Attack	The creation of specific platforms to discuss this information often leads to groups with similar beliefs setting up their own platforms, which become a haven for hate speech and fake news	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	We cannot invest trillions in an attempt to reverse climate change, without first knowing that is possible, manageable and achievable in a reasonable amount of time	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	do u really know the meaning of hate speeches?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	i think these ideas would be the way forward and i agree	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Moral and ethical values shape fair environmental and social change  	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down. 
__label__Support	more should be done to stop us wasting energy and water	poorly worded I admit, I meant how those who have immeasurable amounts of money are able to get away without taxation while the rest of us are so harshly punished 
__label__Support	Yes, I fully agree with this. Everyone should be allowed the opportunity to comment, however the comments should be monitored  because as much as everyone has the right to freedom of speech ,it  must not negatively affect the next person.	I think people should be encouraged to give personal comments however they need to be monitored to ensure hate speech cannot be seen which might negatively impact others
__label__Support	it glitched out so i didnt get to finish what i was typing, but clearly 14 years of the tories have run the country into the ground not to mention everything being sold off to foreign countries for a quick buck. tories would sell their own family to the saudis or qatar for a few quid	Yes this should be one of the top priorities  
__label__Support	all lacking. need to tax the mega corporations and reinvest in our NHS schools and housing	Corruption needs to be stamped out. This is a problem that applies to all political parties.
__label__Attack	In my opinion, yes, its normal to say what you are thinking as long as you dont harm anyone in any way sow yes silencing its needed.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	If such a thing can be created then it could work well	By having an algorithm that detects and  deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	Leadership at the OU also needs to model diversity and inclusion which it does not	yes, but we need to motivate  their continuous participation.
__label__Support	I agree, cancelling opinions is reducing free speech, but there needs to be a bar to which all comments are moderated and allowed/prohibited.	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__Support	True. I agree	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	How do you propose to address the root causes?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	14 years is long enough, especially when the situation, ie. immigration is getting worse 	needs funding and making more efficient
__label__Support	New ideas and thoughts emerge from the comments. New opinions.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Facts	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__Attack	why was the comment removed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	It would be nice if people could enjoy life aswell as working hard. 	Stop sending military support to Israel and work to stop the genocide is Gazza
__label__Support	Would make people think before posting	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__Attack	I mean sure voting for fascism is definitely a change but probably not the one that we should go for	definitely agree it seems as if it has been all about power for the last 14 years
__label__Support	Social media allows for international communication and connection	Social media and AI have positive impacts on society
__label__Support	yes people will become dumber because they will train their brains power less	People will become dumber. 
__label__Support	I feel we are going backwards with LGBTQIA+ rights and need to ensure this is not allowed to happen. 	make the ministerial code stronger with harsh penalties for breaking it
__label__Attack	I think that removing the comment section on specific topics is important	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__Attack	 The leadership styles of the two parties are markedly different. In my view, Keir Starmer has demonstrated significantly stronger leadership compared to Rishi Sunak. Starmer has shown a clear vision and decisiveness in addressing key issues. However, there is still room for improvement. Starmer could enhance his leadership by being more proactive in policy development and more transparent in his decision-making processes. Meanwhile, Sunak's leadership has lacked the same level of clarity and direction, which has been a disadvantage during these challenging times. Both leaders have the potential to grow, but currently, Starmer stands out as the more effective leader, albeit with areas where he can still improve.	Left-wing extremism has taken hold of many of our institutions, to the extent that many people no longer view it as such.
__label__Support	"I don't think ""ineffective"" is right word to use, I think 80% of the suggestions would somehow have an effect on this because it it a measure after all, it may not completely address or eliminate hate speech but it will have an effect."	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	"Free speech should trump hate speech because hate speech can also be interpreted as political speech where by dissent of the prevailing political and cultural agendas are not accepted or an attempt is made to use ""hate speech"" to create a stigma around political agendas that are unpopular."	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Agreed it needs to stop, but the first priority of a UK government should be to improve the lot of its own people. While I agree Israel/Gaza is a horror, our first priority has to be to improve the future for our own children, then focus our energies on helping the less fortunate. 	Totally agree, climate and people's welfare are the big ones 
__label__Support	Yes, people need to be more willing to kick up a stink 	How will you all be voting?
__label__Attack	But if people´s right to speek is crossing the border towards hatered speech then you are disregarding another´s right of respect	when we talk about filtering the critical aspect that usually arise is the fact what would be the criteria who gonna decide what is hate speech and what is canceling people's right to speak 
__label__Attack	Too many people might find it offensive and may be sensitive to the article and therefore take 'opinions' more personally.	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__Support	the rental market is insane and the lack of access to affordable secure housing is a major issue	I agree about the NHS. We are forever in a crisis and need a fresh outlook to see if anyone can do better
__label__Attack	it is not always possible to monitor every single post	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using  both AI and human intelligence
__label__Support	It would help address citizen frustration and disengagement	Regional normalization efforts could help the peace process
__label__Attack	Eliminating the comments section won't stop hate speech: we have to work on the root of the problem	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	comments can be moderated and removed	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__Support	The NHS and social care, together with the dire poverty in what is supposed to be a first-world country, are priority issues which should be dealt with immediately.

Cost of living is way too high, also re-privatise the Rail lines, Gas, electric, as these are run by greedy big companies

__label__Attack	It may lead to an underground subculture or racists, homophobes who avoid this format	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Agree and come to an agrrement of which part should be removed, or find a better way of writing it which does not have any hate speech in it	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.
__label__Attack	Moderator bias	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names.  Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__Support	An algortithm can provide a cheap and effective solution that is available 24/7 to moderate	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that this would help to improve young people's access to housing.  Might also help improve economic growth.	Trust in politics
__label__Attack	When moderators have to approve all comments before they get posted you might create an environment where comments the moderator does not agree with do not get posted at all. The better option in my opinion would the second one where you allow readers to flag inappropriate comments, together with a moderator team reviewing these comments.

__label__Attack	Good idea, however the elimination of hateful words won't completely eliminate hate speech altogether (ex. people can use alternate language)	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__Attack	Its not a easy thing to inconvenience people more than they already are.	This conversation seems to be pointless as our opinions will probably never be heard by those who are in control and authority and by big government who controls the people.

__label__Support	"""Change does not necessarily equal harm, we need more discussion of no harm. "" (Crispin Edwards)"	Weapons automatization 
__label__Support	yes, hate speech criteria should be overlooked and set by a credible outside source.	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__Attack	You give for granted that the automatic is half stupid and the human is a well intentioned agent	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding.

__label__Support	so moderators and filters are needed	We need to let people have their opinions spoken. Removing the comment space is not a good option. Instead, we need to better educate people on what's good and what's bad.
__label__Support	Agree, public sector has been destroyed by this government.	we  better leaders who can actually do the job
__label__Support	Totally agree. People need to be held accountable for their actions. It sets a standard and builds trust	this is my greatest reason for voting this yr 
__label__Support	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	why not?	The NHS needs sorting out
__label__Support	Totally agree!	Reform are a party made up of racists and bigots, they have no actionable plans that would actually work
__label__Support	I agree as there is a lot of content online that is false or relies on small data that is not reliable.

__label__Support	Agree entirely, but answers to questions like this come there none when politicians are talking about their policies on housing - it's all about numbers of houses and very little about who they are for and how the likes of young people can realistically get on the housing ladder.	For me one of the key things has been housing, the economy, migration and culture
__label__Attack	All the environment benefits can be achieved just by a vegetarian diet, you don't have to go fully vegan 	I believe thats an accurate solution 
__label__Attack	Some people could cloud hate speech as 'open mindedness' and use it as a way to push their agenda without taking responsibility.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	agree, reduce waiting times especially for A&E 	why not?
__label__Support	i agree, there should be monitors to stop this practise	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime

__label__Support	That is true. Every country should take  adequate measures in preserving nature and environment.	While trying to sort. climate change, we cannot just shut the economy off, so yes we need cheap energy
__label__Attack	Disagree. I think that newspapers have always been allowed to 'sell' information, but news sites do so at their own risk by eliminating vast swaths of subscribers and advertisers. A good reliable newspaper is also the best long term business model	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	Somewhat agree with this statement. The marginalised are oftentimes the focus of hate.	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__Support	Inequality yes- but regarding what exactly?	I worked in education for over 20 years so that is always a major issue for me. Education is devolved in Scotland so my views would reflect that. Aside from this, I'm a couple of years away from getting the state pension. While I welcome the triple lock, I hate that so many more pensioners are being dragged into payong taxes. Lastly, my daughter still lives with us but is saving hard for a deposit so that's important for me too.
__label__Attack	I think it is interesting to read the comments on a newspaper article, as the article is written from one perspective, while the comments show a much wider view. Even if I disagree with them, it is interesting and thought provoking to read the alternative view. Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience.  https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/

__label__Attack	brexit was voted democratically by a majority people need to deal with it if they disagree if you start ignoring democracy the country will fail sorry to tell you but democracy is important and just cause you disagree doesnt mean we should undo something voted democratically i agree others may have different opinions but it comes off a bit of a sore loser if you strt whining about your vote losing yeah i know it sucks but is a part of live honestly 	Totally agree, although I think there's a problem with the conduct of many people in public life. I'd like to see far stricter standards for MP behaviour enforced. Although it may be like marking their own homework...
__label__Support	This may cost a company, but will also create jobs in our current stressful climate.	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__Attack	would prevent hate	The comment section must be cut off
__label__Support	I agree with this position; however, I feel that another obstacle is also from the political willingness on a global scale to change dynamics of food chain systems	Neither of the main parties have given us reason to trust them, and even if smaller parties can be more scrupulous there's no point voting for them in a GE. It's all very frustrating. 
__label__Attack	You should vote for yourself 	the same study showed the conservatives would have to put taxes up more
__label__Support	People  are waiting too long to see consultants and operations are being cancelled at last minute. 	Hardly the most important issue just now
__label__Support	this would allow people to express their views freely and in a safe and monitored way	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__Support	I think moderation is better than asking for a lot of  personal data.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Agree and we should not give a platform for this.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	It will create faster moderation of content	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__Attack	This would completely eliminate everyone elses' chance for discussion	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	This puts the power in many people's hands	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It's pointless trying to stop people having opinions on the news. If no space to comment is provided people will simply go to other forums to express their views. These communities could be more insular and less moderated, leading to polarisation of views and ultimately breeding extremism.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	yes definately, removal of the section is an infringement rather find a way to navigate around sensitive or hate speech comments. maybe burn subscription of that particular individual	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	well said, this would help the economy a lot 	Yes I feel there are all these grand promises but very little info on how they will be funded 
__label__Support	Agreed! The current funding model for universities is dreadful!	Education, pensions, the triple lock and pensioners being taxed, along with the housing chaos are important points for me.
__label__Attack	Hunting people down for their opinions is too much like big brother/censorship!	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Yes I agree, but guidance on acceptability and respect is often needed	should be open to all
__label__Attack	Moderators have their own biases and blind spots who would be picking the moderators?	Just pay moderators
__label__Attack	how will that work?	Digital platforms can create echo chambers and polarization
__label__Support	Reduces hate speech	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__Support	pro 1	Adaptation and fighting climate change often go hand in hand
__label__Support	Elimination is not a solution, education and deliberation is	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	human rights of the masses should not be violated regardless of their beliefs and views
__label__Attack	would authors be held to account still?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	People are using hate speech in non sensitive articles too.	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__Support	Gathering data in a specific area of online discussion like newspaper comment sections would probably reveal a lot about how online discourse turns to hate speech and how to tackle it as a problem. Maybe this task could be given to an independent or charitable institution, with the newspapers' cooperation?	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Attack	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	how can you say this after the state the country is in	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!
__label__Attack	However a view point can be expressed appropriately as a constructive criticism by the target audience. Therefore you could argue that anyone who engages in hate speech is the wrong audience.	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__Attack	I think these people will then keep living in their own bubble and will never learn that their philosophy isn't normal.	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__Support	Agreed, seeing the numbers of people sleeping in corridors on a recent trip to A&E is shocking	I agree this is a pressing problem that hasn't received much coverage by the main parties
__label__Attack	Parties may resist internal reforms	Strengthen internal democracy within political parties
__label__Attack	Obviously there will be bias from the moderators as well, so this too will need to be kept in mind.	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely.  I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__Support	As a Scot, I can't agree. Labour is a perfectly good alternative (unless independence is your thing)> One great benefit of voting SNP would be rejoining the EU, though (although Indy is too high a price to pay). 	Immigration has gotten out of hand as has the cost of living 
__label__Attack	Removal of hate speech is not too much power, but hate speech needs to be clearly defined and a set of rules adhered to.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Yes indeed - crime - tax avoidance by big corporation and alot of other issues face us at the moment	Is there anything else in this survey? 
__label__Support	I don't agree, actually 	seems to me to describe management as much as leadership and too generic and not HE specific.......
__label__Attack	This works in terms of removing literal slurs from the platform, but doesn't account for when hate speech is more well-disguised or nebulous - how could we expect an automatic system to understand a dogwhistle?	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__Attack	I was quite happy when they were saying Rishi might fall in his constituency as that would be the ultimate put down for a sitting PM but sadly, they're now saying he might just hang on. I'd take your pick for sure!	Has to be the number one issue
__label__Support	new party need to be in power	I am sad to say that, following the information on the media, politicians seem to be less than 100% reliable.
__label__Support	This is true which is why I also suggested introducing a reporting feature so that, in cases where hate speech may not automatically be detected, people would still be able to raise a concern about the comment.	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__Attack	I feel that in this case, by getting rid of hate speech, I feel that it is worth sacrificing a part of free speech in order to make everyone feel comfortable.	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__Attack	problem is, it's not children doing it, its people past general education and often adverse to adult learning full stop	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	too many racists in the country  	Our NHS is on it's knees due to the lack of immigrants.
__label__Attack	It s unclear how to handle mutually exclusive or polarized opinions	The EU should continue providing financial support to Palestinian institutions
__label__Support	the link provides usefull ways for people to deal with hate speech	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.
__label__Support	covering both sides is great but we should be able to be respectful towards eachother	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	 I think that the human capital to employe human vetting would not be sufficient in a first filtering phase	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are! 
__label__Support	There needs to be an entire rethink about how it's funded. The NHS is a ticking time bomb in terms of funding. Either taxes are drastically going to go up for people in work/other forms of tax or it needs to be partly paid for at point of use. It's political suicide for whoever crosses that bridge. 	it really is for the vast number of people struggling. 
__label__Support	Certain words can be detected by the program which are hate speech and removed	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__Attack	Hardly the most important issue just now	Corruption
__label__Attack	sure what?	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__Support	All very important issues to consider when thinking about how to vote! I'm voting Green (probably) because of this, or potentially biting my tongue and voting Labour 	the fear of a labour landslide
__label__Support	The mention of collaborative efforts underscores the importance of multi-stakeholder involvement, which is crucial for effective solutions.	Neither of the main parties have given us reason to trust them, and even if smaller parties can be more scrupulous there's no point voting for them in a GE. It's all very frustrating. 
__label__Attack	Already we are ruin the nature to observe the CO2 and other gases.Now we are expecting the solution in technology side.It is not fully solution for change the climate.So we want to focus the nature resources management.	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Support	Good idea, never going to happen though!	Digital platforms can create echo chambers and polarization
__label__Attack	"You'd have to get everyone to agree on a definition for cyber bullying before creating the software. Computers only know what you tell them, they aren't sentient beings capable of moral distinction. The human programming the software defines the meaning of hate speech, this really ties into the book ""Noise"" which discusses variables and the way it can drastically change outcomes based on the individual handling things. What is their life experience, have they experienced bullying, have they gotten therapy etc. If it's more than one person you have to collectively agree on shared experiences that culminate to the final definition  of bullying."	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__Support	I agree, everybody has freedom of speech and we all have to right to access t information.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Helps prevent mental illnesses via online platforms.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	A moderating team might work but it could also be hard to revise every comment, specially is the newspaper is popular	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__Attack	giving those you always provide hate speech anonymously gives them the upper hand with gettong away with it. It makes it easier for them to do it over and over again	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__Support	moderators	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	The problem is can an algorithm actually make the full determination of what is hateful and not? It may have the same biases.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	People are on waiting lists for too long 	none of them seem to be honest  
__label__Support	Because people are flawed and invested in themselves first, it is hard to get cooperation from all sides to do something about a polarizing thing like climate.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Support	a lot to digest there.  I think just having a Government who don't just make stuff up would be a good starting point! 	nationalise the water companies
__label__Attack	Why couldn't you directly comment on the newspaper? How is a different platform going to really help?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Support	We need to express ourselves as the public.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Support	All very good and valid points, i am in total agreement with PriceP. Very well put.	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__Attack	everyone should be entitled to free speech	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Attack	Hate speech is not the same  thing as criticism. Criticism should be respectful and objective.	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.

__label__Attack	I agree, this has been seen on platforms in the past. This article about an online horse game shows an example of a moderation team going a little 'mad with power', being more harsh when dealing with mentions of politics they personally disagree with (banning people who mention being LGBT but not banning those saying similar things which imply them to be straight) https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2020/3/21/horse-isle-3-war-crimes-and-lgbtq-visibility-a-case-study-in-how-not-to-approach-community-management	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	Disagreeing with someone doesn't mean that I want to fight them, it means we have opposing opinions, so I think it's totally possible to disagree in a subtle manner.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	On the other hand it also eliminates the chance of reflections or beneficial  interactions within the audience 	"It is hard to actually define the ""offensiveness"" of a statement. "
__label__Attack	People may feel as if they are being silenced.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	People can have constructive debates and confront serious issues without using hate speech. Filtering hate speech will not stop debates.	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.

__label__Attack	"I think it depends the level of ""hate speech"". This is very undefined and to subject it to the same level as a crime in ""the real world"" is a bit extreme. Otherwise I do agree moderation of what people say on social media is needed"	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__Attack	I think that once you go down the route of cancelling comments, you run the risk of an almost dictatorship position for the newspapers, to be able to say what they like with no comeback from anyone.

__label__Attack	Well then what is your proposition	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__Support	This could be a good approach. Education is important	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Attack	Who now gets to determine the criteria, and what is topping them from being bias?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But what can be done about it? Will anything be done even with a report button	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__Support	I think this is true and there is no need for spiteful comments to be made and ruin someone's day.	All the posts should be checked before being posted and verified by some sort of AI. Hate speech could affect a person's livelihood and mental state

In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Agreed - it's technically simple to ensure that any website that allows public comments, can be linked to verified accounts. The government were thinking about doing this with adult sites - why not with sites that revel in hate speech.	We need people to supply their personal details in order to limit hate speech
__label__Attack	It is not possible for some people to ignore hate speech, and the effects can be extremely harmful - for example: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	i agree with this. although i believe that freedom of speech and hate speech do not have a visible line. thus someone may be hiding behind the guise of freedom of speech but spewing hate rhetoric.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree , however strong moderation to the comments very quickly could work.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	Will allow anyone to have a comment where necessary	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__Attack	Even with proactive communication, some stakeholders may still feel their concerns are not fully addressed	We need to proactively communicate and address public concerns early
__label__Support	Strongly agree, people who are expressing their fear of censorship should consider the risks that hate speech create for groups of people. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__Attack	Free speech should only be allowed if it doesn't infringe someone else's right, like hate speech does.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I agree that if governments are not willing to inform the public and stop manipulating us by placing chemical in the air for solar engineering than how do they expect individuals to comply	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	Personally I always used to vote Conservative but I will never ever forgive them for Brexit	Agreed - in some situations, people choose not to work as they would be financially worse off. That needs changing.
__label__Attack	I disagree, I think there is no difference on both platforms.	Comment sections are meant for social media platforms. The newspaper can post on a platform such as twitter in order to get comments - while disabling comments on their own platform.
__label__Attack	Some hate speech might actually be illegal, it should not be kept (https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime)	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.

__label__Support	hate speech i s not related to freedom of speech	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	We don't have the resources to do this. It is completely unreasonable.	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Attack	Not all opinions are valid. Some people should keep their hateful opinions to themselves. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__Attack	there can be nuanced discussion that will be lost if certain words or terms are automatically disallowed.

__label__Attack	I don't think that simply mitigating the problem should be our focus.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Support	Moderation of comments would appear to be the most practicle solution	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Who gets to decide what constitutes a 'controversial topic'? This is still a form of censorship and should not be allowed.	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.
__label__Attack	This sounds easy enough to implement however it begs the question as to why it has not been done already does it not?	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.

__label__Attack	I don't believe that Scottish independence should be a central issue in this election. There are numerous other pressing matters that demand our attention and resources, such as healthcare, the economy, and climate change. These issues affect the entire population and have a more immediate impact on people's daily lives. Additionally, the question of Scottish independence primarily concerns a specific segment of the electorate, and focusing on it could divert attention from more urgent national concerns. It's essential that we prioritize addressing the broader challenges facing the country as a whole.	nhs waiting lists, cost of living, palestine, education
__label__Attack	This could hurt many people who will be affected by negative comments	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.

__label__Support	Hate speach and racism could be dealt with and in time persecuted	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__Attack	I think this intrudes on free speech and is a danger to moderating certain things the newspaper might not want to be affiliated with.	Maybe if the comments were better moderated then this would reduce the amount of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Genuine hate speech will be ignored with that view	"some people ""troll"" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion.

__label__Attack	Hate speech can unfortunetely bean opinion base within this modern world. Being oversentativie to certain comments can pottentially reduce freedom of speech.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	"Definately agree, this must change massively.  Earnings, even above national minimum wage are just not giving people enough to enable them to have extra, beyond bills and food costs.

__label__Support	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	There needs to be a fine balance between freedom of expression and stopping hate speech. The best way is for comments to be screened as that would still allow opinions to be shared while ensuring the safety of all readers
__label__Support	Absolutely right, we are in the hands of corporate business man. But we can change this situation by changing our lifestlyes.	yesss I agree
__label__Attack	In principle a great idea, in practice this requires more money be spent on moderators and system updates	Moderate the comments sections!

__label__Attack	one-tone approach	As much as it might seem an attempt to constrict expression of thought, I agree comments should no longer be allowed. It always turns into argument and insult. We already know that for every opinion someone else will take the opposite view. A newspaper's view is its own, so let's keep it that way - we already know which way they lean politically. Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.
__label__Attack	Moderation can be timely and expensive and then you wouldn't see comments in real time	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted  to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__Attack	We already struggle to prosecute rapists what makes you think cyber bullying takes priority?	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech

Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	This is very sensible.	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__Attack	Completely correct, effective moderation is the answer.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__Support	Must tax the richer for sure. 	"We need people in the NHS who know about the NHS not so called ""managers"" who know nothing about how the NHS works. Professionals like Drs, nurses, physios, pharmacists need to be running the NHS."

__label__Attack	This would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

Tax policies aim to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share.
__label__Attack	There are a lot of moral issues to consider when talking about things like population control. Issues like these have been in public policy for decades without a solution.	I feel that climate change is happening on some level, but question how much of it is due to a natural cycle and how much to human activity.    When it comes to stopping pollution and protecting the earth, I am on board.   Where I draw the line is using climate change as a platform to implement socialist policies and take excessive freedoms from people.

__label__Attack	This raises several questions: • Does exclusion matter? • Is investing time and resources in creating a genuinely inclusive environmental sector well spent and why? • How can this transition to an inclusive sector best be brought about?	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.

__label__Attack	It may not be elimination, but reduction is better than nothing!	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	It would be irresponsible for newspaper publications to not police comments as they are giving the platform for people to voice their opinions. Them turning a blind eye to hate speech could be mistaken as them endorsing or condoning those utterances. The following article serves to support my stance and should you wish maybe you can take a second to read though it. https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	Some people may turn bitter due to being told what they should and shouldn't do.	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__Attack	Some opinions may be trigger ing to others	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	This is a great approach that requires public funding too, to avoid wrong retro-fit choices to be made in heritage sites. 	because yes

__label__Attack	Issue with time and who gets priority for arguments	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Attack	Labour will change the UK into Venezuela	I don't think any of them know what to do anymore, they all just make empty promises. 
__label__Support	Newspapers should remember they is freedom of speech	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice. 
__label__Support	I agree that AI moderators offer an ideal solution. I think it's worth considering that having human moderators would mean that there are individuals who have to read through hate speech regularly. This research article provides more detail on this point: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/09/220916112424.htm	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__Attack	Free speech is very important, but newspapers also has a responsibilty to ensure hate speech is not spread through their comment section.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	I dissagree, it should be a safe space for everyone.. people have a right to disagree but not use inflammatory hate speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Not exaclty, you can't talk in a way that hurts other people	Leadership in the OU should allow everyone to demonstrate leadership capabilities - it is not about hierarchical positions, anyone can be a leader
__label__Support	Implementing these can have a favourable outcome.	"In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check ""users"" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help"
__label__Attack	we have alternate way to think this problem. human population control is may be possible one way. but other way we have to follow and find alternate solution for this climate change problems like find reusable energy sources and green sources. mainly control co2 pollution through vehicles.

__label__Attack	Comment sections have become so ingrained in the news website experience that their removal will at first seem almost an affront to free speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I also don't think the removal of a comments section will make them take further, alternative action.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I agree. The BBC has previously been reprimanded for only having one side of the climate change debate speak (denier vs scientist).

__label__Support	I think that is a good way to go as it means posts can be checked before they are posted online so any posts that contain hate speech can be filtered out, whilst some may argue this goes against free speech and the right to free speech, I think when it comes to hate speech this is justified.	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__Support	This is silly, AI is always built with the bias of its creators	Develop AI which is able to detect and delete hate speech automatically.
__label__Support	Good idea. If it is clearly laid out what constitutes as hate speech then there can be no argument on whether or not a comment is deemed as such.	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial.  Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.

__label__Support	I agree that Comments should we posted then flagged by the public. If it has a certain number of flags it should then be reviewed.

__label__Support	The state of the health service is one of the biggest problems we have, and the NHS one of our biggest assets (despite the problems with its running).

The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Support	both my main priorities 	Massive improvement needed. Completely broken, Should be #1 priority
__label__Support	I agree, because not all comments will be hate speech, some are positive.	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__Attack	removing the comment section will drive traffic away and decrease the amount of time readers engage with the newspaper.	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree that comments should filtered	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post.  Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)
__label__Attack	On the other hand if platforms are held accountable, they may prefer to remove all comments sections, so as not to be punished  themselves.	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__Attack	We should all think before we comment freedom of speech does come with responsibilities	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	That fundamentally isn't the case. I really recommend that you read their manifestos and think more carefully about that	Yes, so many people living on the bread line.
__label__Attack	A website having the ability to gain enough personal information on you is dangerous. This is  dangerous for anybody whether their comment was hate speech or not. Hackers and third parties can gain access to that information.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Support	Having a timed ban is a good way to discourage hate speech, teaching people to reconsider their language and helping to moderate the tone of the comment section without permanently banning people from the discussion.	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution.

I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that.

__label__Attack	I think it demonstrates clearly how often AI struggles to detect hate speech or misclassifies innocent content as hateful - it would just further restrict freedom of speech.	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?
__label__Support	This is a good idea, as it eliminates the need for a moderator to sift through every single comment but rather they only need to look through comments that have triggered the bot. Then, they can make a decision on whether it has truly conveyed hate speech or whether (less likely scenario) there is human/bot error in the process	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__Attack	I have to disagree with this, as giving an opinion that is opposite to the other person's opinion is completely different that using hate speech to deliver the message. You can have free speech and hate speech banning at the same time working together. Using AI to spot hatespeech keywords, while still allowing people to argue and have different opinions, as long as they aren't doing it the wrong way.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	If the accurate information is given.

Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__Support	too many hate words	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful. We obviously can not control what people do but by filtering the comment section we can limit what people can and can not say.

__label__Attack	Surely it is possible to have a free exchange of ideas without resorting to hate speech. There must be a  level of basic human respect that can be maintained.	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	some people wont like being told what they can and cannot say	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.

__label__Support	I disagree but I still overall would do this	Government should impose some rules on the people to protect the environment . It may say every one must use electric vehicles, every home must have minimum no of trees grown to counteract the man made damage
__label__Attack	It will filter out how people truly feel which defeats the purpose of freedom of speech	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__Support	The root causes of the problem is not people commenting on newspapers, but how these ideas got into their minds. We need to work on education.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

__label__Attack	Arguably it could be in the newspaper's self-interest to police hate speech even if we say that it's not necessarily their responsibility, as moderation of comment sections has been shown to reduce perceptions of bias of the article itse lf (see e.g. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1356861)	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

Should we as a society allow people that say hateful things against a particular ethnic group, race or gender all in the concept of 'its free speech, you can say whatever' I think that people are able to practice their rights but as soon as it starts becoming oppressive or infringing on another person's right, that is where we should start drawing a line.

__label__Attack	Hate speech is dangerous because words have power and can influence others to act. It is the denial of acts of tolerance, inclusion, diversity and the very essence of human rights norms and principles.

Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments.

The only danger is if the moderator is also biased and does not like an opinion, but in these cases, an independent review will clearly show an abuse of moderator power.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	removing the comment space completely would allow people to focus solely on the content of the news and not allow people to provide their comments, this might give people the chance to be completely objective and just focus on what is in front of them instead of them using the comment space as a place to vent their frustrations.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Attack	I agree with Richard in so far as newspapers to this point mostly haven't had very successful moderating systems. Either they are unaware of current methods of spreading misinformation or they bring down the ban hammer so quickly that it makes their comments confusing	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not

Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__Support	yes free speech should be protected	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.

__label__Support	I agree with you. I am a member of some public facebook groups for various things and they all have volunteer moderators who immediately remove harmful content. This is definitely feasible, especially if they are paid positions.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I agree that limiting freedom of speech is not the solution. The algorithm should be able to pick up certain words/phrases that can then filter the hate speech.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Whilst I think that removing comments wouldn't fix hate speech, surely it would definitely diminish it and isn't that better than no solution at all?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I agree. And the majority of time people are not hateful or threatening. Those should be obvious enough to be simply removed/banned and everything else is fair game even if you dont like hearing it or dont agree its right/true etc	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I overall agree with this- communication is the key.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	You didn't discuss why they should not include a comments section. A comment sections allows the public to share their opinions on the subject matter and engage with one another pros and cons of the issue and see other points of view.	newspapers should not have a comments section.
__label__Attack	I agree the comment section is for everyone- but what else can we do. Evidence has shown that hate speech can lead to real life crimes, and that needs to be tackled.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	Yes this is a very important consideration in that we dont operate in a homogenous society. and culturally we are not the same, so what I consider harsh hate speech might just be considered banter to another group of society.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	Monitoring and moderating is not enough. It wont solve the problem.  Look at this study: https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm	But what about those who were going to give positive comments. I believe comments should just be monitored
__label__Support	that could also  be helpful	by not allowing certain words to be used in the comments space
__label__Support	Completely agree - there's a lot of evidence out there to support this https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech	Hate speech online absolutely must be eliminated and we should not encourage it within online platforms.

__label__Attack	This would be really hard to put into practice. I believe people should have the freedom to remain anonymous as long as they are respecful of others.	Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__Support	Major societal changes that will impact on all members of society are needed if we are to tackle climate change. Government, local councils, businesses, community and environmental organisations are all going to have to set targets and make difficult decisions. We need to ensure that there is active support for these changes from all parts of society.  	The first and simple advice often given by one of my colleagues is “thicker curtains across window and doors” . It’s short term and achievable for residents while other interventions are in planning (John Preston) 
__label__Support	I agree slightly, it is good to see what others think unfiltered.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Support	I just hope that if Labour win, that Green will get some seats to hold the government to account  	high on my list and my famili es lists 
__label__Support	I agrre with this	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is not at all the same as valid criticism.  And if freedon of speech is resulting in hate speech then I think it should indeed be policed and silenced	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	However, there are often ways to get around automatic moderation, and manually completed moderation would use a large amount of man hours and money	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__Support	What about peoples right to freely express themselves on platforms	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	"Your post contains the argument, ""Newspapers should cancel comment space because it can create... fake news."" I don't think this is particularly convincing. By that logic, newspapers and news websites themselves should be cancelled since they will periodically create ""fake news"" - sometimes not due to malice but rather by an honest mistake [or journalist incompetence/ignorance]. Ben Goldacre, for example, runs (ran?) a blog called, ""Bad Science"" and a recurring motif was journalists failing to accurately depict scientific insights. We could argue that their exagerrations and mistranslations could be construed as ""fake news"" but there's no malice involved. The journalists weren't trying to deceive anyone. The solution to getting closer to an approximation of truth is not to remove an entire avenue of communication, but rather to open up (regulated) communication in the hopes that the arguments that are most cogent rises above the rest - and that the logical wheat be separated from the illogical chaff.  That is to say, I think we need a better system than just, ""let's get rid of the comment section."" It's a tricky problem, no doubt, and a perfect solution may not exist. But we should not let ""perfect"" get in the way of, ""good enough."" In a subsequent post, I detail ONE possible method that incorporates several solutions previously mentioned (and as I write this post, I thought of ways to improve it further. Not perfect, but perhaps good enough)."	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	I agree with you, online privacy is already a massive issue, I don't want to have to submit even more personal data (that could end up sold to advertisers) just to comment on an article. I also don't think 'tracking down' people who post hate speech online is practical or achievable.

__label__Support	This is a great approach that requires public funding too, to avoid wrong retro-fit choices to be made in heritage sites.	Inconsistent application of planning policy and conservation guidance means that improvement proposals meet with widely different and unpredictable responses in addition to delays caused by the strained planning system. 
__label__Support	I agree, this gives people the option to learn from mistakes before handing them a more severe punishment and that would be banning them or removing their comments	There should be moderators of the discussion, people who use hate speech should be informed of what is problematic about their comments, comments should be deleted or they might be hidden but you can open them and read the moderators comments. If educating is not helping after first attempt, person should be restrcited form further discussion.
__label__Support	agree needs lots of focus	cost of living
__label__Attack	I believe those algorithms are not programmed to dealing with hate speech. Otherwise, social media would not be as toxic and emotionally as it is	As already demonstrated by other bigger social media companies, algorithms often contain and reinforce the negative biases of its creators, so I'm not sure how effective they would be in detecting and filtering out hate speech.
__label__Support	I agree it really is up to the publisher to include comments. I don't believe that not allowing a platform will reduce hate speech.	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.

__label__Attack	Do you believe that a newspaper comment section is an appropriate system for dialogue with someone spreading hateful messages?	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__Attack	The right to free speech doesn't mean there should be no consequences for hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Agree - all schools need to make pupils aware of views and faiths that might be different from their own. Greater awareness generates better understanding of others and harmony.	i do not believe that any incoming governemnt will change too much, as I have already said, honesty is no longer an issue, just tell people wha they want to hear, and do the complete opposite 
__label__Attack	The newspaper has the duty of educating and informing the public. One-sided articles should not be allowed as they fail to give a full perspective and may even spread misinformation, if there commenters are not allowed to correct or add a new perspective.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	i dont think being able to use hate speech, racist/homophobic language	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I find your view hateful.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites. A newspaper must responsibly manage its public platform, and giving platform to hate speech is a problem it can manage. A newspaper is, by definition, not a forum.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	Yes, another way to only limit hate speech is to remove anonymity. Therefore, certain sites can require those to sign-up with their bio and this is verified by moderators. Someone may think twice about being 'hateful' if there are repercussions.	newspaper might remove comment section as a way to prevent hate speech. however, it does remove freedom of speech to those who would like to express themselves through comment section.
__label__Support	This is a fair point -- maybe removing the influence of comment sections altogether will stop the trend of news increasingly becoming 'comment' and being less objective in reporting. If people want to exercise their free speech about the article's content, they can still share the article and express their opinions on it elsewhere, like on their personal social media channels.

__label__Support	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__Attack	Whilst this isn't a terrible idea for this issue if everyone in comments sections is discoverable this could be very dangerous and turn what is a purely online hate problem into a real hate problem. Many people online have talked about issues with stalkers and being doxxed and this could make the problem a lot worse.	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.

__label__Attack	Free speech should be entouraged but newspapers should have more responsibility to moderate	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance.

There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.
__label__Attack	Surely this would depend on the opinions and ideas of the moderators in some cases unless they followed some standards such as what the UN outline here on hate speech... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.

Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	I agree a screening process could be effective in filtering comments.	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?

It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of ""cognitive dissonance"" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context."

__label__Attack	Straight out of the WEF. No thanks.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I agree 100% with the support for Palestine and Sudan.  The NHS and Public sector has failed because of Brexit and Immigration cuts.   	Yes but this means they must build realistic and affordable housing for the average worker! 
__label__Attack	It could take a long time for them to be reviewed, leaving the conversation no longer relevant.	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__Support	It should really be up to newspapers, but better no comment section than an unmoderated one	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Definitely need to work on this 	I completely disagree with the notion of not voting as a form of protest, you can choose a strategic vote, where we align with a particular party's policies, just to balance out the representation, and allow some voice of reason to be able to speak-up
__label__Attack	In terms of the first one - I fully agree that those small boats are death traps. My main issue though with focusing on this when it comes to immigration is that it provides no context to the difference between asylum seekers (and actually providing safe routes for them) and illegal immigrants 	reform the media. MSM should not be owned by foreign nationals. Make disinformation in the media an offence
__label__Support	I dont even think the tories deserve to even be the opposition 	The government should be focusing on taxes to help improve the econamy
__label__Support	Yes there should be	There should be serious repercussions against hate speech
__label__Attack	Free speech is the cornerstone of democracy - it can be political but it doesn't have to be. Democracies should protect those that are vulnerable from abuse online whilst also preserving the spirit of free speech. If this balance can't be achieved then it is dictatorship / authoritarian territory.	Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Support	"Absolutely, vague definitions are the downfall of effective communication. A lot like ""Karen"" replacing the actual words for situations like racist, entitled, rude, emotionally volatile, unreasonable etc. When we all hold a different definition for a word because it's been used too broadly it becomes harder to communicate. Clearly defining what hate speech is with links to the definitions in every format is what could help. People consume information more effectively in different modes like audio, visual, written etc."	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.

__label__Support	Taking away hate speech may not allow the audience to actually continue to express any opinions at all	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Attack	Doubt it but they should, striking is the only bargaining power workers have and we have the right to it	Cost of living is a key concern for me, too. Both directly, and because it impacts on other areas such as negative perceptions of immigration
__label__Attack	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__Support	try living on an island in scotland it now over 30 pounds just to go and do your shopping	threat of higher taxes
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I agree but in reality, it is hard to carry out. It would require newspapers to work with law enforcement and there may be legal issues with the sharing of people's personal data. You also run the risk of this data being stolen or sold to groups or governments that should not be trusted with such data.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious  consiquences
__label__Attack	Everyone has a right to free speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I agree to remove it and that opinions should be on the third party sites.	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__Support	I agree, making it harder for hate speech to be posted through filters etc makes more sense than to remove a space where people can have genuine discussions.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Support	The newspaper should also boost positive messages of tolerance.	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__Support	Totally agree with this and hopefully most rational people would.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	More to it than that, but yes immigration definitely provides a lot of staff for our public services. Mismanagement is a big issue, hundreds of millions of pounds are wasted	Difficult to define and include truly dissenting opinions
__label__Attack	all criticism cannot be considered hate crime, sometimes it can be the harsh truth. How can we make sure these comments don't get deleted too.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Attack	Would this not limit freedom of speech then ? people wont truly speak their minds if its being filtered first. Moderators would be given too much power ?	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__Attack	As much as I would *like to* agree, I unfortunately cannot. Free speech still IS a part of free speech. I'm afraid you can't have one or the other - they are co-dependent as I believe, humans are inherently seeking conflict.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I think the comment space should be monitored by the newspaper for a more standard approach, because a lot of people have subjective views on what hate speech could be.	Newspaper websites can have an option where other people could report the hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	I believe that newspaper articles know the consequences of any article they put up and the kind of comments that may arise from such, it is therefor their responsibility to prevent such from occuring.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Support	AI is a great option that would reduce the need for manpower and increase the efficiency and speed in which hate speech is addressed.	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__Attack	I believe moderation should occur instead of total removal to allow people. to express their views	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	This can hinder the increase of hate speech by filtering out the hate words	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Support	Yes, the welfare of the masses must be well attended to.	Taxes, environment, healthcare, immigration
__label__Support	It's their arrogance that really gets to me. They have all these scandals, all these screwups, and then try to tell us that they're the only party that can handle the problems the country faces, many of which they're responsible for. They act like they're born to rule 	i think its the cost of living and making core costs affordable so public can manage
__label__Attack	They may edit out valid non hateful comments that are just not their views	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__Attack	some mistook freedom of speech for spreading the hate speech. Some root causes of hate speech originate from child hood traumas and are deep, i do not think that we may be able to tackle those just for the comment section hate speech.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I agree with Dominic , who becomes judge of what is true, what is without bias, what is hateful versus what is simply disagree, disapprove, dislike. Do we say happy things only and simply create artifical safe spaces where only positive ego boosting comments are allowed?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	Guidelines could be very useful to set up rules for what is and isn't allowed on the website. Then, everyone has a clear understanding of the moderator's goals and reasonings.	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.

She is married, able bodied and has a 9 year old daughter. Yet she choses to work one day a week as she has four horses and cannot look after them if she works full time.  Why does she get UC to fund her one day a week work with the DVSA? 
__label__Attack	Less people sign up for account	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__Support	more online platform needs a moderator role, too often you see posts on social media that have rampant hate speech going unfiltered and the commenter going unpunished	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__Attack	And how exactly is the government supposed to stop this? 	Probably not. Most elections are really a case of trying to pick the best of a bad bunch. 
__label__Attack	Humans have very little effect on what can be done to eradicate such a large problem. Yes every little bit helps, but how can the poor people afford to pay the extra for environmentally safe products, etc such as electric cars.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	This would surely reduce discussion. People should be free to contribute without having to give up their privacy.	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__Attack	Slow process. Subject to flaws if misinterpreted by moderators/other commenters.	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!

__label__Attack	You rely on readers actually flagging inappropriate comments and not just comments that they don't like	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Support	Agreed. Government needs to further regulate house purchasing by foreign speculative investors. There should be a hard-cap on the number of properties a person can purchase.	I agree climate change is a massive issue that needs urgent and significant action, I'm not sure the UK on it's own can have much impact though 
__label__Attack	That seems very authoritative and draconic.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Could you elaborate?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	I agree somewhat.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	I don't think this is the way forward - check out this article:https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-advances-to-better-detect-hate-speech/	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?

__label__Attack	A team of moderators would have their own bias so it is not possible to know what is really hate speech.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	How did you reach that conclusion? Regulation of comment sections has proven to be effective, as long as people are willing to help the platform by reporting these hate speeches so that it is properly dealt with.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Research and twenty one years experience suggests that there is little doubt that many people from different parts of civil society feel disconnected or excluded from environmental action and discussion at just the time when the environmental sector is working to develop and expand engagement. There is is a need on both sides to be heard, listened to and understood.	The first and simple advice often given by one of my colleagues is “thicker curtains across window and doors” . It’s short term and achievable for residents while other interventions are in planning (John Preston) 
__label__Support	True. At the end of the day, the publisher controls what is published	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__Attack	AI unfortunately does inherit the biases of it's creators and is by no means a perfect solution.	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/

__label__Support	The way to circumvent abuse of flagging is to create consequences for it. Being banned from the comments section in increments of time until someone is eventually permanently banned for too many infractions	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	Newspapers can't be one sided, they should give a balanced, fair point of view	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.
__label__Attack	Free speech has a limit, and there is no reason why people should be allowed to post hate speech online.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I do not believe that the people writing hate comments on newspaper posts would spend time doing this, therefore, i feel like it would be a bad approach	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.
__label__Support	agreed, the NHS is severely under funded 	Some of these issues are more pressing than others 
__label__Support	I like the idea of auto-moderation to automatically screen out comments with certain words that are considered hate speech	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__Support	totally agree and I think that this is the biggest issue for most people, the government has only cared about themselves and not anyone else	None of leaders fill me with confidence, none of them feel like strong leaders who could 'grab the bull by it horns'
__label__Attack	This article summarises it well	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	"Have you heard of the Scunthorpe problem? It is the fallacy of exactly this argument. If somebody wants to say something, they will find a way. Let's say ""tomato"" was a word that the algorithm blocked. An algorithm which isn't aggressive enough wouldn't block ""tom**o"" or ""2m8o"", etc. Even if these were blocked, users could decide on a euphemism which everybody means knows ""tomato"". Let's say they choose ""vine"". If the algorithm is too aggressive, then a friendly discussion on French vineyards would be impossible! See if you can see why it's called the Scunthorpe problem!"	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Human-based detection exists for certain content, but represents a really high cost for companies.

__label__Attack	Measurement alone does not address economic challenges for farmers	We need more transparency and measurement of sustainability in food systems
__label__Attack	How can we draw the fine line between hate speech and freedom of speech?	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__Support	I don't really think that any of the posts above really do touch the matter of this one so I can't really think of anything else to my argument here. (Evaluation as asked)	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally

__label__Attack	hate speech doesnt allways include certain hateful word so wont work in all cases	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__Support	I think that it should be the responsibility of the news outlets to ensure that comments are fair and accurate.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I absolutely agree. The first sentence sums it perfectly!	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__Support	No alternative views	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Support	It may prevent multiples accounts from one user	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search. 
__label__Attack	Media isn't about sparking debate it's about catching our attention, profiting off our attention and sharing their biased view with us. Some countries have tighter regulations for media than others as well, plus they write salacious headlines for sale knowing people won't always read the full text of the article. They cause the polarization in conversation.	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__Attack	People are entitled to freedom of speech and shouldn't have their views taken away from them	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__Attack	But humans are humans and some abuse these priveleges  by posting what they like without considering the consequences.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__Support	Yup. More people want more ties with EU now than ever, but a stranger to the UK would be hard pressed to know just by reading the manifestos. 	We need people in the UK to actually be helped back into work to realise they can earn more money by working than on benefits. There are enough people to make a difference without so many immigrants.
__label__Support	I am unconvinced by any potential leader	The NHS, The war in Gaza and the UKs response, affordable housing, safer routes for migrants
__label__Support	agree - adverts are on everything now so being on BBC wont make much difference.	Yes I don't know why they can't just tell the truth! It's not like the UK public expect them to to everything but what's the point in making promises to win the election and then not keeping to any of their promises?
__label__Attack	I love the idea of implementing a filter/moderator so the respectful opinions are still allowed to be shared!	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__Support	Allows space for other perspectives to be published.	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__Attack	Based on this article which i agree with, it is essential for humans to have the freedom to express their opinions. Free speech as given a voice to many groups of people to promote positive change.	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)

__label__Support	People should be allowed to give their opinions because where else will be able to read how people feel about certain things happening around other than comments. I just think they should be monitored and taught to not post hateful comments.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	The disadvantage of having free speech it causes people to think it is Ok to bully, lie or name call other people and this causes more chaos and leads to more hate which is not the path that most newspaper websites want.	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__Attack	Care must be taken not to accidentally block users	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__Attack	It is too dangerous to allow everyone and anyone to say exactly what they like, there has to be some rules in order to protect people.  It's a form of manners that we expect from each other in every day life, and should be no different just because we are online saying something.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Absolutely! With the current developments in technology we have enough tools to reduce hate speech without eliminating space for readers comments.	Registering with ID is the single step that would improve incidences of hate speech in comments section. That coupled with live moderation either by AI or human, and following rules that can quickly adapt to change should greatly rduce hate speech.
__label__Attack	It's true that hate speech is discriminatory and can constitute violence, but not all comments on news platforms are hate speech, and some are constructive. People should be allowed to share their authentic views on a subject, as long as those views do not discriminate against specific groups of people.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	yes. if their going to make money from individuals, they should also suffer the consequence of creating a safe space for them.	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say.

Neither of the main parties have given us reason to trust them, and even if smaller parties can be more scrupulous there's no point voting for them in a GE. It's all very frustrating. 
__label__Attack	Nobody should have to see it regardless.	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.

__label__Attack	Hate speech can be damaging.

__label__Attack	yes, the lack of consequences is the problem. We can see from somewhere like facebook where peoples info is so easy to find that people have had negative consequences over their hateful posts so clearly being able to link back the comment to the person can help	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!

__label__Support	I agree. It's also a good way to give a second chance to a person in order for them to change their behavior. And maybe help them understand that they are writing hateful thing, and educating them in a sense.	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.

__label__Support	I agree, as people need to be made aware that sometimes, what they say and think could offend other people.	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__Attack	How will it be worse than what is already happening?	Whilst I agree that maybe immigration is an all time high however what I dont agree is Rwanda deportations, there should be a better system in place (ie skill shortage which we currently have) or give people opportunities - what I dont agree is the abuse of a system. Im an immigrant myself (16 years moved here) and opportunities are betetr especially in a career im at (stem) and theres a massive shortage of it and if people want a better life this shouldnt be held against them

__label__Attack	Definitely polarised but can't imagine it ending well. You'll just turn it into a hate echo chamber.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Some parties will say anything and can say anything as they have zero hope of getting in.  How some expect to fund any of their wild pledges is laughable. 	its hard to concentrate on other important issues with finances so tight and bills and food unaffordable
__label__Support	agree. economy very important 	Immigration levels are high historically, but completely manageable if we learn how to actually build things in this country. We need immigration to run the health and social care systems, and this situation will only increase as the population ages.
__label__Support	it feels right	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__Attack	yes but we seem to be letting the worst of them who are not wanted in their home countries - most are comming for the money and not to try to integrate or make britain a better place	NHS, Housing Crisis, Cost of Living
__label__Support	If we try to make a serious attempt we can definitely reverse the harmful effects.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	agreed, the media hypes up levels of immigration. 	The NHS and social care, together with the dire poverty in what is supposed to be a first-world country, are priority issues which should be dealt with immediately. Climate change will take much longer to address, but we can make a start now - but cannot expect solutions within one parliamentary term.
__label__Attack	This is simplistic and would be very limited in its effectiveness.	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__Attack	Although the idea of having AI is quite a good one. How accurate will this AI be in detecting hate speech?	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__Attack	Free speech cannot just be cited at every occasions when the comments people make are criminal. Free speech is not an opportunity to break the law.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Labour haven't said anything in Scotland about stopping SNP? 	Immigration has gotten out of hand as has the cost of living 
__label__Support	I completely agree, everyone should have the chance to give an opinion and also agree or disagree with the points in an article, however there is no room for hate speech.  The best way to achieve an ability to comment on online newspaper articles and websites is to allow free speech but to regulate comments so as to avoid nasty hate speech, people then making such hateful comments could then be blocked from further comments.	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__Attack	Newspapers don't have an interest in this	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__Attack	A legal framework is needed to ensure  that media outlets don't censor speech on the basis that it is opposite to their views, with the justification that it was hate speech.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Attack	Moderation can be seen as restricting free speech.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

The leftist talking point last year was we have only 12 years left before we are all dead due to climate change. That is utter nonsense."

__label__Support	A very good point. So-called hate speech is often used by leftists to silence political opponents.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I don't necessarily disagree, but solutions would include funding the planning system better and requiring LPAs to have conservation advice, both of which would aid early engagement and head off the development of proposals that are likely to be refused.

__label__Attack	Surely these platforms could just end up filled with people who don't care about formulating a justified argument and post fake news instead. How do you monitor who is allowed to comment?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Support	I agree with this comment. I really would encourage people to educate other people about the consequences and reasons behind hate speech. These factors might contribute to reduce it	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Support	the problem is that people are not happy and that has a reason	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	monitored comment section	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Support	I agree with the main idea, but people who spew hate speech aren't exactly open to being educated.	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!

__label__Attack	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes.

__label__Support	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed? (In order to avoid publishers becoming reliant on retrospective fixing, rather than their initial checks - which are where the problem originates).	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__Support	Blimey, a chance? 14 years not a long enough chance?	Where is the money going to come from?  It is a mess!
__label__Attack	I have heard some users fear this. For instance, those who post anonymously about their sexuality or gender in countries where they may face issues in cases of hacking/user info being made public.	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__Attack	Would that be enough?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	Yes to the sex based rights - I can never vote for a party whose leader does not appear to know what a woman is	Is anybody disgusted with the restricted choice of parties we have to vote for..I personally don't really want to vote for any of these clowns
__label__Attack	This argument doesn't consider the ways in which certain kinds of speech can suppress other kinds of free speech.

If you don't like free speech then go live in China.
__label__Support	This would reduce hate speech and overall help to ensure a promote positive environment	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__Support	Yes I agree but I can't see which party is likely to address that - they all toe the fashionable line	totally understand your position, I also considered this (I've always voted) 
__label__Attack	there is a distinction between comments that are made directly in a discriminative way and comments that create a dialogue.	Key factors include ethical point of intervention along with just mere word filtering. Because sometime the message that was thought to be sent across might be pure but because of wrong choices of words, it can get filtered out. 
__label__Support	I would love to think that we could screen every comment written about every article but it is simply not realistic. Removing the platform that gives power to hate comments is the best solution. I understand that people want free speech, but i do not see this idea manifesting seamlessly	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__Attack	I disagree. This limits the freedom of speech of people and for people to be able to give their opinion and potentially challenge the thoughts of the newspaper. I agree that this should be done in a respectful way.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Privatisation has been a disaster for everyone except the shareholders. 	They have run this country into the ground in my opinion, cut police and NHS funding, crime rates have gone up, illegal immigration at an all time high, cost of living crisis. Why do you think they would be better for us than labour this time round? 
__label__Attack	I agree over-censorship is a negative, but there are laws about hate speech that should be upheld.	The is no need to moderate comments they must be dished out raw as they are writen by the readers
__label__Support	no one can afford to rent a flat or house on their own now 	Information alone is not enough without education on how to use it
__label__Support	Yes 100%	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__Attack	prevents people being upset,	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I totally agree. Freedom of speech is very important, but if it goes too far and it becomes online harassment, then it's time to treat it as a criminal offence.	"""Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the ""casualities"" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved."
__label__Support	I share the same opinion on that having a bot that can check for hate speech is the way either block users who use hate speech or put them on time out.	The comments could be checked for hateful speech. For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.
__label__Support	Agreed. Beholden to leaders based off the votes of another country, and then leaders of said country tell you you're not even allowed a democratic vote to leave said voluntary union. 	Better foresight could help prepare for crises
__label__Attack	Most readers don't know that comments are turned off https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	People are really struggling with rent prices 	i totally agree, they have been so corrupt
__label__Support	I agree that big business is only interested in the profits they can make and not at all interested in the citizens and their welfare	It is a lost cause, guys. I gave up long time ago
__label__Attack	The irony was nice, but for the debate it confuses more than clarifies ideas. So your opinion was a hate speech? If it was, should it be here? Otherwise, why it was removed?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	Training AI to do that would be a great way to prevent this phenomen	i think by just censoring specific words that are hateful/derogatory this could then automically screen out hateful comments that are abusive - i think it should be judged on what would be an offense to say in person. This could then use humans to read and monitor comment boards and then train AI to further do so
__label__Support	I agree with this. It's important for the newspaper to know how readers feel and react to the content	I have no real interest in reading readers comments sections in newspapers, but I don't agree that they should be eliminated. The content can be moderated to remove hate speech. This be done by a moderator, or these days, by AI.
__label__Support	Eliminating the space for comments entirely will mean that each article is viewed through the lens of the journalist. This is not completely impartial but it does mean that harmful speech or radicalised opinions aren't present to muddy the waters	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Attack	I personally think crossing out votes is better than simply not voting as it then is more of a statement about none of the parties being good enough to vote for and also counts in the statistics of all votes	The NHS needs sorting out
__label__Support	It can help address the complexity and long-term nature of food system challenges	We need to reimagine and redesign policy and decision support pathways for sustainable food systems
__label__Attack	Unfortunately there will always be some who will abuse this freedom	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Taxes are a good thing: how do you think we pay for things we all need, like the roads, transport, the NHS? 	something defnitely have to be done to the NHS, but further tay raises is not the answer. It's the whole system the issue. that no one doctor can make a decision, it has to go through on several different levels etc. and just makes so much longer
__label__Support	Yes, a slow and deliberate decline.	more should be done to stop us wasting energy and water
__label__Support	I agree that moderators are all too often bias one way or the other so only extreme hate speech should be censored.	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__Support	You make a good point - why do we need to give a platform for people to just say mean things hiding behind their computers when they wouldn't say that in real life.	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__Support	https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/06/role-education-address-root-causes-hate-speech-and-advance-inclusion-non	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Absolutely the main issues	Yes I agree this is absolutely huge, but we need to reposition it, not make it so doom-laden as it turns many people off. There are opportunities for green technology, get ahead of the energy transition etc. Small changes by lots of people make a difference.
__label__Attack	visit stop the tories to see who your tactical vote is 	Let's hope they win.
__label__Support	this can also be dealt with by having moderators who can filter fake news out/highlight the correct facts and refer to more up to date stories if relevant	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Attack	That would be very helpful	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__Support	I agree we can work to prevent it, but systems can be complicated to introduce or can be controversial in themselves	realistically hate speech cannot be eliminated but preventative measures cane be put in place to minimise its presence
__label__Attack	I like it but i worry it would just be ignored. Just removing a comment isn't much of a deterrent	"A pop-up can be used which reads ""if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments""."
__label__Support	good way to make a point	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	it would make sure that very offensive comments could be either moderated or removed	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__Attack	I think sharing ideas is ultimately beneficial and having a space to do this can help form stronger opinions. Hearing different sides of an argument and different perspectives help ensure that we are considering many views and not hyper focused on one narrative that may not be the reality of other people.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	I dont mind this but we cant ignore the fact that there are company who are spreading so much pollution and greenhouse effect just for profit. We need to reprimand them as well.	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Support	I absolutely agree that people need to have an outlet to share their opinion, whatever that is. And the only reason to really turn comments off is where someone is seeking information, and have their answer/are satisfied with the response; but on a news site, I feel like blocking comments is a cop out for a controversial story, or to protect the sources feelings rather than giving the public a right to have a say.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__Support	It is very difficult to police all the contributions	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__Support	Algorithums	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	"""Deserve a chance"" - are you trolling? They've had 14 years of a chance."	So many big problems to solve.  The place is in a state!
__label__Attack	most people dont bother to read more, they just look at the quick soundbites without thinking if they are fake or not	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	i believe that people know what is wrong and what is right. they do know when their comments are harmful	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	We're all drawn into this 'change your work' concept, but is anything going to change because I vote one or another party?	i am not sure if this is recording what i say

__label__Support	They should come with warning labels about how crap they are made of.	Inflation and housing prices need to be stopped. It's getting ridiculous
__label__Support	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation. United States. Social media platforms have broad latitude [PDF], each establishing its own standards for content and methods of enforcement. Their broad discretion stems from the Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law exempts tech platforms from liability for actionable speech by their users. Magazines and television networks, for example, can be sued for publishing defamatory information they know to be false; social media platforms cannot be found similarly liable for content they host.	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__Attack	terrible idea!! look how bad brexit was, power in numbers and scotland doesnt have the economy to survive and the SNP are as corrupt as any party	nhs waiting lists, cost of living, palestine, education
__label__Attack	"I partially disagree - perhaps 'aggressive' is too harsh a word for what I am trying to convey but newspapers have to take action here, and in some cases it needs to be very severe action. Example here with the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/04/21/comments-are-making-the-internet-worse-so-i-got-rid-of-them/, who say: ""Comments are making the internet worse. So we got rid of them."""	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	not focusing on the interconnection between free speech and hate crime	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__Support	I agree with this, as the issue of moderating newspaper comments also crosses the gap into social media where most newspapers will post their articles too.	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech

__label__Support	I support this, moderation should be visible.	More Admin and block buttons
__label__Support	Name and shame those that want to spout hate, I agree.	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__Support	Well thought argument. But most people are over 18 years old and are deliberate in spewing hate its unlikely that they will be re-educated if they have chosen to be bad apples	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Attack	But it also means that the newspaper will have full control over what is being posted and can filter certain opinions as well as hate speech to create a biased community look if they want to. Since they would never go on air, there would be no history of the page you can compare to.	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)
__label__Attack	I disagree that newspapers should be one-sided providers. Newspapers are often aligned to certain political parties, and that is not necessarily made clear! Readers may not realise they are reading biased news stories.   Comments should be allowed so that alternative points of view can also be aired.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Sometimes computer algorithms get things wrong	Use a BOT to regulate hateful comments

__label__Support	maybe get something to control what comes in and goes out	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I disagree. Democracy cannot progress if others are punished for the misdeeds of a few people. A headache simply will not be solved by cutting the head off. Other devices such as comment monitoring and elimination can prove useful.	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__Support	Would benefit society more in long term.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

__label__Attack	I do not agree that it should be allowed to be there at all.

__label__Attack	passing legislation on free speech is difficult especially in countries with entrenched codified constitutions	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online

__label__Attack	this is true opinion is important	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__Support	It can be fooled by the writing of the bad word, like in some social media.	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Support	Even a simple thing such as re-entering regulatory alignment with the EU would help with imports and exports# 	Investment into the construction sector.

__label__Support	it does indeed,  I doubt most MP's know what the word means	The thing is that parties like reform are very good at persuasive speech and knowing what to say but telling what their true beliefs are rather than what theyre saying jjust to make us like them is difficult!
__label__Attack	Will still allow some comments which could be seen as offensive	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__Attack	"I absolutely agree with that position. As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that. Also - hate speech is not illegal in most countries. Quote from Wikipedia: ""While ""hate speech"" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment."" Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States"	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	get rid of the admin staff who block change and improvements in systems and processes   they are the ones at fault  not the government 	Agreed. It must be ringfenced and protected like the triple lock on pensions with minimum guarantees 
__label__Attack	Whilst I agree that maybe immigration is an all time high however what I dont agree is Rwanda deportations, there should be a better system in place (ie skill shortage which we currently have) or give people opportunities - what I dont agree is the abuse of a system.

__label__Support	Simpler communication can help citizens better understand and engage with the EU	Measurement alone is not enough without action
__label__Support	but the amount of comments is what puts too much of a strain on moderators	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__Attack	Does not allow for positive feedback	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	It can limit hate comments	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Support	I agree with this too!! 	couldn't agree more that the party elected needs to be in touch with the average person 
__label__Support	Comments are still there for free speech.	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__Attack	being ban or warned has the first step	Again I think that removing comment sections entirely would overall be a negative thing. Yes, there are people who abuse the comments section and it they can use it to promote hate speech, but with the right tools this could be moderated. Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning
__label__Support	agree - need to reduce waiting lists	why not?

__label__Attack	In an ideal world perhaps, but how would you recognise 'hate speech' and police this in practical terms without infringing civil liberties and free speech. AI offers one avenue, but many challenges remain and there are many risks with this approach: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152	If eliminating readers comments is out of the question, then it must be that hate speech is recognized and removed before a comment is even published. People use the free speech argument but free speech isn't 100% guaranteed in cases of speech causing harm (e.g. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre). Hate speech causes harm.
__label__Attack	It's lack of investment in training. We can't keep letting our country poach other people's trained doctors and nurses to save money.	Difficult to define and include truly dissenting opinions
__label__Support	I completely agree with this and this might also allow journalist to engage with their readers. I found this study to be really interesting about how the majority of journalists that were interviewed found values in comments.	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__Attack	Reform are racist, bigoted, and have no real plans that are actionable	What will take place tomorrow will be theatre. The problem is the system as a whole.

__label__Attack	some people may have different ideas for regulation	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	It isn't perfect but it is a pretty decent %	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__Attack	I disagree - these policies must be mandated otherwise when they are voluntary (like in the UK now) people don't wear them - as a result infection rates remain high 	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	AI may also let hate speech slip through the cracks.	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/

__label__Support	when do we click next?	There is nothing wrong with immigration, but illegal immigration is simply that, illegal. It wouldn't happen in Australia, so why is our public bbeing treated this way.
__label__Attack	Im not sure what the poor has to do with it	I think that if we don't do something to start combatting climate change today, literally nothing will be there in the future to worry about - no economy left if there's no livable Earth left to inhabit. We're going to have to address this at some point, why not now? I'm not convinced that we can reverse what has already been done (ie, extinct species), but we can change the course of the future. 
__label__Attack	eliminating space for readers comments? is that the right approach?	WEBSITES BREACH FREEDOM OF SPEECH by eliminating space for readers comments
__label__Support	Yes, I agree, needs more funding and better rights for NHS workers including those that come from overseas	Also they all seem to spend all the time having a go at each other instead of telling us what we need to know about what they are going to do and how they are going to pay for it.
__label__Attack	Hates speech does not automatically equate to freedom of speech. In fact, often times it is a violation of many human rights. In that case it should be removes so as to protect the people that would otherwise be harmed by those hateful comments. Here is an article on the relationship between hate speech and freedom of expression. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	yes, reinvesting money inot services rather than into dividends and bonus payments. They should be not for profit public sector owned companies 	Proportional representation needs a Parliamentary Commission. No need to rush into anything
__label__Attack	If we do noting, we'll be all dead in 100 years	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year

__label__Support	Reduction in VAT on adaptive reuse projects down to 0% like new construction is offered is an obvious opportunity for legislation to bring about a circular approach (Katherine Gunderson)	AI can help us advance our technology 
__label__Support	Newspaper websites may remove comment areas if they wish. Having moderators or allowing only subscribed comments are also options that may work. They just have to be careful on who decides what is hate speech and what is fair comment.	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__Support	hate speech will be reduced	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__Attack	Crowdsource moderation is a great idea, similar to reddit where people can vote, but there are still moderators who can remove posts completely if they break sub rules	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	That will just give newspaper websites the opportunity to publish fake news without anyone challenging them (https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/journalism_fake_news_disinformation_print_friendly_0.pdf). for example, if they post fake news about covid, no one will challenge them and anyone who doesn't have enough information will believe what the article says.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Persons will have to think before responding.	By ticking a box to agree not to be abusive or hateful before being allowed to comment
__label__Support	Absolutely about holding the incumbent government to account for the last 14 years. The recent cabinets have gone far beyond just being bad politicians. They treated the public with utter contempt and have made life significantly worse. 	tactical voting to remove the conservatives, the decline of social services support from the government NHS, education, youth support, housing, cost of living crisis, transport, constant mis truths, people in power not being held accountable
__label__Support	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments deemed as inappropriate, perhaps with a limit of how many they can do, otherwise I can see some taking advantage of this feature and flagging every comment they disagree with.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	It doesn't matter whos in power, they all sing off the same hymn sheet 	I know the conservatives have been awful over the last 14 years but it seems people have forgotten how much worse previous Labour governments have been 
__label__Support	yes but it's not just about pouring money into the NHS. Surely it needs reform?	that is the problem we face majorly health care and education need to be rectify
__label__Support	We're simply not getting a fair return for all the different taxes taken from us.	cost of living
__label__Support	That is not a bad idea that I think might work with proper moderation.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	What do you mean by the boats? 	It could help address polarization by exposing people to different views
__label__Support	It is very very concerning how so many people seem to have developed short-term memory loss (for the last 5 years) when it comes to the shameful, insulting, disrespectful actions of those who are in-charge of our well-being as a nation	How can trans rights (bio men) be more important than bio females when talking about womens rights? birthing people? chest feeders? bonus hole? bloody ridiculous
__label__Attack	Hoping that they may publish is wishful thinking as well unless they have a system for it.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Attack	making individuals aware	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Agreed - we have a credibility issue on the world stage - too many political embarrassments back to back 	what they're aims are about climate change and Palestine
__label__Attack	5478e52cfdf99b5322cf7f7b The war in Gaza has very little to do with us. I support giving aid to Palestine and selling defensive weapons to Israel but what is the electorate of a country half way across the world meant to do to sway this conflict? 	Also a lot of waste
__label__Support	Totally agree with that, I can see Trump taking advantage	There are way bigger issues than this, the government are not able to do much with this unless they enforced rules such as no driving for all population. The best way to help environment is to recycle yourself 
__label__Support	My husband and I want to start a family and the thought of nursery costs and childcare is scary! We have no family nearby that would be able to watch them so it's looking likely that I'll be giving up work!  	Quality of life won't improve until the cost of living decreases.  
__label__Support	Free speech should never be curtailed.  But how due you suggest you address the root cause of the problem?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Right to free speech isn't necessarily a right to a platform or a publisher. Before the internet, people weren't entitled to have their comments on the news stapled inside a copy of the paper. They were just able to express their opinions on it independently, to family or coworkers, or by writing their own publication in response. I'm not sure if newspapers simply choosing not to publish readers' comments (which is what they are doing by hosting those comments on their site) is the same as censoring free speech. By this logic, anyone who writes a poorly written opinion piece and submits it to the New York Times should get it published, because otherwise their speech is oppressed.	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__Support	there should be notifications when someone is discussing with yr opinion LOL 	I am not sure if this will happen 
__label__Attack	We cannot adopt but we should adopt to it because there is no other go with the affected environment unless helping the environment  less pollution	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Automatic filtering technology can be improved continuously and I think it would reach an adequate level of censoring without limiting freedom of speech. Some social networks like Instagram already give an option for users to select if they want to see hate speech or not  
__label__Support	I like the idea of 'repeat offenders' being noticed if you will. It means people can't abuse the system as easily	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.
__label__Support	Agree, need a fairer distribution of resources. But are Labour bold enough to tackle this? 	"Focus on the NHS and genuine issues.  No need to hear anything about ""woke"" issues as they aren't important!  Focus on supporting families, reducing energy buills"
__label__Attack	I'm not convinced this is a helpful input in its own way.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	these are important issues to me	Yes, I agree that the rich really need taxing, the Greens have it right there
__label__Attack	it is their responsibility, albeit partially	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	People with genuine hateful intentions will not change because of this.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Support	testing with slide, somewhat agree	"BASEd ON: ""I think that would like to read in the newspaper that, all the elected at European level are young people with a majority of women."", Person36 "
__label__Support	Completely agree with what everyone has said about immigration needing to be reigned in 	The cost of living has got out of hand and the big companies are making big profits from us all.
__label__Attack	5478e52cfdf99b5322cf7f7b  Better a boring leader who carefully considers the options and outcomes  than the last few years of utter chaos.	There are way bigger issues than this, the government are not able to do much with this unless they enforced rules such as no driving for all population. The best way to help environment is to recycle yourself 
__label__Attack	I disagree - these policies must be mandated otherwise when they are voluntary (like in the UK now) people don't wear them - as a result infection rates remain high	I believe that mandatory mask-wearing policies infringe upon personal liberty, and that mask mandates are politicized and are manipulative tactics by certain politicians and special interest groups as ways to increase state control
__label__Support	I absolutely agree. It's newspapers responsibility that these comments do not end up in their comment section.	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	Technology can help. Planting trees can also help but isn't the single solution. We need to simultaneously adopt many strategies and methods to fight climate change.	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Support	not a bad idea	have an AI to scan and analyse trigger words, then the alert is passed to a human reviewer then can say whether or not it's hate speech
__label__Support	True and in my opinion the right to freedom of speech should trump any counter argument.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Yes, I agree and they seem to think that we all want tax reductions when I would ather the money was spent on helping the NHS, etc get back on its feet.	Student loans are another big issue. We are saddling our children with debt as Universities are entering a financial crisis of tgheir own
__label__Support	Definitely. The current system is a joke and the Easyjet flights to Rwanda will actually land just outside Bournemouth	You and me both, these are rights that we should have access to in our country (the sixth wealthiest in the world!) 
__label__Support	I agree that we need to rebuild our relationship with EU and vastly increase housebuilding. I think rejoining EU won't happen but realistically the single market instead (as much as I would wish we were still part of EU) 	I'd like a full focus on the NHS.  Help support our healthcare professionals.  Not really bothered about immigration.
__label__Attack	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__Attack	Breach of free speech	"Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech. ""Fight back against harmful messages in public places by publicly standing with victims in solidarity"" https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-onlin-hate-speech/"
__label__Support	Exactly, if not mandated there's also a strong negative social pressure effect where many people who are actually in favour of wearing masks don't dare to do so because of fear of being the social outlier or even treated aggressively.	I believe that mandatory mask-wearing policies infringe upon personal liberty, and that mask mandates are politicized and are manipulative tactics by certain politicians and special interest groups as ways to increase state control
__label__Support	"imagine if we'd said ""not our problem"" during WWII. What is going on is the world's problem "	Lots of politicians are a bit out of touch with actual reality
__label__Support	if we the individuals dont try then who are we to tell the chinese 	Other issues directly affect me, other countries pollute far more than ours does 
__label__Support	it is not going to be helped by the choice of candidates in the US	poorly worded I admit, I meant how those who have immeasurable amounts of money are able to get away without taxation while the rest of us are so harshly punished 
__label__Attack	You are aware that ethnic minorities can be racist?	Views on Gaza and what's best for Scotland
__label__Support	I have never supported one particular party, I only voted for who I think the best (or least worst!) person is each time	Those are key factors for me too but unfortunately the major parties have not really about them! 
__label__Support	Do you mean the shadow cabinet minsters as well? As they seem not to serve any purpose.	They have the clearest strategies of all the parties. Please read the manifestos!  
__label__Attack	Am sorry but what works for you does not work for all. 	an absolute hail mary to the baby boomers. It'll be 'Bring back the death penalty' next 
__label__Attack	However it should be note that the AI should not be programmed with inherant biases of the programmer(s)	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__Attack	this already exists on certain websites and you can still easily view hateful comments	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__Attack	Yes, you can have your own opinion but that doesnt mean you have the right to spread hate.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Higher food prices could negatively impact consumers	We need to ensure fair prices and income for farmers
__label__Attack	Newspapers are nationally available.As are there websites.Whilst newspapers cant be held responsible for the comments of its readers ,i do think they should have a moderater to delete harmfull posts that could offend.	Hate speech will always appear on open forums.  The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__Support	I feel something really needs to be done to help the NHS as well, it's supposed to be the pride of the nation	But first and foremost you have to agree with what theyre promising
__label__Support	While I agree that it is getting harder every year, we need to do something about it now. It's never going to be an easy process, but the sooner we start, the better. We need to make drastic changes now so that policy and consumer interaction can be at the level necessary to move things in the correct direction.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__Attack	What???	We need a better country for our children.
__label__Support	Yes there should be restrictions in the form of vetting comments before publishing it	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__Attack	I'm not sure if AI could function well enough at this time for this to be the final answer.	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__Attack	Who is to say what is or isn't 'harmful'? It sounds like you want to control a good chunk of the population who don't agree with you on things.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Attack	no it wont	living with covid will need much new investment in primary care
__label__Attack	I don't disagree that we have a problem with housing etc, but I don't feel comfortable with centering on overpopulation, as what does this mean for a solution... depopulation? And what does that lead to? That becomes an uncomfortable place	I worry for those that are less fortunate than I am 
__label__Attack	"As much as I agree with you that everyone should be able to express their own ideas. The internet is full of trolls who are constantly usung hate speech and without any guidelines or moderation. It's quite impossible for there not to be any ""aggressiveness."""	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	In the other hand, if we don't try to do something then we lost allready 	Exactly, if not mandated there's also a strong negative social pressure effect where many people who are actually in favour of wearing masks don't dare to do so because of fear of being the social outlier or even treated aggressively. 
__label__Attack	I think by promoting the hate speech it very much takes away the meaning of the subject. You dont need to be hateful to agree/disagree with something. You can be constructive in your approach and this will have a greater impact on the issue and cause for a logical debate between people. So an element of policing is required	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Essentially agree on all of these plus add the NHS and social care	making sure to vote to give conservatives a chance
__label__Support	It is true, there is freedom of speech, all readers should be able comment on what they think	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__Attack	Time consuming	Strict content moderation
__label__Support	yup. we're doomed. if you think the Tories are incompetent, wait until you see David Lammy and Angela Rayner trying to run things.	100% agree
__label__Attack	I disagree people need to show what they think about what has been written	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	I think some avenues are being made to increase LGBTQIA+ rights but perhaps not quick enough. Cost Of living has just got out of control and those costs aren't going to come down.  it will take a few years until peoples salaries catch up and prices have been stable for a while until the pinch lessens and I doubt any government will make a huge difference to this as their goal will be to keep inflation down. 	make the ministerial code stronger with harsh penalties for breaking it
__label__Attack	It would require more time and effort	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__Attack	Yes I agree many people are able to not get aggressive over a newspaper topic, however there are plenty that do, and allowing full expression of opinions without monitoring and consequences could lead to people being offended or bullied	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	cost of living in a big city will always be high no matter where you are in the world. Simple case fo supply and demand 	Every time I go to the supermarket, I feel like I'm spending more and more 
__label__Attack	anyone could have a problem with another persons point of view	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious 	it should target the insulting and violation to individual and groups right by law or common morality  
__label__Support	I agree with this	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	humans are not usually biased	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are! 
__label__Support	I've found the same, whereas our Labour MP lives here, his kids go to school here, and he really shows up in the community 	I think over the past few years the UK has become bit of a joke on the world stage. We need to build up our credibility again for sure! 
__label__Support	"""There are many people who can help with that"" (Esther Robinson Wild)"	People will become dumber. 
__label__Attack	newspapers are biased - they don't reflect balanced opinions	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	This goes beyond just technical issues, it is also a matter of civilization for the general public to show it cares about fellow citizens with disabilities.	We need a minimal set of protection measures (masks, ventilation...) in public spaces and public transportation.
__label__Support	"I agree to a certain extent - like Wikipedia, if anyone can contribute then there is no way to validate what's been said, and it can create ""Fake News""."	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	fully agree - there is zero trust in out politition across the scale	Cost of living is way too high, also re-privatise the Rail lines, Gas, electric, as these are run by greedy big companies
__label__Attack	That could help, although that would take a long of time. Also at the end of the day, whoever writes hateful speech do not see the dangers of what they are doing. According to an article in The Guardian, some people think this is just the internet and it does not reflect true life.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Attack	OR we can try a a semi-automatic, holistic approach. I mean, it is important to let people talk about what they want, the comment section is an important place, where people can communicate. But some kind of moderation will be always needed. I find this study interesting: https://aclanthology.org/W18-4420.pdf	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Agree, moderation is the way to go, as hate speech should not be part of any media forums.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	It doesn't give a space for hate speech	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__Support	"In addition it would be helpful for there to be some form of data tracking to identify ""repeat offender'who go around spreading  hate speech consistently."	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__Support	I think wanting honest policions, the cost of living crisis and the NHS would be most people's concerns	Agree too much waiting time 
__label__Attack	Most newspapers are inherently biased so you can't really trust them to handle hate speech	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__Support	agreed 	There are way bigger issues than this, the government are not able to do much with this unless they enforced rules such as no driving for all population. The best way to help environment is to recycle yourself 
__label__Support	Trolling is human nature, it will never stop so measures need to be placed because this problem will never change unless people change.  https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I think it is part of the responsibility of having a website. If the newspaper is not listed as a +18 platform for using insults or hate speech, then young people would be affected.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	the website could give raise this this awareness and have a open discusion	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	It's not the funding its the inefficiency and waste of money. Why can't you return your crutches when finished with?	True but the same could apply to the Tories too
__label__Attack	Not very mature of an arguement	Inequality yes- but regarding what exactly?
__label__Attack	By eliminating the entire comment secion you would be getting rid of the freedom of readers comments	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Absolutely agree with this - so many people affected by it, we need prevention and treatment	How come you won't be voting?
__label__Support	Taxpayers will have to pay	The economy, defence, education, the environment, who would be a strong leader
__label__Attack	It'a difficult to filter abusive comments	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	https://www.unia.be/en/areas-of-action/media-and-internet/internet/how-to-deal-with-hate-speech	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.
__label__Attack	There are those that are going to use the platform to incite hate and this should be moderated with them being banned if identified	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship.  I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it.  Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.  Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy.  They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__Attack	They can already do this, take a look at social media policy and they can, but choose not to in fear of going against freedome of speech.	I think that there should be techologies that are able to scan and the comment section to detect and flag any offensive/vulgar words in the comments before the comments are published.
__label__Attack	I am pretty sure some sort of hate speech itself is an infringement of ones human right and somehow defies what democracy stands for so it still does not lead to the necessary democracy either	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	This will go against the purpose of public opinion. Public opinion is informative and sometimes educational	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	How it impacts everything we do from the weather and the heat to storms etc 	investmen tin people
__label__Attack	I agree, this is a very measured resoonse.	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__Attack	The fact is that the knowledge on climate change is still very limited. Assumptions that we make about the damage today could be disproved tomorrow. Take for example the holes in the Ozone. We discovered them with advances in technology, but no one is really sure that we caused them or even for how long they had actually been there. With advancements in technology there is little reason to believe we can't reverse some of these things.	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Attack	We have had the same crowd in charge for 14 years. Time for a change.	There's a labour shortage right now and the adult social care system is heavily reliant on migrant labour. Migrants are also less likely to use the NHS and other public services than non-migrants 
__label__Support	I agree that with the current level of technology there is no problem as to monitoring comment sections for offensive language. This can be easily removed.	"I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about ""A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments"" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm"
__label__Support	i agree with this, for there to be a clear definition before you post, not terms or rules in small writing	First, it would be important to define what hate speech is so that readers that want to post comments have a chance to self-modify their posts. Secondly, having a filter that will automatically block posts that contain proscribed words could also help to reduce the amount of hate speech featured in comments sections.
__label__Support	Heavy moderation by the newspapers could prevent people being able to post their opinions	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__Attack	It really depends on what type of personal data is being shared. I strongly believe in privacy because people can be crazy.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Tougher sentencing is needed, too. 	I agree that these are the most important issues
__label__Support	yes. I totally agree. They are so corrupt	I agree-having recently been in hospital, I was shocked and saddened by the state of the NHS
__label__Attack	Nothing will change. It never does	Our country is a mess 
__label__Support	Saves having a human moderator soft through hundreds of comments.	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__Attack	True, but people take freedom of speech and it gives them the right to say whatever they want, without fear of persecution	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I think with people reading less newspapers both hard copy and online, Print subscription circulations have fallen by 7% over the past two years, from 125 million overall to 116 million, while single-copy sales are down 11%, from 3.2 million in the first half of 2019 to 2.8 million in the first half of this year.17 Dec 2021, the papers are not going to give the time and effort to monitor the comments sections when there's nothing in it for them.	I believe that all types of hate speech should be removed. All comments should be pre assessed by an overlooked before comments are posted. We should still be able to comment and have freedom of speach to express an opinion, but no hate speech.
__label__Support	i agree with this completely	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Integrity does seem to be in short supply	The thing is that parties like reform are very good at persuasive speech and knowing what to say but telling what their true beliefs are rather than what theyre saying jjust to make us like them is difficult!
__label__Attack	I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated, but I don't think that it requires the total removal of space for comments, as the comments add value. I believe that moderation is the way forward.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Would probably be very hard to actually do anything about people posting hateful comments	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Support	I agree - the NHS has been wrecked by the present Government and is being privatised by stealth to the detriment of the NHS	Conduct of Tory government in office, illegal immigration, policing of 'non-crime hate incidents'

__label__Attack	Who will moderate it? Can local papers afford to hire people to moderate every comment?	Moderation of the comments section
__label__Support	Agreed, possibly the worst, lying incompetent and corrupt political party to form a government	I agre Brexit is a disaster but no party is going to tackle that. A referendum on rejoining the sngle maRKET? a PRIATE MEMBERS BIL MIGHT DIO IT?
__label__Support	While this would eliminate all hate speech, newspapers would not implement it, as the interaction drives hits on their site, so the comments section is an essential part of spreading the news person to person	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	But with freedoms we have to consider the repsonsibilities that come along with those. Your frredoms dont give you a right to infringe uopn anothers right by discriminating agaisnt them. Majority of constituions talk about freedoms and right but we cannot be only selfish and forget about anothers right to freedom and dignity.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	We shouldn't have to see it regardless.	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__Support	I agree that most if not all online news articles do not need a comments section. However, I believe having a note to tell readers to be well mannered would not stop readers from posting hate speech if they had intended to do so in the first place.	By not providing comment section not unless the article need their opinion. There'll be a note notifying readers to be well mannered.
__label__Attack	time consuming	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__Attack	True, in detail without being disrespectful or bullying	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I definitely agree on the part of sciencing valid criticism	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	who do you think can turn things around? It is definitely needed 	I know the conservatives have been awful over the last 14 years but it seems people have forgotten how much worse previous Labour governments have been 
__label__Attack	I agree and as stated in this article (https://www.impactplus.com/blog/no-comment-why-companies-continue-to-move-away-from-comment-sections-on-their-website) it is possible to see that some websites actually already deleted the comment sections. They turned out to be quite useless as mostly trolls were commenting, while no interesting discussions were there anymore.	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.
__label__Support	I believe having the ability to read through the comments of other is very important when making decisions. The fact that monitoring is weak across most platforms is the biggest issue.	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__Attack	We need to start somewhere as people will just carry on if nothing is done	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Support	with you there!! 	I do think that Covid hugely affected the NHS and this would be difficult for the government to fix overnight (in addition to the funding crisis). 
__label__Support	Young people can be eliminated, who are likely to hate speech because of lack of information.	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__Support	I agree that it can be very challenging. But what good is it to just give up. We have to at least try to make change, no matter how hard it can be. We just have to learn how to make the right types of changes. 	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	Agree, and to be held accountable for their promises 	my rent doubled 18 mths ago and new contract means it will continue to rise, it will never go back down. Plus I have no housing security.

__label__Support	Companies will make more effort in regulating online presence if they are held accountable by law	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__Attack	Communication alone is not enough without systemic change	We need to improve communication and engagement with consumers
__label__Support	"I think this is good and supports freedom of speech, but at the same time, we cant really control ""aggressiveness"" in people especially considering that the degreees of acceptable aggressiveness varies with each person"	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I was once asked to consider being a politician and my answer was, I can't because I am too honest! So yes, not surprised any politician is 100% honest...name one who is if you do know of him/her/they	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!
__label__Support	I agree, it should not be removed but rather directed	Everyone shoould be able to express their own ideas but we could have some kind of protection in words the should not be allowed and also have a way to keep moderators on the website, people could be warned that they are doing something wrong and be explained that there IS NO HATE SPEECH and be offered maybe some way to express herself without hurting or damaging others.
__label__Support	unfortunately it is just pure greed, rent has gone way past being affordable now, caps work in lots of other countries, so theres no reason why they cant work here. Buy to let mortgages are at such high rates, thats why rent is so high. Greed by the landlords and greed by the banks 	It could increase democratic legitimacy of the Commission
__label__Support	I completely agree. It's not the job of online sites to become speech police. I frequent many different online comment sections, and oddly enough, hateful comments are swiftly dealt with by other contributors. Sometimes the best way to eliminate hate speech, is to allow it to be seen, then vastly condemned by those seeing it.  Algorithms should be used to deal with trolling. Honest, sometimes brutal comments should not censored just because they make others uncomfortable.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	how do we mute these comments? Cencorship?	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__Attack	Removing the platform is a preferable one	By monitoring individual responses and removing those not deemed suitable for publication
__label__Attack	couldn't agree more. We should eradicate homeless. 	I worry for those that are less fortunate than I am 
__label__Attack	Discussion will always happen. This would encourage discussion to happen elsewhere in forums without direct reference to the news article or without any moderation. It also pushes discussion into social media platforms where discussion tends to be more polarised and less productive.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Yes, this is a very crucial point. Something which is hate speech for a particular ideology might not be so for others.	I agree that positive communication will be important - perhaps that starts with us working through not only areas of consensus but also identifying some of the fears / assumptions around which disagreements foment? 
__label__Support	Yeah. That's true anyway. Freedom of speech is good but protecting the citizens and preventing violence through hate speech is also great	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	we will not hear other peoples opinion, so this is not a good idea	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Posistive for who? One of the reasons for comment section is to promote socialising amongst readers not just or the newspaper itself	lts true hate speech should be taken as positive criticism
__label__Support	This allows for people to understand that something will be done if they conduct hate speech.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	I feel like we somehow need to be a little bit more specific on which tools could work, because many times it could also be difficult to set limits in what can be said and what not. I would say that we could use a sort of algorithm which can recognize offensive comments and delete them.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Automatic filtering technology can be improved continuously and I think it would reach an adequate level of censoring without limiting freedom of speech. Some social networks like Instagram already give an option for users to select if they want to see hate speech or not	A key factor that could make filtering unfair is the fact that is done merely by automatic detection tools without human vetting or control. 
__label__Attack	The Israeli side is not ready to engage in real political negotiations	Communication with consumers is challenging due to activist voices dominating the discourse
__label__Support	absolutely, punishment should be given more often (within reason of course)	The EU is already good at foresight but struggles to act on it
__label__Attack	The removal of the comment gives a clear warning to contributors that hate speech is not tolerated and that if they use offensive language then their opinion will not be heard.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	Flagging comments would be good	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__Support	Agree- though there should also be some information provided as to why a comment has been deleted. For example, if someone uses a racial slur, they could be educated on why others may find it offensive. Rather than just blocking the comment.	"Flag known and ""popular"" derogatory terms automatically through the platform which does not allow you to post the comment without using the politically correct terms"
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Yess, thats totally correct. In order to reduce hate speeches there shoyld not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I do think that Covid hugely affected the NHS and this would be difficult for the government to fix overnight (in addition to the funding crisis). 	Also they all seem to spend all the time having a go at each other instead of telling us what we need to know about what they are going to do and how they are going to pay for it.
__label__Support	Algorithms and AI are much more advanced than the common person thinks. AI is able to discern intent. It is not solely based on keywords like a primitive AI from 30 years ago.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	The best way forward would be for both sides to respect the 1967 borders	Policy changes often face resistance from powerful industry lobbies
__label__Attack	Hate speech causes a lot of issues so it's nearly impossible to ignore. As much as we may have the right to freedom of speech, we also have the responsibility to engage responsibly.	Freedom of speech is important - however hate speech is not important to debate
__label__Attack	Enabling colleagues requires agile systems and processes, or change and improvements to existing ones, within a timeframe where inspiration is still present. Otherwise it can lead to frustration.	Deliberative democracy will focus on co-creating new ideas with broad citizen engagement.

I have a really cheap mobile phone and car - went without both of these for nearly 10 years and stick to a budget of what I can afford on food. We eat healthily - I don't drink or smoke. And I put my children first. Makes me so mad when people say they can't afford to but their child a book etc. Why -they are 10p from the charity shop or free at the library??

__label__Attack	Bringing Social Media into the discussion is irrelevant in my opinion. We're specifically talking about removing hate speech from newspaper websites.

__label__Support	encourages social participation and reflection	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	yes, but we need to motivate  their continuous participation.	This will lead to more inclusive and representative decision-making
__label__Attack	yes, and don't remove all post, just the part that contains what is termed hate speech,	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Support	Self-opinion is illogical at times, but people are entitled to whatever non-harmful opinions they like. Except in the case of psychics and other charlatans.	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__Attack	Yes people are very technological savvy and capable of using fake accounts to continue spreading whatever comments without consideration and that makes it hard to trace them.	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__Support	I agree that a change of government is needed, but realistically no other party has any valid reasoning of what exactly they will do to help. All as bad as each other! 	the winning party gets 5 years but only about 40% of those who vote back it. mostly conservatives win 3 out 4 of all elections its unfair and most people are not represented in any government
__label__Support	Technology is ever changing. Maybe what we currently have cannot make lasting change, but it can make a change in the right direction. As technology updates, we can do more.

Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	I think that a lot of comments can become personal or contain misinformation that does not really benefit anyone though.	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__Attack	it is censorship	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__Attack	Readers should be able to challenge the editorial views of the newspaper / individual journalist otherwise the newspaper just becomes an echo chamber.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	It is hard to rely on awareness campaigns, as people who write hate speech are not very interested in any awereness campaing	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.

__label__Support	Good. As long as it wasn't reported and the opinion was well written.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	There must be some sort of check not censorship	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	fully agree	Saw a depressing documentary about the NHS and heard doctors say there are not enough medicines.  This is because there are too many people now on our small island, so I link it all to education problems and immigration, I fear.
__label__Support	yes! This is exactly what i said	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__Attack	Banning comments only based on keywords will remove certain comments fore sure but won't help in reducing hate speech	Using tool, that automaticully remove discussions where is wrong kind words
__label__Attack	I totally agree. There are people who like to read comments. It is also a right to express an opinion.	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__Attack	The public are not experts and their views should not be publicised as such.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	as long that bot will be consistently and effectively enforced	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments
__label__Attack	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down. 	this is a comment on Bla #

It may say every one must use electric vehicles, every home must have minimum no of trees grown to counteract the man made damage
__label__Support	only farage will solve this :)	SNP being the only viable option for a Scottish person to vote for. Every other party's communications have focused on stopping another party, which i ffind strange as we're talking about running a country
__label__Attack	I'm not sure how voting a particular way helps cost of living, Electricity/gas/water prices are set by the companies, food prices are set by the retailers. the government doesnt control these things.	Agree fully with the NHS and economy section.  I need action taken to support my mortgage for example as it's going to almost double in 3 years when my fixed rate ends. 
__label__Support	The NHS definitely needs to have more funding and improved	Do we all agree that the cost of living is the biggest issue right now?
__label__Support	I think people take comments sections with a pinch of salt - they aren't creating fake news, they're often just expressing opinions, providing context or simply having fun.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	freedom of speech needs to be maintained whilst making sure other people's rights are not violated and people do not have to read 'hate speech' which is offensive to them personally,	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	Education only goes so far - some people will just ignore this policy. Perhaps just removing hate speech manually, or having a review process so only non-hate speech comments are published may be better.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I am not sure if this will happen 	Bring back legal routes for immigrants with speedy processing of claims
__label__Support	Agreed	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__Attack	Why? Most have worked hard for their money and paid a lot of tax on it already. Discourages hard work investment and innovation.	"We need people in the NHS who know about the NHS not so called ""managers"" who know nothing about how the NHS works.

__label__Support	I agree with this because as much as one has freedom of speech, be mindful of others and do not be disrespectful	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__Attack	quite an optimistic way to see it	Hate speech is hidden love that is just imperfectly expressed and should be protected 
__label__Attack	this would be very difficult to police, although i do think its a good starting point	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It's the politicans who are pseudo Brexiteers who weren't totally behind it that messed it up. Give Farage a chance. Can't be any worse than the ones we've had so far 	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!
__label__Attack	Why do people read comment sections? To get informed and enlightened or because they are nosy and killing time? I think most of the time is the latter. I am not sure the comments expressed at the bottom of a page bring more value to the conversation than they bring potential offence, hatred and fights started just for the fun of it.	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__Attack	Disagree, there are ways to reduce hate speech, but they need to be implemented correctly.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	The comment section should be a safe where everyone is free to place their opinion and ask question without someone making them feel somehow about themselves.	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__Support	There is a growing body of evidence that everybody - not just the vulnerable - wearing masks significantly reduces the viral load in a confined space.	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious 
__label__Attack	hate speech can be controlled by way of manual review or even bots programmed to look out for flagged words	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__Attack	i agreed it. because this is only by our hand to protect our planet from this climate change issue. so we have to should use green energy sources only in future.	No. sorry i not accept Climate change is not a hoax. we also feel in real life. we need more awarness
__label__Support	yes it is utter chaos!	Voting for a smaller party is a protest vote. Not voting just gives the 2 main parties less competition 
__label__Attack	This would create issues of illegibility and would only create more confusion as to the user's intent when the comment was made.	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech

__label__Attack	I think the writer can decide	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__Support	We do have to adapt and evolve with the shifting climate. It's too late to halt the process entirely.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	I disagree. I think other readers of hate speech could be influenced by it making the issue spread even further. You can share your opinions without using hate speech and with a balanced approach so it should be removed.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	But the major newspapers are already owned by large corporations who have vested interest in political parties and financial matters. It is hard for liberal or independent news to break through the noise. Comments help to balance the conversation.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I think that is a very good idea	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__Attack	There are always other spaces, such as reddit or twitter, where one can discuss articles- they do not have to be discussed on the same page they are presented	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	it would be nice if the comment could be made visible after it has been removed. others can know what to avoid and if it is NOT actually hate speech the conversation could be continued don't you think?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	i hope you realise the number of people coming on boats is tiny. The media love to use this tactic to make you hate the wrong people 	Probably not. Most elections are really a case of trying to pick the best of a bad bunch. 
__label__Attack	No hiding behind false ID	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__Attack	Education about hate speech has been around and people still practice hate speech	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	It is a good idea to not completely  remove comment sections as that discourages user interaction	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	True, creates a hurdle that some people don't wanna do	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments

__label__Attack	But software is not near good enough to accurately identify hate speech all the time. Language is complex and you can't pin HS through banning or flagging certain terms and phrases only.	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between  violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	Tasking whole units with not only moderation of hate speech but also tracking it and analysing it for trends is a huge additional workload for an already stretched sector. It sounds great, but likely unrealistic in terms of newspaper resources.	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Attack	I don't agree with removing the space for views to be aired. That is an important part of challenging and changing opinion. I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated so finding the users and punishing them is key.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	reduces freedom of speech	Having certain words being banned or marked as inappropriate might help reduce hate speech. Systems that moderate what is being said and shared and the option to report hate speech might be helpful.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is a probelm, and to discredit any potential help is not the answer. Trials and attempts could be made to fix this issue. A good way to do so would be to use human modetors who are netural, to ensure that there is fairness.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	A good point, a lot of memes may be seen as offensive and may be flagged as such. There is the man I saw on the news who made a video for YouTube and made his dog do an offensive stance as a joke and ended up with prison time, it depends on how far a joke could go and the stance of those seeing the joke. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-43478925	"While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech.

An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as ""memes"" containing racism and sometimes  the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230"
__label__Support	a more toward automation	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__Support	Exactly. People want to feel as if they are part of the conversation. Removing the comment section just has the opposite effect.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I agree but what is to be done about those who use hate speech? Do we just let them be? And what about the newspaper's reputation? Should they be known as a newspaper that allows people to comment on whatever they like with no repercussions?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Th Un have argued that we need to address hate crime https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.

__label__Attack	Not a big issue. You're brainwashed by right wing media distracting you from the real issues 	I also agree, while the Tories have been awful with regard to LGBTQ rights, I don't think Starmer has been strong enough in rebutting them.
__label__Attack	i don't agree with this - you should be able to give an opinion if it is valid and relevant.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	The comment space gives users a way to vent out their frustration. It is not always nice to see derogatory language but when there is a healthy discussion, it helps people reading them to find very informative.	"I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language.

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Social media platforms are far from perfect at dealing with hate speech, it may even be detrimental because it would allow a lot more people to comment and therefore a lot more hate could potentially be displayed	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.

__label__Attack	blocking certain words could automatically delete comments that are not necessarily hateful to another person	I think by blocking certain terms that are hateful when responding to others in comments i.e., you are an idiot, loser etc. Hate speech should not be present online.
__label__Attack	I think the fact that Facebook, one of the richest companies in the world, struggle with moderation points to the fact that small local newspapers would struggle. Especially if one of their stores goes viral or something.	Moderation of both users and comments isn't difficult to implement and will weed out the idiots that want to ruin it.
__label__Attack	People will tick that they agree, but write what they want anyway! And if they're anonymous there are no repercussions for them.	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__Support	definitely agree with this comment,there is no place for aggression in an adult debate	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I think you are confusing hate speech with a controversial opinion. Hate speech would be saying a racist word 5 times; a controversial opinion would be that dinosaurs don't exist because of the square cube law.

__label__Attack	Costly to the company to pay for dedicated moderators	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__Support	I doubt Starmer is going to go for this, I hope he does though, but he has been taking a lot of 'gifts' from the rich lately, people trying to get him onside.

Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Attack	If a newspaper does not do anything, it might facilitate hate speech and help it reach to millions of people by simply hosting it on their website. Therefore there is a responsibility.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

As a sector, we do our best but the Public Sector should focus on things such as the skill gap for instance"" (Chris Jofeh, Consultant to Arup and Chair of the independent Decarbonisation of Homes in Wales Advisory Group)"	Inconsistent application of planning policy and conservation guidance means that improvement proposals meet with widely different and unpredictable responses in addition to delays caused by the strained planning system. 
__label__Support	I like this idea as it contains inbuilt responsibility, so it motivates the people in power to fix it, and competition between different newspapers will breed more effective methods to reduce hate speech effectively, which other platforms will copy and adapt	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__Attack	I think using personal data would be tricky. Many companies have been caught selling user's data without consent or storing it in an unsafe way, which could harm those affected by hate speech more than those who post it	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far.

__label__Attack	not well explained	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech.  Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire.  In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing.  On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen.  So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Attack	The fact is that the knowledge on climate change is still very limited. Assumptions that we make about the damage today could be disproved tomorrow. Take for example the holes in the Ozone. We discovered them with advances in technology, but no one is really sure that we caused them or even for how long they had actually been there. With advancements in technology there is little reason to believe we can't reverse some of these things. 	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Support	Some of the thoughts that people need to 'clear' may offend others.	"I found this really interesting, ""Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend."" This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

__label__Support	I agree, I'm a soon to be new parent & the lack of support there is for childcare or paying insane prices for nurseries etc means that we're being forced to work without spending too much time with our child.	what does that even mean??
__label__Attack	There is no way that the Whigs will ever be a major Political Party	There are plenty of brownfield land, I don't know why we can't build on that 
__label__Support	I agree with you, i feel like thats what media is about, expressing ourselves.	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__Support	it might have a negative effect on other people, sometimes it might even be harmful	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I disagree with this because newspapers can lose readers due to poor interaction	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Here for this!	Provide proper support for carers 
__label__Attack	I think there are bigger fish to fry at the moment. 	"NOT. To ""sort"" climate change we need to do a LOT, and one of those absolutely mandatory requirement is to use clean energy - no matter the cost"
__label__Attack	Good Argument but at the same time we must look at how it affect people live most people commit suised because of hate speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree with this statement.  All hate speech can be removed if being monitored properly.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Newspapers role is already to sell information, censorship can be done without doing comments with hate speech.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	This is true because it takes the focus away from the real news!	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__Support	Also agree that one-income households should be able to live a comfortable life for their children. There are not enough nursery places for all children so some will inevitably have to be cared for at home anyway, and parents who make that choice for whatever reason should be supported in doing so.	what does that even mean??
__label__Support	I also agree because reading what people thinks about your work or your outlet is important. if not then how could the writer improve?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	great idea	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful. We obviously can not control what people do but by filtering the comment section we can limit what people can and can not say.
__label__Attack	The hate speech will go underground and may appear in other closed forums or whatsapp groups.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	The government should be focusing on taxes to help improve the econamy	Numbers on benefits too many cut the money paid to them 
__label__Attack	It is still difficult because then you are removing everyone's entitlement to an opinion	By totally eliminating the comments section because most it kills reporters confidence and it may lead to hate speech and fake news
__label__Support	definetly needs sorting i thghink adopting australias policy with letting skilled workers immigrate would be good 	The state of the health service is one of the biggest problems we have, and the NHS one of our biggest assets (despite the problems with its running). It's being dismantled and I think regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, most of the public would fight to save it.
__label__Attack	This would be a lazy attempt to reduce hate speech as it doesn't allow for people to make genuine, thoughtful expressions of opinion that is useful for others to read.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	also would allow anyone to say whatever hate they havem to say	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__Support	Would provide personalized, relevant information to citizens	Economic inequalities are a major threat to liberal democracy
__label__Support	collapsing the comment section is not the solution because people have freedom of speech however those who make hateful comments can be flagged or banned from using the site	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I definitely agree	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I agree freedom of speech is important but hate speech should not be allowed	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Banning comment section is not a solution at all, the ban of comment sections is also the ban of freedom of speech/ opinions over all. The idea behind comment sections is for readers to share their different thoughts regarding the News with each other which is very important.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Where is this magic money tree, please tell me, I would love to know.  Doctors do private work which they get paid for. If everyone strikes then it has a knock on effect on everything else. 	If in doubt, remember that you are not voting for a party, or for a Prime Minister - you are voting for one MP to represent you, so vote for the one you think will do the best job and who shares most of your views.
__label__Support	A certain language criteria would be a better solution , restricting the limitations to ways of expression only 	haters may be removed is the system is able to identify them...so I think comment space can be kept but regulated 
__label__Attack	Immigration is not the cause of problems in this country, just blamed by politicians and the media 	I'm 50/50 on this. Nothing is wrong with immigration if people are skilled and are willing to be skilled. If there is a lack of people wanting to up-skill, why not allow the immigrants to take the jobs!
__label__Support	and the shrinkflation - product sizes becoming smaller and prices still going up! 	We need tough laws, which punish offenders, but with the state of the prisons, namby pamby judges, the criminal fraternity can almost act with impunity, as we are far too undermanned in the police.

__label__Support	Yes it is best to focus on your own life and the people around you. Politics on tv is just theatre	i am not sure if this is recording what i say
__label__Support	Reduced aggression could lead to less retaliation. If an idea/thought is presented in a balanced way, then a respondent may hopefully be inclined to respond accordingly.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I think this solution can be very intrusive. Especially in a times where our personal data is being collected as a commodity.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Slows down discussion.	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names.  Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__Support	"Opinions shouldn't be classed as ""hate speech"". If some people (snowflakes) get triggered by different points of view they should refrain from reading the comments section rather than whine about ""hate speech""."

__label__Support	agree - too much corruption in the current government	I agree-having recently been in hospital, I was shocked and saddened by the state of the NHS
__label__Support	Fully agree!	I agre Brexit is a disaster but no party is going to tackle that. A referendum on rejoining the sngle maRKET? a PRIATE MEMBERS BIL MIGHT DIO IT?
__label__Attack	Immigration is good for the economy  	In some ways I disagree, as renters have a right to earn money during the increased housing costs, but also I do agree that kicking people out when they decide to up the prices is horrific. It should be that an agreed price is arranged and the government do something to make sure that the need for increased rent is limited. 
__label__Attack	Citizens may lack sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions on complex budget issues	The two-state solution is no longer viable
__label__Support	Yes - it makes all other issues worse	voting tactically  is popular
__label__Attack	It risks depressing people	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	What is hate speech? 	A key factor that could make filtering unfair is the fact that is done merely by automatic detection tools without human vetting or control. 
__label__Support	I do agree that comments shouldn't be closed.	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__Attack	Seems to involved and complicated for most to even want to try. 	I think it can be reversed, but it's going to take a collective effort from a lot of individuals to start this process.
__label__Attack	Differing opinions mare easily recognized for what they are. Whereas as hate speech can spark a lot of dangerous events. The comment's section helps people share knowledge easily and if it's not serving that purpose then it should not be allowed.  https://researchoutreach.org/articles/hate-speech-regulation-social-media-intractable-contemporary-challenge/	The problem with moderating means that people may have a stance on what counts as a hate comment and may cause differing opinions and deletions of stuff that may just be outside someone's comfort zone https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Attack	the focus is on women because they a more vulnerable than men. if a woman is attacked its all over the media, if a man gets attacked no one cares	I agree, sinve Boris Johnson was PM it seems to have become acceptable to lie, and use public office to enrich oneself and one's friends
__label__Support	While I agree with this statement, I would like to mention that public consultations have long been employed by governments to collect ideas and opinions. I believe to a certain extent the people are also to blame as they are so used to the conventional representative democracy while not trying to go beyond participating in elections.	This will build trust and facilitate broader adoption
__label__Support	Social media promotes unrealistic beauty standards and can harm self-esteem	Social media and AI have negative impacts on society, particularly on young people
__label__Support	If carbon dioxide emissions were to decrease, the absorption of carbon dioxide by plant life and through the oceans would remain the same. I think millions of years is a very pessimistic estimate. Our planet tends to balance itself out within a shorter time frame. 	By letting the earth heal itself and be left alone. The earth has made it this long and I assume and really think it will make it long after we are gone. There are probably some small things we can do here and there, but for the most part the earth can take care of itself.
__label__Attack	Algorithms aren't that sophisticated. They might miss stuff, or label as hate speech something that isn't	I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__Attack	Commenting on online platforms with hate speech is a lazy, cowardly way of spreading negativity. If those who partake in this sort of online behaviour lacked the platform to do this, I don't think they would act out in other ways. I think they spread hate online as it's a very easy way to do so and takes no energy and is anonymous.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	Statement made with knowledge	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Support	I totally agree. I am hearing more people getting fed up with our country. We need to be able to speak out and not be afraid 	There has to be fairness somewhere
__label__Support	It removes the problem of potential hate speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	They are a business and therefore hold the control over what is said in their comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Although people might abuse the flagging, however, if there are reviewers to do their work on those flags, these comments that have been flagged intentionally would not be removed.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	While I mostly agree, I question whether a newspaper's goal is engage in discussion. It would likely depend on the paper. Some print media is certainly for discussion.	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__Support	yes very important, they won't be weak when dealing wth Trump or Putin	yes kind off but their are other issues that need dealing with
__label__Support	I agree,that way people aren't bullied online.	I think people should be able to express their feelings, but there should be a way to block hate speech
__label__Attack	No, there is human vetting processes also. But in many scenarios, the 1st round of filtering is done by automatic detections and then they go through human vetting, which may lead to scenarios with wrongly filtering comments.	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are!

__label__Attack	Surely arguing and debating is the whole point. Otherwise how do we thrash out a plan of action? Find out what other people think and why?	Taxing the richest will make them move to Italy or Spain for £100,000 to be tax free. These are some of our biggest employers.NOOO THANKSA
__label__Attack	Violating the right to freedom of speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I don't think this is about negative and positive comments but limiting someones ability to spread hate speech.	hate speech online will always be there and we shouldn't focus on hate speech a lo because there will be a lot of positive comments
__label__Support	Farage is a grifter, appeals only to the gullible.	General taxing... We need to raise the base rate which will help put money in pockets to pay for these rise in bills.  Taxing big companies like Shell and Amazon will surely help claw some money back too
__label__Attack	Economists argue that immigration is good for an economy 	Ive also noticed a massive change in my food bill over the past 3 years - not even that long of a time frame
__label__Support	Really like that idea	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__Support	hopefully this doesnt happen 	more should be done to stop us wasting energy and water

__label__Support	Proportional Representation is likely the only way we are going to have future elections feel like they represent the majority of the country. 	Immigration is crucial to everything - can't run a country properly with all the services we need with crazy numbers 
__label__Support	I agree. I think that nothing is being done to help renters and this is one solution that can help. 	It could increase democratic legitimacy of the Commission
__label__Attack	comments can dilute the validity of the story	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Support	Childcare is so expensive now, I don't know how people cope 	what does that even mean??
__label__Attack	If we don't ask corporations to step in and get involved, then we're ignoring the biggest contributor of this issue - EVERYBODY needs to be involved.	Placing blame and/or trying to figure out who's at fault is pointless. It doesn't matter if it's the corporations, individuals, or natural processes--the problem exists, whatever the cause. And it has to be addressed, even if it's expensive, even if it's monumental, even if it seems impossible to solve--because without working toward a solution, our planet and ourselves will cease to exist.
__label__Attack	A rights-based argument in this case would also need to consider that protection from discrimination is also a fundamental human right. Hate speech, even if a form of freedom of expression, still infringes on this. The ECRI goes into this in more detail at: https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	The current education system is outdated and doesn t address modern technological challenges	The education system needs to be reformed to address challenges posed by social media and AI
__label__Attack	Having real people that moderate comments on a newspaper website where there are thousands of comments is unrealistic. At best you could have an algorithm that auto bans comments that contain key words and/or phrases and then have those reviewed by a real person.	I agree with the point of view that there should be a broad spectrum of moderators to stop any particular biased opinion or agenda from controlling the comments.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses 	Automatic filtering technology can be improved continuously and I think it would reach an adequate level of censoring without limiting freedom of speech. Some social networks like Instagram already give an option for users to select if they want to see hate speech or not  
__label__Attack	I believe that newspapers are supposed to spark a conversation, the conversation should be had directly in the comment section and should not be moved to different platforms	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Support	YES	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Support	Agreed - I don't feel represented by any of the parties at the moment, so for me it's a case of choosing the 'least of all evils', and I don't feel comfortable doing that, but at the same time, don't feel comfortable being silent	I also agree on healthcare. I'm particularly worries about inaction towards Long Covid patients
__label__Attack	Who gets to decide what qualifies as hate speech?  If I criticize someone from a protected class for their own bad behavior, what's to stop them from shielding themselves from that criticism by claming it to be hate speech?	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	very true, people get too worked up online and post things they would never say IRL.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	that's a good question	I've thought about this and I've come to the conclusion that public apathy is what fuels politicians to misbehave because they think they can get away with it because no-one cares. Voting shows you care. IMO.
__label__Support	I think the NHS is high on everyone's comments so far	Are they telling the truth?
__label__Support	there is not enough being done towards climate change	poorly worded I admit, I meant how those who have immeasurable amounts of money are able to get away without taxation while the rest of us are so harshly punished 
__label__Support	It will eliminate hate speech	"Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech.

__label__Attack	Whilst I agree that the platforms should be responsible, with the vast numbers of people contributing to some platforms it is virtually impossible to moderate every single comment.	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__Support	Removing comment sections on newspapers, enables limited misinformation and discrimination to reproduce.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	I doubt that labour will be any different	Bottom-up approaches have more legitimacy
__label__Support	i agree with this comment,	There can be a filtering system that filters hate speech
__label__Attack	I don't think that we should choose either mitigation or adaptation. It seems that both are very useful tools to fight climate change and other environmental concerns.	If people can start separating strategies to help the earth and politics, I would be more apt to believe it.   An example is the new green deal that is being proposed in the US.  When you read it, a majority is about socialist policies and overreach of the government and is not relevant in anyway to climate change.  Other agreements let large polluters like China and India off the hook while expecting a disproportionate amount from the US.   This makes me very cynical about the overall agenda behind it.
__label__Support	Bigger than that; 1/3 of existing dwellings are of traditional (solid wall/naroow cavity) construction, and 75% of building work is to existing dwellings. This is not a niche. In this we differ substantially from most EU countries. BUT comfort doesn't necessarily equate to higher temperature, it's more about relative humidity and temperature differentials between people and surfaces.

__label__Attack	Algorithms can't be depended on. They will likely hold the bias of the creator or can't be smart enough to be reliable sources of end of for comment removal.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	Everyone is entitled to their opinions	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__Support	100% agree punishment is becoming less and less and it needs to change and enforce the law	"This is a second hand opinion and I agree with it:  ""When a political party is in power for a long period of time, it tends to become more ""left"" or more ""right.""  When this happens it is  time for change."""
__label__Support	I think it would be a good idea to ban commenters for some time, they should be issued with the reasons why their post is offensive at the same time	the comments with hate speech can be remove. and the commenter should be ban for a period of time
__label__Support	I dont believe in privatisation either!  	Agree, need a fairer distribution of resources. But are Labour bold enough to tackle this? 
__label__Support	The media should not be in control of what we view, though. And I can see the side of your thinking. Perhaps with the option to view said removed comments makes this more plausible for you? I wonder how that changes your opinion, if at all of course.	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__Attack	This may be true to an extent, but it isn't a reason to give up on making positive change to create a better future.	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Support	Given time that is almost a certainty	taxes, cost of living crisis, support for palestine 
__label__Support	I agree, people should have the newspaper identify hate speech, but also the newspaper needs to actually evaluate the reported comments	I'm not sure if it will work but they can  put a sign on the website that says no to hate comments allowed. Or a report button can also help then administrator can review the reported comments
__label__Attack	We should avoid appearing like we are doing cancel culture	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__Attack	We have so many vacancies in low-paid jobs which are usually taken an immigrant workforce. Loads in NHS and agriculture	I believe that whilst we all want solutions, I honestly don't think any party has the capability to achieve.
__label__Support	Housing is definitely a big issue in this country- same as overcrowding. Unfortunately working in the construction industry the situation is harder too and not many developers are able to provide as much (which is normally 10-15% handed to councils from new developments) ore money needs to be put behind construction industry and help for councils as they also make things difficult from housing/built perspective 	They are not honest and will not fulfil their promises when elected.
__label__Attack	"https://diverseminds.co.uk/hatecrime/ - As much as you say this the effects of hate crime on an individual are not anything that should be allowed to flourish. If newspapers where to physically allow and endorse this type of ""free speech"" on their platform they simply shouldn't be able to have a platform. It also gives right of way for those who think with pure ignorance to voice a factually incorrect and exaggerated opinion. These are not the types of opinions that should be openly shared or taught on the internet and in any given situation that it could happen they need to restrict it. To reduce free speech may be an infringement but allow hateful speech is just wrong."	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	I tend to agree with this. In this way editors have a close look to what opinion can be published and which one entails hate speech.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Attack	The downside to this is who is going to moderate it - where is the baseline of what is acceptable and what is not.  It's a real challenge.	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__Support	100% agreed, has this would work has everyone needs to learn how to respect others	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__Support	Very much agree, leadership however is looking very poor no matter what we choose. Defence is something needs money spent right away, specifically if the Orange buffoon gets back in	Agree with rejoining EU but can't see how this will happen in next 5 years 
__label__Support	Agreed, this article shares the same views. Its should not be the Newspaper taking accountability	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I don't agree as I don't think it's that easy to mix up hate speech and an opinion, if you genuinley don't have any hateful intentions. For example, not liking an establishments choices is much different from major hate/offensive speech	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__Attack	If we need other peoples opinions before we can form our own then we are literally just looking for confirmation bias of what we already believe	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Free speech should be allow or we would be like communist countries	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__Support	Agree, price of food items is so much higher than a few years ago	My lack of trust in the integrity and competence of the Political parties. Particulary around the economy and social care
__label__Support	Easy to do	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Yep. Rather implement ways in which one can refrain from hate speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	Agree in every sense, ticket prices, reliability etc. 	I can see why you don't want to, but I think if you didn't vote and then were unhappy with the outcome you might be kicking yourself a bit that you didn't at least try. 
__label__Attack	agree brexit is a disaster, but thats democracy? cant change it because we didnt like it. we voted for it (i didnt, but the collective we, did) 	Yes, I agree and they seem to think that we all want tax reductions when I would ather the money was spent on helping the NHS, etc get back on its feet.
__label__Attack	Additional administrative workload and time factor for posting comments	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__Attack	It's a nice idea but requires a lot of investment to write the counterarguments. How do we ensure that time is worthwhile and the responses will even be effective?	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__Attack	that will still allow people to write hate speech, coz they can.	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__Attack	Yes cost of living is high but it has happened before and will happen again. Bailing people out is costly as well.	voting tactically  is popular
__label__Attack	we need to adopt to the current situation , we should not deny that we are responsible for all the problem that we create in accordance with situation	We cannot adopt but we should adopt to it because there is no other go with the affected environment unless helping the environment  less pollution
__label__Attack	"Calling on the denegration on other people is not ""Having an opinion"" your view is your own, and you can have it, however when that overlaps into criticising other people for no other reason than they are differrent is not a ""view"", it is bigotry.

__label__Attack	different people will have different interpretations of 'disrespectful'	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	It is often very flawed and can flag up false positives	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__Support	Sharing how we all have learning from failure is very refreshing	Technological developments will enhance democracy and address current issues. 
__label__Attack	but the newspaper cannot be liable for how people respond,considering that most website are visited by adults with responsibilities.	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?

__label__Attack	I believe that too much damage has already been done by governments around the world especially due to geoengineering tactics that have already caused harm that cannot be reversed.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	Couldn't agree more 	Inequality yes- but regarding what exactly?
__label__Attack	Why are you not prepared to think there is an alternative. Why do we have to put up with the illusion of choice. When a system is broken why would we look for a solution to that problem from within that same system? We need to think bigger. 	Hard to disagree with anything that you've said.  All crucial and will affect almost everybody.
__label__Support	yes which is worrying 	Tax policies aim to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share.
__label__Support	but doesn't the detection ai get better at filtering the more it works?

__label__Attack	This is unlikely to be feasible.  United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.
__label__Support	But also... an open comment section provides these individuals with a platform and instead of the desired open communication to educate people, it can be that more people become radicalised.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I think this is definitely important and will help but we need so much more than this. To me this is just one of the many important steps and changes we must make. All of these things and all of us working together can make a significant change.	I have heard that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference Closes with Limited Ambition
__label__Attack	does take a lot of work/ man power or bots which could over filter comment sections	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	Privacy issues. I know that my information are already somehow online but no one would be willing to give them freely, with the risk of being persecuted.

__label__Attack	"But hate speech hurts. We can't let it just run rife because  it's ""too hard"" to address."	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	if one matter is not given enough attention than that would have bad consequences as if might not reach a lot of people	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__Attack	If you eliminate comments completely you both take away the right to free speech and inhibit the ability to have an open discussion about what constitutes hateful and offensive comments	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__Support	I agree that the hate speech perhaps should not be entirely removed. Sometimes a society has to confront its own ugliness/hatred head on, and removing it might do more harm than good (ie making commenters feel persecuted, perhaps making them even more hateful or violent). I also agree that still being able to access the newspaper might help change their minds.	"Hate speech should be flagged, hidden and the user should be given a strike. People should be able to still view those comments with a ""trigger warning"" disclaimer. After 3 strikes the user should be banned from commenting. But they should still be able to view the newspaper so that they don't miss an article that probably would have helped that particular person to change their behavior . More safe and reliable ways of verifying accounts should also be implemented."
__label__Support	We will discuss solutions too	Neither of the main parties have given us reason to trust them, and even if smaller parties can be more scrupulous there's no point voting for them in a GE. It's all very frustrating. 
__label__Attack	Generic and slightly focused on positional 'senior' leaders rather than the leadership role everyone can step into.	I know there are mechanisms already in place but I feel that most people do not even know they exist.

__label__Attack	https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/15/20806384/social-media-hate-speech-bias-black-african-american-facebook-twitter	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with this comment	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!

__label__Support	I agree, and this can be further enocouraged if the writerr or journalist engages with the comments that are being made on their story	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	can be subjective what someone views as hate speech someone else might not agree	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr!  However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior.  Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!
__label__Attack	I've found this is quite a common position 	living crises and NHS waiting  list
__label__Support	That's true. Most social media companies are already using AI to detect and remove hate speech. Here's an article about this: https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__Attack	People should be allowed to express their opinions as long as they are done so respectfully	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I agree, there's so many people that cannot afford to properly live anymore	NHS Backlog, LGBTQ rights, housing crisis, cost of living
__label__Support	This is interesting! I read an article about moderators with different policies on what constitutes hate speech and should be removed. There is an argument that some are too strict and moderate incivility, rather than just hate speech.

__label__Support	Agreed, I have two young children and this worries me - as well as online content/social media and the lack of impetus the government has put of challenging large social media corporations 	More support for small businesses, start ups etc. From what I've seen it really isn't that good in terms of practical help, advice and support, seems to be run by councils ticking boxes and under qualified advisers speaking about the obvious 
__label__Support	100% - they are one and the same. 	Essentially agree on all of these plus add the NHS and social care
__label__Attack	There is some evidence that AI systems can be pretty effective at detecting hate speech! For example: https://ai.facebook.com/blog/how-ai-is-getting-better-at-detecting-hate-speech/	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__Attack	When people are given choice to comment, trolls will come out naturally and therefore so will hate speech. You can only educate those willing to be educated.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	I understand your point but I think you're misinterpreting the point of this. Hate speech is damaging and should not be condoned in any form, regardless of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech includes allowing people to talk about their opinions, but not threatening people or expressing prejudice against certain groups.	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.

__label__Attack	There is a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech. One is neccesary, intellectual and somewhat constructive without being rude. The other is a global problem causing suicide attempts and mental health issues.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	this is just a response with no constructive information. We cannot just say this, throw up our hands and walk away	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Attack	limitations are important.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	why? I am on a zero hour contract and I love it, I only work when I want to 	That's an excellent point in fairness. If they think they can get away with anything, you end up with characters like Donald Trump running the place.
__label__Attack	Simultaneously limits freedom of opinion. A censored comment section can hinder thought-provoking discussions	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Attack	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem but cause further frustration. It also takes away the opportunity for people to engage about issues and share ideas.

To me it's choosing the lesser of the evils	Immigration is crucial to everything - can't run a country properly with all the services we need with crazy numbers 
__label__Support	I totally agree with this statement.	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__Attack	they do have clear strategies, all the conservatives care about is that people dont vote labour	we need tax revenue topay for servises we can1t expect good infrastructure and effective public services for free
__label__Support	Users who want to comment will find other ways of doing so such as via facebook or other social media channels. Free speech needs to be permitted otherwise a balance is not provided.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I agree with this point of view - a lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	We're already experiencing an economic crisis. We can't just keep investing in preventing climate change. We have other priorities.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	However it could be argued that t it is so difficult for moderators to see the difference between someone practicing their freedom of speech and the idea of hate speech against a protected characteristic.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	User flagging would be perfect and yes modaretors but they won't be available all the time	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	And what good will that exactly do?	Probably not. Most elections are really a case of trying to pick the best of a bad bunch. 
__label__Support	Not all opinions can be respected, especially those that violate other people's rights and identities.	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__Attack	I think appointing moderators for this task is quite costly and it will be based on the subjective opinion of the moderator. Interference will prevent freedom of speech and will be a bit biased.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	Automatically hiding comments flagged inappropriate may promote hate speech as well, as coordinated groups may flag comments to target and suppress the speech of specific people.

__label__Support	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also

Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	This could be costly depending on how many articles there are to review	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	There has to be fairness somewhere	safe spaces for women 
__label__Support	How will a newspaper manage to do this?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I disagree as some comments are constructive and may help other users. Otherwise you just get an echo chamber.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Support	Sorry this one was too	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	But are moderators available to this? And who agrees what can be said and what can't be?	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__Attack	difficult to judge hate speech	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.

__label__Attack	(sorry I mean one in ten)	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive.

__label__Attack	The media is based on the idea that they have the freedom to write or speak about any topic they wish. To take that same idea away from other people to respond and contribute freely to what is being said would be the end of a diverse and opinionated society.

__label__Attack	i think you are in the minority here haha, most of the world are moving to the right, look at France, its almost going hard right. in the UK, we've had a right wing gov for 14yrs who havent exactly succeeded - ive not seen any left wing extremism anywhere! 	The amount of illegal immigration there is in the country. The cost of living crisis, food and energy prices
__label__Support	NHS funding is not keeping up with an ageing and growing population.	I think there has been a major breakdown in trust over the last few years
__label__Support	I agree that we, as humans, can adapt to the situation as best as possible. But we can also take small steps towards change. The situation doesn't have to be impossible. 	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	Being able to keep comments open is not a justification or a refutation of the presence of hate speech.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__Support	I also agree with both of your points. Its been making who to vote for really difficult for me. As i don't trust any of the parties will fulfil what we need.	There's a labour shortage right now and the adult social care system is heavily reliant on migrant labour. Migrants are also less likely to use the NHS and other public services than non-migrants

Such nasty comments can block your connection in near future	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I agree. The NHS needs a major overhaul I think. Funding should go to people on the frontline, not just  the higher ups.	that is the problem we face majorly health care and education need to be rectify
__label__Support	I cannot remember a more openly corrupt govt. From PPE scandal, to betting to partygate....just when you think they can't get lower they sink again.

__label__Attack	"@LawrenceM and @AndrewA said it best. This world is already in utter chaos. Humanity? Is that even a thing anymore.

__label__Support	It could reduce the presence of hate.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	This reduces free speech and lets the negative win	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	We cannot rely to other people to recognize hate	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship.  I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it.  Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.  Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy.  They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__Support	I would say the same	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I don't want responsibility 	"I really like the idea of working groups. This fosters more informal and free discussion, and makes the exercise more interactive. We could be ""itinerant"" facilitators. "

I know there are mechanisms already in place but I feel that most people do not even know they exist.

__label__Support	Could be effective to some extent as it could prevent hate speech being available on these websites	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__Attack	Totally get why Britain is on board to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels but the infrastructure is not there to support it. I do not think the country should bankrupt itself to try to achieve net-zero, when the majority of people can't afford EVs, or heat pumps. So only rich folk will be able to drive cars?  Can our roads cope with more EVs, which are much much heavier than normal cars? Also at the end of the day, until the likes of China and India buy into climate change and rein in their own industries, tiny little old Britain isn't really making a difference but will be making a lot of people miserable	Pledge to support NHS, pledge to support workers and workers rights, pledge not to raise taxes
__label__Support	i kind of agree...

__label__Support	I think moderation is key, so do agree!	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net. This would make more work for the newspapers but would only require one person to constantly monitor what is being submitted and only allow reasonable comments.
__label__Attack	This may end up filtering out individuals with valid opinions that just feel safer commenting anonymously.	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__Support	Yes it does - but without the label 'racist' when talked about	i think they go together as we have an ageing population we do need some immigration
__label__Attack	I don't think we should rely on AI or algorithms to safeguard comment sections. Algorithms are only as reliable as the coding, and that is done in total darkness.	"In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to ""teach"" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all."
__label__Attack	But then no-one can give useful positive advice	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I agree. Articles are written purely so that they can absorb hate comments to boost th e post.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I totaly agree, it will help to screen the comments in a way to avoid such incidences where people say things that can be hateful to another person. With the help of the technology i do belive this can be achieved in future to avoid being violated.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens. 
__label__Support	I agree with the idea that anonymity on the Internet often has the consequence to make it easier for people to harass / be horrible to each others.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Attack	Ai could be used to flag, but then an experienced arbitrator is needed to decide if item removed	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.

__label__Attack	I agree - but how do we do it whilst giving readers some protection?	Educate people about it
__label__Attack	I agree, I think it would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	Agreed. The same is happening on a global level... France, Trump...	Yes they are just in it for what they can get out of it
__label__Attack	Some dissenting opinions and hate comments can spur conversation and be used as a learning opportunity, but it is important for people who use hate speech to be removed from the platform if it becomes too much.

__label__Attack	I do agree with education and raising awareness but what about bots and people who simply want to cause trouble?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	that is true there are many ways to reduce hate speech from newspapers	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I don't agree, it just needs to be monitored whether by ai or human	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social  media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them.

__label__Attack	hate speech affects people differently, it might not affect some but it differently hurt others	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

At least appropriate measures can be taken in order to stop hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	but some newspapers will take advantage of readers	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.

__label__Support	I agree that key words could be added to some come of algorhythm to stop people using them.	There should be hate speech words that should be used to warn the user and not allow them to post by disabling the post button if there are hate speech words.
__label__Support	I think in the cases of newspapers, the hateful comments can be removed before print. If it's an online platform then said user can be shadowed	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered. This is a democratic world and  people have a right to have an opinion in what becomes available to them
__label__Attack	The trouble with the online newspapers/media is they already show bias to certain stories depending on where you read. Comment sections can be useful for discussion but it's a shame that not all people use them in the best way.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	Not an issue that impacts on my life	The state of the health service is one of the biggest problems we have, and the NHS one of our biggest assets (despite the problems with its running). It's being dismantled and I think regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, most of the public would fight to save it.
__label__Attack	removing comments section is never going to encourage tolerance it is	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__Attack	The panel would be biased in some way no matter how much the newspaper tries to remove bias.	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide

__label__Attack	newspapers are owned and have people to answer to financially, they are also driven by clicks and advertising revenue so you could be blinded without understanding feedback on a topic from the public	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section.

__label__Attack	People will add their opinions anyway, whether they are necessary or not	not all stories need people to add their opinions sothat should ease the pressure on moderators
__label__Support	newspapers are meant to inform, not to be discussed. The comment section is not necessary.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I really think this could work as technology has come so far and it's out there and available to be used.	By having technology that can detect hate speech so that it can be blocked before it is posted.
__label__Support	Most expensive rail travel in Europe but it's awful so I agree!	I feel something really needs to be done to help the NHS as well, it's supposed to be the pride of the nation
__label__Attack	I agree and I think because there are so many people with so many different opinions, it should be censored before it is either posted or passed through the section.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	I agree that restricting comments would limit hate speech	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.

__label__Attack	This seems like agreat idea.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	this is a great way to monitor the section	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.

__label__Support	It would discourage racism/xenophobia	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Absolutely agree, everything is in ruin	We need to get rid of sunak
__label__Support	Passing hateful speeches is not basic right of freedom of speech, rather you are checking how peoples comment could affect society. People need to be banned and removed from passing those comments to put positive energy on media platforms.	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech. But the question still remains, when is it just a hateful comment and not hatred or propaganda. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression in press and other media. To some extent we dont have a right to block them from expressing their thoughts
__label__Support	Local services are falling apart.	But many people who want to work aren't able to because they have conditions that would be treatable but massive NHS backlogs have stopped them getting the help they need
__label__Attack	don't believe the lies of the establishment	definitely agree it seems as if it has been all about power for the last 14 years
__label__Support	Having a moderator and strict rules in place to ban or suspend accounts that express a form of hate speech is needed. Actually replying to that comment as the newspaper will show everyone else that it really is not okay	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.

Then you see idiots like the one to the left 'i love my diesel engine', you may well do, but people love there kids and their countries, more important
__label__Attack	No certificates should be needed to detect a hate comments, it comes to ethics and morality 	I agree with this, and I think it is made more difficult by fast-moving technology and information on what's most effective.  What is the best source(s) of information for each of the groups needing to know more? Can we build a list? 
__label__Support	I agree 	The easy way for a bot or system to analyze what could be a hate speech could be to select certain words that are usually associated to descrimination. This could be developed by studying existing comments and seeing what are the most repeated dialogues. 
__label__Attack	It is an easy programming process to do so.	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Support	I agree.  People should not stay silent through fear of someone taking offence at what they say.  How can people figure out what their viewpoints are on things if they aren't allowed to ask questions are think aloud?	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__Support	This would be an effective measure in preventing hate speech from being published.	Comment spaces should be moderated, perhaps even approved before posting.
__label__Attack	I'm not sure the answers to those questions but if more of us put pressure on policy makers to invest funds into scientific studies it would give us a greater idea, but no one seems to care or want to spend any money to improve understanding of the issue.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	hate speech online only leads to hate speech in real life. online is where much of the real world violence is incited and begins.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Yes, I would be much more likely to post, read and respond to comments on a website location that is moderated and checked before posting	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__Attack	what specifically about immigration	Rebulding the NHS, better education, taxation, honesty and integrity of elected representitives
__label__Attack	I think hate speech should be reduced as much as possible if not removed completely. This is very different from being able to provide constructive criticism which should always be allowed but there are boundaries.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	will encourage dialogue	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__Support	This is a good solution which would reduce burden on moderators, whilst also automating some of the process.	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.

__label__Support	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social  media problem as well, more like an internet problem.

__label__Attack	I disagree. In an Institute for Government webinar yesterday (24/10 https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/events/what-works-government-evidence-policy) the point was made that the public are not educated to challenge what they read in the media. It is therefore naive to assume that people would start to search around things they read in the news because 1) we are not taught how to do this and 2) there is no motive for people to begin to do this. Based on the amount of conspiracy documentaries on Netflix and YouTube it is possible that people would indeed search around what they read but for negative/conspiracy motives rather than as ground truthing.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

Get the able back to work 
__label__Attack	It's important to allow people to provide their own commentary	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__Attack	I appreciate that everyone has the right to freedom of speech but at the expense of others and being hateful?

I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__Support	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	Because hate speech causes so many unwanted consequences, this kind of liberal approach doesn't seem fruitful. Although education and counter-speech are important (https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence), we have to protect free speech while eliminating comments that incite violence.	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is  from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__Attack	i agree there has to be a balance, and freedom of speech is important for society.. but there has to be limits as to hate speech, and discrimination.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	The biggest problem that there is	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place. A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__Support	I think we can fight climate change I don't think it is too late yet.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	Agree. it also highlights the need for work to be done on hate speech/racism. Just because the comments section isn't there, doesn't mean hate speech  doesn't exist.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	"The thing is if people filter these comments, they may not work as accurate as AI. For example, they may use their own judgements to decide if something is appropriate. If we use AI, we can simply add new filters, like words or phrases, AI will filter all comments in the way we ""teach"" it."	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__Attack	this is a great way to monitor	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__Support	I tend to agree with this as the problem of entrenched ideas is increased with the echo chamber approach to collecting infrmation	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__Attack	Only allowing paying users might result in the most of the users in a comment section having the same view. For example, many young people do not use newspaper websites. Each comment section might not be diverse at all in type of users or the opinions being shared. Is an echo chamber better, equal to, or worse than a few hate comments?	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.

__label__Attack	but people who do not have you interests at heart will... not a wise move. Any selection is better than none surely>	They can't be handled any worse than how they are currently handled though.
__label__Attack	I do agree that sometimes people can mistake different opinions as hate speech but I do think it is quite easy to understand that hate speech involves language that disrespect the person you are talking to	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__Support	I agree with this comment sections can provide excellent reccomendations, for example: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/20/steely-dans-20-greatest-songs-ranked	I think that keeping a comment section is overall good as it keeps engagement but needs to be heavily moderated and regulated so it doesn't just dissolve into a lot of hate speech and grounds for radicalisation
__label__Support	We need to get out of the ECHR	I agree with all of this 
__label__Support	One of the problems with social media is the use of bots which dramatically wreak havoc with algorithms. It creates a technical imbalance and an environment that is less reality based and more echo chamber. Cleaning this up would be a huge start.	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__Attack	There are some local politicians who are definitely trustworthy, not so sure about the ones playing up to the TV cameras though!	I can understand when you know that little will change under our present voting system
__label__Attack	I agree,the should be someone who's hired to check comment and to block.Also those who bully people shoul not be allowed on the site	I think newspapers websites should have an online system  that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.

__label__Attack	People will always find other alternative ways  to express express themselves. Removing the comments section is not the solution but it would help reduce cyber bullying and make the internet a safer space for people.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I think this is a good solution for the problem. People will always find a way around it but it will eliminate at least some hateful comments.	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__Support	I agree that anybody being allowed to comment can give rise to fake news in comment sections	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Possible infringment on data	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__Support	the same as my idea	block the person who always use hate speech
__label__Support	I totattluy disagree because.....	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	I believe there are no pros to allowing hate speech	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	It may be a high-cost approach, but worthwhile for our modern society to prioritise for the good of a healthy, functioning nation.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	Brexit created the belief that problems go away if you spout B/S. Boris has a lot to answer for. 	Agreed - in some situations, people choose not to work as they would be financially worse off. That needs changing.
__label__Support	also, less caddle means less incentives for deforestation 	I believe thats an accurate solution 
__label__Attack	I disagree because it is still tolerating that intolerant people express themselves and make their opinions visible. Even if they are removed,it will take a while for that to happen and this hateful message may have already found an echo in another bigot.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	good idea, my worry is that using human paid moderators wilol push up the cost of newspaper subscriptions	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It will not give people the ability to have freedom of speech	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__Support	Comment sections seem rather pointless anyway and are just usually vessels for people to argue. There's social media nowadays to weigh in on your opinion	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Simpler communication could increase citizen engagement	Stronger action could damage EU-Israel relations
__label__Attack	Despite this there is woefully little work done to date on behaviour change and mobilisation within diverse groups, specifically in relation to ethnicity and disability	The first and simple advice often given by one of my colleagues is “thicker curtains across window and doors” . It’s short term and achievable for residents while other interventions are in planning (John Preston) 
__label__Support	I totally agree we have freedom of expression	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	This would allow comment sections to remain open while reducing hate speech.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	While I agree that hate speech is such, I feel like getting rid of the comment section would really go backwards and do more harm than good.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I think that every platform (websites, socials, etc.) have the responsability to filter and regulate what's happening on their platform.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Agree with rejoining EU but can't see how this will happen in next 5 years 	I'd like a full focus on the NHS.  Help support our healthcare professionals.  Not really bothered about immigration.
__label__Support	yes I go with the statement saying If governments around the world treat climate change collectively - the same way they treated World War 2 for instance - then is possible, no matter the cost	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	if comments spaces are removed it also lessens freedom of speech	I definitely think newspapers should remove the comment space because it encourages trolls and hate speech
__label__Attack	Some people may set up fake details / profiles in order to still post the hateful comments.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I agree. What does it help to not even try to change the advancement of climate change?	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	I agree while hate speech can be and should be monitored and removed immediately in order to reduce trauma on affected group and not to embolden other bigots. Platforms should still allow users to express opinions contrary to the creators. Peer review of reporting works well in these instances when someone goes too far - but this is also abused by with review bombing	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	That's a good speech! Unfortunately, in the real world, that doesn't work. For the most part, people that comments on newspapers websites are adults (or late teens) and already got an education. And yes, for the most part, it'll be enough, they have good values and know how to share ideas without hate. But for some, it's not the case...	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__Support	I agree, we should rethink deeply the meaning of democracy in the modern era. It is not just about voting, democracy is not just about voting and we should find ways to communicate this to people and policymakers	There may be challenges in balancing openness with security and privacy concerns
__label__Attack	AI algorithms are frequently biased. There's still a long way to go before reliable AI algorithms are developed. Until then, using AI algorithms alone to moderate the comment sections of newspapers will likely lead to harmless comments removed, and, on the other hand, harmful comments published. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/04/the-role-of-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/?sh=3bf5308b579d	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__Attack	Who guards the guardians?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	I agree 100%. It's too easy to shut down all speech, just because someone gets offended by things that they do not agree with. This will only then attract the bullies and trolls who want to shout down anyone who isn't in lock step with their own narrow viewpoint.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	have profiles that are always flagged totally blocked	by just making the section smaller and have trasparency with dooing so
__label__Attack	I don't think most people would take the time to educate each other about hate speech, and I assume there will be stubborn people that are stuck in their ways and will continue to comment their hateful opinions.	Like I mentioned previously,the need for artificial intelligence is vital and like what AliceW mentioned in hjer post that people needs to be educated about hate speech which I strongly support.I also think it is everyone's responsibility to educate each other the damage hate speech has to individuals and the society at large
__label__Attack	most immigrants are doctors, lawyers, tax accountants.... the majority of people dependent on welfare are UK citizens who did not pay attention in school. 	In some ways I disagree, as renters have a right to earn money during the increased housing costs, but also I do agree that kicking people out when they decide to up the prices is horrific. It should be that an agreed price is arranged and the government do something to make sure that the need for increased rent is limited. 
__label__Attack	The right to free speech doesn't mean there are no consequences for hate speech. Tolerating hate speech is not going to make it go away.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Agree  - More pay for people who help others. Less for those who help themselves.	the NHS is something that should be funded properly and not taken into the hands of privateers, which I fear is getting very close, it will become a two tier system that means only those that can afford it will get the treatment needed.  Very scary what is likelyto happen 
__label__Support	This really need to be addressed, however i thin there are too many big lobbyists. IF we have oil and gas we should do what norway does and have a sovereign fund.  Then you see idiots like the one to the left 'i love my diesel engine', you may well do, but people love there kids and their countries, more important	investmen tin people
__label__Support	if No more trolls, political copy-pastes, or general rudeness and anger are in comments i think both sides of arguement/opinion can be heard.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Algorithms dont always get it right	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__Support	I can understand when you know that little will change under our present voting system	Pensions, Immigraation, the NHS, 
__label__Support	I appreciate the balance here.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Celebrities are a massive victim of hate speech allowing people the freedom of commenting what they want is harmful. A lot of the time articles will use these comments in other articles to back up negative opinions about others	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	without online verified profiles being mandatory i think this could be difficult to put into practise	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__Attack	Absolutely agree,and public opinion seems to favour this approach.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	Definitely need a change but not sure if Labour will be any better. Hopefully not worse!	100% agree, especially with the comment about immigrants being blamed
__label__Support	We should try and make the internet a more welcoming place.	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__Attack	Some readers will give their honest response that will assist the writers where to change or improve	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Attack	An improvement on this would be to have a flagged comment be reviewed by a moderator rather than just delete a comment altogether.	I think newspapers websites should introduce a bot that would delete automatically all posts that have too many hate words in it.
__label__Attack	We alreay pay taxes.... and don't get the good infrastructure... so it's not about money. they can raise the taxes wherever they want the issue wont resolve, as they dont want to resolve it.	Bulk of immigration problem is from illegal routes which the government has never been bold enough to take the bull by the horns. 
__label__Support	Maybe just turn the comments off what are obviously polarising matters.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	I agree completely. People need to be educated	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Hate speech is a form of verbal assault and should not be tolerated or encouraged.

Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	I agree that it is impossible for a human moderator to read every comment and react quick enough to an offensive comment before it has been read by other commentators.	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__Support	i agree that if people are going to use social media they need to expect hate	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__Support	Europe has more economic leverage over Israel than the US	It can help improve efficiency and sustainability of production
__label__Attack	that isn't bad, but there are some who can run circles around others with their linguistic skills	by having a system or word check that will not allow users to use words that are considered as hate speech
__label__Attack	People bypass these filters in a large number of ways that are hard to stay ahead of. A simple method for example is replacing an E with a 3 in a word so egg becomes 3gg. It is still pretty clear what is being said and bybasses the system that says I can not use that word for example.	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.

It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Much as I agree that's probably ideal as far as not requiring constant monitoring of the sort that's only really feasible for a relatively small amount of newer articles, the kind of technology for properly filtering such things isn't quite there yet, beyond simply checking for specific language. ...and it's worth noting, even if it was, whoever writes the algorithm also decides what is worthy of being removed. Being able to cull commentary automatically this way is potentially even more damaging if your concern is freedom of speech.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that there is no need for comment sections under newspaper articles when most of the comments end up being a form of hate speech.

__label__Support	Agreed! Probably can never get rid of it completely but taking steps to reducing it is 100% needed!	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

__label__Support	I agree completely. I argue that it is not up to the newspaper websites to police such discussion and that comments only harm the neutral perspective that they offer. There are plenty of other discussion platforms  #like Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter, where such discussions could take place and where other users have the power to moderate the community opinion themselves.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others. 	Research and twenty one years experience suggests that there is little doubt that many people from different parts of civil society feel disconnected or excluded from environmental action and discussion at just the time when the environmental sector is working to develop and expand engagement.

__label__Attack	I have yet to see a comments section that was in any way constructive. I could go onto MSN any day and if I were to read a news story, in particular any where a young person has died from anything related to drugs or knives, and there is zero concern for the person or their family, only criticism and sometimes blatant racism. I wish people were as you describe, but I have yet to see any evidence of it.	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__Attack	i dont agree, it is too controlling , there needs to be a middle ground of moderating	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__Support	I agree that we, as humans, can adapt to the situation as best as possible. But we can also take small steps towards change. The situation doesn't have to be impossible.

__label__Attack	It can be difficult to automate this monitoring	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__Support	Removing the comments section won't make much difference as people just migrate to different platforms to continue posting hate speech, the EU setup a code of conduct for countering illegal hate speech, https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en, this has had an effect on hate speech online and is something that newspapers can be part of if they want to help stop hate speech being posted by users responding to online articles.	Removing the comment section will not be effective since there will not be any interactions between readers.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	The idea of using AI algorithms to combat hate speech is an attractive one. However, using experience of Facebook, it's clear that AI systems are still not advanced enough to undertake this task without human oversight. Facebook often censors posts or comments unfairly because its AI algorithms doesn't understand the context. In short, I don't believe we can get away without using humans to check the flagged comments at least.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I don't think it will make a difference. People will comment elsewhere. Fake news spreads more rapidly on social media than from the comments section of a newspaper website. I think the whole issue is being over thought.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Brexit was clearly a disaster	I agree with the NHS.  It needs some serious money put into it.
__label__Support	I agree with this idea. It feels like the easiest one to apply or at least to start with.

Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__Attack	there is a distinction between comments that are made directly in a discriminative way and comments that create a dialogue. 	I think sometimes retrofit can work in sympathy with historic elements of architecture, and actually result in the highlighting of period features.  If I can dig it out, there was a good case-study of a church that had been fundraising for a new roof. In the end, due to the roof not being visible from the highway, or easily from ground-level, they were able to install solar PV panels to effectively cover the damaged roof with a secondary, waterproof layer - with clear benefits of electricity generation as well as original goal of fixing leaks... 
__label__Attack	This dos seem a little harsh,  a little negativity will push you to greatness. I am for moderation.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Support	This would work well with non-bias moderators	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__Attack	i dont believe eliminating the space for readers comments is the right thing, readers should be allowed to comment and moderators can be used to reduce harmful/hateful speech	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Creates a platform for fake news	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Support	The problem with this is that the moderator themselves often have an agenda.	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website
__label__Attack	not difficult, would say need more work and maybe more money spent in discovering something new	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__Support	This is definitely a major concern.

__label__Attack	The reason why I disagree is because removing the comment sections unable readers from expressing their view and opinions on certain topics covered in the newspaper.	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.

__label__Support	I agree and also that some comment may not have been posed to upset/hurt, but can do, so educating people in how to respond would be a good thing.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	Same here, but I have decided for change, and my postal vote has gone in!	Close the tax loop holes and put more resource into tackling tax avoidance/evasion
__label__Attack	Don't agree with tactical voting. It is a dishonest vote as you are not voting for who you really want.	I am sad to say that, following the information on the media, politicians seem to be less than 100% reliable.
__label__Support	I like this idea - there could also be a warning system for those reading the comments, if something does get published that possibly shouldn't have. A warning stating that the following comment may be offensive and contain hate speech.	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__Attack	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.	Cost of upgrades, which are always higher for properties in a heritage setting, are unaffordable for individual owners in low wage, low property value areas.

__label__Support	that is true the developers hate to filter, using mods and bots to detect the hate speech	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.

__label__Attack	Great! I have a similar approach	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Support	It is truly dire, I think that's why we are here, to test it, not to talk about the election.	I am not sure if this will happen 
__label__Support	I agree, education is the best way in stopping this in the future https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/preventive-role-of-education	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Support	I agree! I think restricting comment sections won't stop harmful opinions, they will just be posted elsewhere. But creating a safer environment for these discussions would be good	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__Support	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this. Privatisation has been a huge mistake 	They have run this country into the ground in my opinion, cut police and NHS funding, crime rates have gone up, illegal immigration at an all time high, cost of living crisis.

One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	Democracy dies in darkness. Commentary on news was made to spark debate and deeper thought about new events. I feel something is lost if we remove this feature from news articles.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Current frameworks may be inadequate for addressing complex, systemic challenges	We need to update our conceptual frameworks and thinking patterns about food systems
__label__Attack	How will we stop/prevent people from being aggressive with their opinion though particularly if they find a news story disagreeable?	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	Sometimes people do need to be censored, especially when it comes to hate speech because sometimes those words become actions and people get assaulted in real life. Words spoken online sometimes rally people together to take action (for example what happened in the United States when people stormed the Capitol because of fake news spreading online about the voting results being fraudulent https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/election-misinformation-helped-fuel-jan-6-capitol-attack-now-climate-misinformation-threatens-planet/ )	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I think if the hateful users find other places to share their opinions, they might find similar minded people and create a hateful community that might do more harm than just the individuals	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__Attack	"The problem is some form of censorship would be required for writers if the definition of ""hate speech"" isn't universally agreed. Perhaps a trigger warning for readers of a sensitive disposition could be given at the start of an article. Different countries have different laws or understandings of hate speech. Will comments from different countries have to be blocked?"	Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__Support	True, we need to increase technology to deal with this problem.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	Brexit was a disaster!	Conservative approach - manufacture problems, then profit from selling the solutions. 
__label__Attack	There are equal rights, just some who don't want to work as hard as others 	lets stop the madness of climate change restrictions.. I love my DIESEL engine :) 
__label__Support	Yes I don't know why they can't just tell the truth! It's not like the UK public expect them to to everything but what's the point in making promises to win the election and then not keeping to any of their promises?	"perhaps we need PR and making it legal to vote , this means having ""none of the above"" option.      It works in other countries.  I have met opel who do not bother to vote   "
__label__Support	This may work	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Support	By holding them liabile it will remove negativity on the platform.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	People should be able to read things they don't like or agree with.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	agree with this totally, and I think that was my opinion earlier	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__Attack	I think if saying something out loud in a public place would get you arrested, you should not be allowed to type it online.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	This are very important issues to me too 	potholes and big Oil & gas corporations being taxed huge profits to tackle their green house gases 
__label__Attack	In addition to using algorithms, technology can be used to eliminate comments that involve hate speech for reader inclusivity. I definitely agree to this. Everyone has a freedom of speech, but it should infringe the rights of others too.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	That was COP25, I believe in this discussion we are trying to focus on COP26	I have heard that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference Closes with Limited Ambition
__label__Support	Totally agree with your point on crimes, immigration less so as I believe the lack of legal immigration routes has led to an influx in illegal. It's significantly caused by the Tories's inability to handle foreign policy and immigration	When will the government pension shceme be scrapped?
__label__Support	yes. the website can simply have words that are not accepted in the comments. this can minimize or eliminate hate speech altogether	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__Support	Compelling argument	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Discussions helps to deepen learning, to remove it completely would hinder what you could know but they need to be monitored for sure. Hate speech is not okay.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree it is an individual's responsiblity to choose their words carefully, and if they don't then their comments, or eventually if they persist, their accounts should be removed.	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__Attack	Do you believe that people can actually be controlled. The audience will alway find a way to spread hate.	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__Attack	You should always use your vote, even if it's a tactical vote.	The NHS needs sorting out
__label__Attack	I completely agree with you on this, cause this has been really heavy on my paying the heavy bills on housing   	Information alone is not enough without education on how to use it
__label__Attack	readers should be able to have their say	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Good idea but an education policy would take time to be effective	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Not it's not, but I'd rather take a gamble on the other option than vote in who have shown themselves to be awful for the past 14 years	Financial education to be taught in schools!!!!
__label__Support	This is the issue that made me most tempted to switch from Labour to Green. I will probably still vote Labour while holding my nose as things currently stand unfortunately.	Not having a billionaire for a Prime Minister will be a good first step 
__label__Support	Regularly scheduled mini lockdowns are a possible part of a solution. More ideas like these need to be formulated and multiple avenues have to be explored and implemented. It's not about one solution or one quick fix -- it's going to be about a number of different plans and programs working together to a unified solution made up of many segments.	Agree, bio-fuels is not a clean form of energy. Rich countries support it as a cheap form of energy, yet it has a high CO2 profile 
__label__Attack	I agree	haters may be removed is the system is able to identify them...so I think comment space can be kept but regulated 
__label__Attack	Removing all comments as a blanket measure is appropriate as it moves the conversations to other spaces. Newspapers should be for news, objective, they are no place for opinions	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	writers will not know how the reader feels	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	people naturally get angry so its difficult to reduce hate speech without any group being offended to some distinction	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	NHS is main priority for me too.	We really need to do much more here. But I feel things like solar farms are not the way, the batteries leak into water supplies etc, we need to look at new green ways 
__label__Support	I agree with this definitely. Let people comment but keep an eye on what people are doing by introducing moderators.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
