__label__Attack	Drones are being used in many industries. They go to places where it is difficult for humans to go. For example, they can be used to deliver medicines quickly in hilly regions. Drones can be used to deliver food in times of natural calamities. Not just delivering food, using drones, rescue teams can find people that are stuck and can save them. So, drones can save lives.

__label__Support	More population causes a burden on the government and hence it will be difficult to ensure the quality of life for all.	We should fight against urbanization
__label__Support	Due to high demand, land prices, housing prices, and rents will increase drastically. Not everyone can afford the prices. Those who can afford to have to spend a large part of their income on housing. The people who cannot afford to rent in urban areas are forced to live in slums with substandard housing and poor sanitation facilities, which negatively affects the health of people living there.	We should fight against urbanization
__label__Support	NGOs are often America's way of interfering in European elections. NGOs must be policed more vigilantly to prevent America from interfering in our elections.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
__label__Support	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing. Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight. Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__Support	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.	We should have legal migration channels.

__label__Support	No person should really earn an income from owning land itself, because it is not the result of human labor. Planet Earth is the common inheritance of humanity, why should any human have the right to take a piece of ground and demand payment from someone else for the privilege of using it? The land exists independently of the land owner.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__Support	A land tax would eliminate land speculation because the increase in ground rent would go away in tax.	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__Attack	Space mining may be neat science fiction, but I doubt it could ever become a commercially feasible activity. Aside from the environmental impact of launching vehicles into space, moving the mined materials to Earth would pose its own challenges. Entry into the atmosphere and arrival on Earth is dangerous. Having thousands of tons of mined matter go through this process seems destined to end up with frequent disasters.	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
__label__Support	In the hope of becoming rich, many people are burning money to buy overhyped digital art. Many will lose money when people lose interest in buying these NFTs. Some people are saying that NFTs are a bubble that is going to burst.	We should ban NFTs
__label__Attack	NFTs help artists sell their paintings, music, etc. for a good amount of money, which may not be possible before NFTs.	We should ban NFTs
__label__Support	Whenever an NFT was sold or bought, the transaction consumes lots of electricity. This huge energy consumption is a serious issue because we are already fighting against climate change.	We should ban NFTs
__label__Support	Hackers are stealing NFTs. And they are also stealing cryptocurrencies by sending malicious NFTs. Recently, hackers stole $150k worth of crypto from Twitch co-founder’s Fractal NFT project.	We should ban NFTs
__label__Attack	Instead of banning anything, we should create better alternatives. When the high-speed rail line (320 km/h) between Strasbourg and Paris was opened, the number of flights between Stuttgart and Paris dropped dramatically, due to decreasing demand.	We should ban domestic air traffic
__label__Attack	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__Attack	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__Support	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.	We should end illegal pushbacks.

__label__Support	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__Support	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research. This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic. These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
__label__Support	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.	We should criminalize the export of waste
__label__Support	Waste produces negative environmental impacts in the recipient state.	We should criminalize the export of waste
__label__Support	Exported trash is burning for months suffocating local people and wildlife.	We should criminalize the export of waste

__label__Support	Children are made to work in industries with hazardous chemicals, and machines under harsh weather conditions, resulting in physical casualties and many severe diseases.	India needs to address the issue of child labor
__label__Support	Due to a lack of education and proper guidance, they get influenced by criminals and take shortcuts to become rich, and end up committing crimes at a tender age. The rates of juvenile crime cases are increasing day by day in India.	India needs to address the issue of child labor
__label__Support	The number of harassment and child abuse cases has drastically increased in the last few years most of them are sexual abuse cases occurring with girls and boys aged below 15.	India needs to address the issue of child labor
__label__Support	Childhood is the most important phase for the development of physical and emotional abilities. The problem of child labor is stealing childhood from many children. Mere making laws to prevent it doesn’t solve the problem. Implementation of the laws on a war footing is needed.	India needs to address the issue of child labor
__label__Attack	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Support	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Support	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Attack	Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature. Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose. Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Attack	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now.	We should embrace the future of GMO
__label__Support	Feeding or dressing man is no longer an acceptable excuse with the state of knowledge of the “modern” world.	We should end animal abuse
__label__Support	There is little or no educational, conservational, research, or economic benefit derived from wild animals in traditional circuses that might justify their use and the loss of their ability to behave naturally as wild animals.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Support	In circuses, wild animals in circuses are destined to a life of physical abuse and mental torture.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Support	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Support	Circuses are traveling entertainment services moving around Europe, and performing wild animals are transported across Member States, where circuses pose a severe public safety threat.	We should ban animals in circuses
__label__Attack	As women face violence because of their gender, they need special laws to protect them. But, in general, men do not face physical harassment just because of their gender.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Attack	In India, it is very difficult for women to go to police stations to report crimes against them. Men’s commission may further deter them from approaching courts.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	If a woman is a victim of any sort of harassment and is in a distress, society will more likely to help her. But the same is not true for men. If a man is a victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment, there is no single government entity he can approach to. Moreover, society may make fun of him for being weak. This is the reason married men are twice likely to commit suicide when compared to married women. To address these gender stereotypes and discrimination, there is a need for 'National commission for Men'.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	As per the 2011 census, India has a 51.47% male population. India has a 'Ministry for women & child development', but none of the government entities is working on men’s rights. As India is a democratic country, it is unfair to neglect people based on their gender.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	With better and more stringent mechanisms and laws in place to deal with sexual harassment, rape cases, and domestic violence cases, unfortunately, there have been instances of misuse of the laws to cause harm to innocent men. Setting up a Ministry of Men would at least give such men a chance to make their case. This, in no way, is meant to undermine the case for the protection of women.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	It has been observed that in countries where the sex ratio is skewed against women, crimes against women increase drastically. As can be easily seen in India, crimes against women have been on the rise. Most horrific of all, crimes against minor girls have increased drastically since 2012. This paints a very grim picture of our society as a whole. The highest GDP growth rate amounts to nothing if our society itself is corrupted to the extent that it is right now. India has been a patriarchal society for centuries. To make a shift to an egalitarian society for women in every aspect of life, Indian men need to be re-educated and rehabilitated with the new norms.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
__label__Support	Drug addiction is a menace that has plagued Indian youth in recent years. The majority of drug addicts are males. A ministry of men can help solve the problem of why capable male youth of the country are resorting to such self-destructive activities.	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India

__label__Support	As per Article 370, people of other regions cannot buy land or settle in Jammu & Kashmir. This is acting against the development of the region. By abolishing article 370, teachers, doctors, and other professionals can settle there bringing better facilities.

__label__Attack	We were champions of hockey even when we were not independent. We have won Olympic 8 gold medals in Hockey, the highest in any sport. We had a glorious past, and we should work towards restoring it. Making cricket a national game may overshadow hockey.	Cricket should be declared the national game of India
__label__Support	Apart from the raw passion, the money and fame that follows are blinding. Unlike other players of other sports, the cricketers even at the junior levels earn handsomely, which is also a motivating factor that this game ensures financial security provided you play well.	Cricket should be declared the national game of India
__label__Support	India has been performing outstandingly well in cricket for the past 20 years or so. It is the most popular sport in India. Children are madly passionate about it, people are deeply involved in the game, and there is a cricket critic in every Indian house. The BCCI has been successful in brilliantly marketing and encouraging the game as well. BCCI is the richest cricket board in the world and the richest sports controlling authority in India. No sports authority has managed their game so well in India as compared to BCCI. We have won 3 World Cups, 2 Champion Trophies, and many more prestigious tournaments.	Cricket should be declared the national game of India
__label__Attack	Cricket basically originated in England and gained popularity in colonial countries as the English masters used to play. The fine Englishmen used to bat all day and the tiring bowling work was done by the locals of the colonies. This game is a sign of the presence of colonialism.

__label__Support	All of Europe has to pay income tax & VAT, except for the Eurocrats. In Belgium, you have to pay 50 % of your salary to the state, unless you work directly for the EU. Is this fair? No, of course not! It is time to make Europe fairer in a very practical and direct way, by abolishing tax exemptions for European politicians and staff.	We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians
__label__Support	It is absolutely ridiculous to be spending money on these climate disastrous practices. The EU is nowhere close to keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement and is still funding unsustainable practices left and right.	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__Support	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model.	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__Attack	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.' The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
__label__Attack	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions. We have the perfectly fine EU Treaties as the foundational documents of the EU. They must be followed to the letter.	We should create a common constitution
__label__Support	Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Attack	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Support	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Support	Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again.	We should abolish unanimity voting
__label__Attack	We should focus more on human welfare. Currently, waste sorting and recycling are degrading human exploitation in sweatshops.	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__Support	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels.	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__Support	giving nuclear energy a green label will encourage the flow of financial resources across the EU toward environmentally sustainable activities	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__Support	Nuclear energy can be considered sustainable because it is cheap and can be predicted for decades, and the price of power produced by nuclear power plants is not affected by changes in the price of natural gas or other energy carriers.	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__Support	Nuclear energy use helps to avoid the release of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants every year, which contribute to the development of acid rain, smog, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__Attack	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps?	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Attack	If Europe is going to have concentration camps again, they should be in Europe, in plain sight, for everyone to see.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Attack	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Attack	Setting up inhumane camps by bribing local warlords is not the right way.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Support	Agree. If the asylum seekers don't have to cross the Mediterranean to apply for it less of them will die trying and less human trafficking will take place.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Support	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Support	Good idea. These camps can be managed by the UN. The EU can send illegal immigrants to these camps. So they will not be on EU soil. From the camps they still can apply for asylum.	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
__label__Support	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop, With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today.	We should consider Russian interests in the EU policy.

__label__Support	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__Support	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability. It only requires a person's higher capacity to be compassionate, respectful and most of all dedicated to our environment's needs. Who wouldn't want such qualities to become our society's norm?	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__Support	Even if you believe you are unable to follow a plant-based lifestyle you must appreciate the effectiveness and dedication to the environment of those individuals who do.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__Support	There is no reason other than egotism to be against such a proposal.	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources

__label__Support	Today we live in a system where our public healthcare system is organized on a for-profit healthcare system, where we develop knowledge through taxpayer institutions and then let companies patent this knowledge for profit this has to change, we shouldn't let the greed of capitalists extort us, the EU should work to DISMANTLE all patents and make healthcare issues for all. The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now.	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__Attack	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease.

__label__Support	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council.

This is not a democratic way. The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election.	We should abolish the European Council
__label__Support	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.	We should abolish the European Council

__label__Support	Though our constitution guarantees equal rights to women in all aspects, the mentality of people didn’t change. There have been several cases of rapes, domestic violence, dowry, acid attacks, etc. that led to the formation of several strict laws for women's safety. In 2011, India was ranked as the fourth most dangerous country for women in the world (in 2018 India was ranked the most dangerous country for women) and worst among the G20 nations when it comes to women's security.

__label__Support	The question of economic feasibility is being raised as the project is too costly at Rs. 1.5 lakh crores.

So, by enforcing legal measures such as compulsory vaccination, we can achieve 100% vaccination. The government can help them in dealing with their fears by keeping them for a longer time in vaccination centers while having a medical team by their side.	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
__label__Support	If the world did not achieve 100% vaccination, a lot of new variants will be created. So, it is important to vaccinate all to reduce the possibility of new strains.	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
__label__Attack	Many people are not taking vaccination due to the rumors that are being spread by anti-vaxxers using social media. Taking action against these rumor creators is much better for improving the vaccination rate rather than enforcing compulsory vaccination.	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
__label__Attack	Widespread awareness campaigns involving local people can help in overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Innovative and creative advertisements can encourage people to take the vaccination. These methods will be much more effective than legal measures.	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory

__label__Attack	No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly. Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this.

__label__Support	Print media is more trustworthy because once the news is published, it cannot be modified or deleted. Whereas in digital media, we can modify or delete the contents.

__label__Attack	It is not eco-friendly, since print media requires paper that is harvested from trees.	We should subsidize print media
__label__Attack	Print media is just one-way communication. It gives information to the public, but consumers cannot share their opinions. Even though some newspapers publish readers’ mails, it is not user-friendly.	We should subsidize print media

__label__Attack	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all! Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world. Radioactive rain - cool ;-)	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__Attack	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__Support	Members should adopt measures to end unpaid Internships causes they are a form of exploitation of young people.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__Attack	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__Attack	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
__label__Attack	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. It is only transitional. We have good conditions for sustainable green energy (solar, wind, hydro, bio-methane and their combinations).	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy

__label__Attack	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it. We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control. I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands.
__label__Attack	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands.

__label__Support	This is the only way that European values and democracies can survive the challenges ahead of us.

__label__Attack	Taking unilateral decisions is sometimes important because dialogue and all the other ways did not work till now.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Attack	Bifurcation can result in better governance and more efficient administration. It can also help in tackling terrorism.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Support	This may set as a bad example for the succeeding governments. Downgrading the status of a state to union territory can be taken as a precedent. For example, If the state government is ruled by a different party from the center, and if the center wants to take control of the state, this incident can be shown as an example to do so.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Support	This step may be used by separatists to influence youngsters in acting against the Indian government.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Attack	Moreover, tourism and film shootings faced obstacles due to the militancy in J&K. Now as Ladakh is a separate union territory, it can boost its economy.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Support	Bifurcation of Jammu & Kashmir was done without consulting the people and local leaders of the state. Moreover, there was a blackout of communication channels and media, so they had no possibility of expressing their views. This sends a wrong message to the people and is against the democratic principles of India. It is also against the federal principles, which guarantees rights to states. Moreover, on the same day, Article 370 was revoked, so this may make local people feel like they have no say in the decisions that impact them.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Support	Further division of Ladakh into 2 districts – Leh and Kargil on a religious basis is facing criticism from the local people. This move could have been avoided to preserve unity.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good
__label__Attack	When Jammu&Kashmir were one state, Ladakh felt alienated. Its ecological and cultural uniqueness was not given enough importance and was often neglected because the culture of Ladakh and J&K are very different. Thereby people of Ladakh are demanding bifurcation for a long time. Ladakh’s local leaders feel that their region was politically neglected by the administration at J&K. So, bifurcating is a good decision.	The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir brought more harm than good

We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__Support	Europe should choose a common language. This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language.	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language
__label__Attack	We have made huge strides in ending sex-based discrimination in Europe. I think we can say that - but for a few details - this issue has been resolved. 'Gender' is a political concept made out of whole cloth. One is certainly free to imagine oneself to be a pink unicorn, but in the eyes of the law and society, he or she remains a man or a woman.	We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender

__label__Support	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers. The EU is a necessity that is comparable with the worker's unions in the 1800 industrialization. Therefore the EU has to decide what role it wants to play in this coming world order.	We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world
__label__Support	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__Support	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__Support	If an employee receives part of his salary in the form of car and petrol, he will naturally use it more than he would otherwise, be less inclined to explore alternative ways of transport and opt for a bigger more polluting vehicle than what he really needs.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees

__label__Support	Yes. This will prevent the probability of danger that hate speech usually causes.	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.

__label__Attack	It is important to actually define what hate speech is before an agreed education policy can be enacted.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Support	If everyone is honest about what they saw.	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Support	I agree with this argument. It is important to balance the right to freedom of speech against the need to reduce hate speech.	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__Attack	I strongly agree with your opinion, however the reader comments need to be respect as a platform despite people having the right to freedom of speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	People will say whatever they want even mean things and say it is free speech.People should learn to be kind to others without using free speech as an excuse	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not.

I would contend that the basis of any energy strategy, and particularly one for a listed asset, must be challenging the building occupiers expectations and requirements.

__label__Support	Freedom of speech is important but it's important we use it in the correct way. If what we are saying results in bullying then that should be shutdown.

__label__Support	Flagging comments does work with limited effectiveness, however, like with social media, you will always invite people who want to censor anything they disagree with. Those individuals try to utilize flagging and reporting, ase  a tool to bully those that they do not agree with. That is not an effective way to deal with actual hate speech.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	it would take a lot of time before the news are released	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	I disagree, the person commenting can do so in a manner that isn't hateful. Only people who choose hate as their platform in getting their opinion across will be blocked. Hopefully these people rethink their approach and try again in a different manner	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view.  We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__Support	The NHS needs a large amount of investment and the staffing adjusted to take into account long waiting lists and staff shortages and this will lead to more immigration . in light of the wars around the world defence has to be a big issue that needs sorting.	potholes and big Oil & gas corporations being taxed huge profits to tackle their green house gases 
__label__Attack	I think people should have the right to comment but should do so respectfully.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I don't think that simply mitigating the problem should be our focus. 	If people can start separating strategies to help the earth and politics, I would be more apt to believe it.   An example is the new green deal that is being proposed in the US.  When you read it, a majority is about socialist policies and overreach of the government and is not relevant in anyway to climate change.  Other agreements let large polluters like China and India off the hook while expecting a disproportionate amount from the US.   This makes me very cynical about the overall agenda behind it.
__label__Support	Is there a country that you think does immigration well and that we should model? 	Rebulding the NHS, better education, taxation, honesty and integrity of elected representitives
__label__Support	Cost of living because that government has allowed and enabled profiteering by coorporations and private entities e.g. energy sector 	it is not something i considered for voting tbh
__label__Attack	The Biden administration has not taken concrete actions to support peace	Communication with consumers is challenging due to activist voices dominating the discourse
__label__Attack	what do you mean?	agreed - though given statements on all three of these issues I've got little faith in either of the two main parties. 
__label__Support	Id say the tax bracket could change - the 12,570 has been frozen for years and as a minim wage earner I do struggle myself and if it wasnt for my partner I could not afford living by myself depsite workung 40+ hour weeks in a high technical job (civil engineering) 	immigration is nice but dont u think that will decrease budget for the rest of the country while increasing population and NHS care 
__label__Attack	I agree with you on the fact the media controlling what we view can be untrustworthy and outright terrifying, however in the view of hate speech and affecting the health of authors and committed readers mentally factors in more greatly than this, in my personal opinion.	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__Support	I agree that the establishment will have too much power, and not be fairly represented if fair negative opinions are seen as hate speech	"some people ""troll"" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion. Any attempts at calling something ""hate speech"" will be only about stopping anything that goes against the narratives of the rich establishment."
__label__Support	Most self serving govt I have ever seen and I am 60	Health, housing, immigration
__label__Attack	Who gets to determine what exactly IS hate speech? It's a slippery slope that eventual will deem everything hate speech.	Hate speech is everywhere, not just in the newspaper
__label__Support	This is exactly true.	It's lack of investment in training. We can't keep letting our country poach other people's trained doctors and nurses to save money.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is called hate speech for a reason. ALso it is not protected under the guise of freedom of speech. Not forgetting that with every right theres subsequent responsibilities	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__Attack	I think that having these echo chambers just perpetuates what may be a cognitive dissonance, you may not necessarily feel a certain way but a comment you put out may have be interpreted one way and subsequent comments would reinforce that viewpoint in a polarised echo chamber. This website explains it nicely and uses racisms as an example of how cognitive dissonance perpetuates racist behaviour. https://www.reallifepsych.com/single-post/2017/08/16/the-psychology-of-cognitive-dissonance-and-racism	"The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of ""cognitive dissonance"" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context."
__label__Support	very much agree on cost of living issues!	well, lets get this started. Cost of living, energy costs and the terrible state of the NHS
__label__Support	I think that would be good	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__Attack	Even if it is getting harder we have to at least try.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	Potentially reduces correction or dissenting information on the article	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	All we can do is reduce our impact but not reverse it.Unfortunately is statistically inevitable 	"For some people, ""Man made climate change"" begs the question. While I might not be one of them, I'll say assuming climate change is indeed man made, all we can do is reduce our greenhouse gas generation. This will require the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to be prioritized more than it currently is. "
__label__Attack	"But should we then allow ""freedom of speech"" to propagate into free hate speech for anyone to use on the platform. Only through learning and understanding that there are rules and responsibilities can one start removing forms of hate speech. There should be regulations put in place for offenders."	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I've really been annoyed at the government making promises just to get us to vote for them but they haven't done anything honest while they've been in power	Student loans are another big issue. We are saddling our children with debt as Universities are entering a financial crisis of tgheir own
__label__Support	I agree with Andrew. It can also be a form of bullying and those most likely to be affected are the more vulnerable people in society.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	"Define aggressive, some reddit subs ban gendered language which is over moderation in my opinion when you look at the content of a word not the technical definition of it sometimes. Like saying ""I'm having a bitch of a time"" vs ""you're a bitch""."	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	the comment section can actually be a platform for bullying other people and hence it is a solution . removing it will limit publication of the hate speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	Newspaper articles are for delivering news not for people's opinion.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Support	Verification of identity is a useful suggestion as users may be more scared of consequences if they can be identified from their comments.	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	This article (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512786.2013.859838?casa_token=V_anYAQrBCIAAAAA%3A8IhQZy8qfCjnjwaIRbnec33KKLtJ-bMtB2hlHbj2F-zaeHbi--55gbSq8lsDIkCmhmSQE1khpVZRD9M) states that comments are integral to keeping news fresh and discussed. Having news discussed by people is what sparks change in our society, so they are still important and probably shouldn't be removed!	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__Attack	Also it's not about restricting any form of hate speech, we also need to be reminded that our opinions can't be the only right one. Hate speech is hate, and a crime against who ever is being undermined	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__Attack	This article summarises it well  https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I agree that the sooner we act the better. Every day climate change grows.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	An algorithm in itself can be bias and discrimatory as proven by studies, it also may not take into consideration different languages	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Discriminatory words could be automatically blocked which will certainly reduce hate speech to some extent	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__Attack	This could be considered less democratic and biased only showing positive comments. https://www.proquest.com/openview/87a0114d041605296b4dd4dd32634b4d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750	All the posts should be checked before being posted and verified by some sort of AI. Hate speech could affect a person's livelihood and mental state
__label__Support	i agree with this as it will be moderated then	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__Attack	Removing comment speech will not allow people to express their feelings	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__Attack	There is clear evidence of the efficacy of different moderation practices because these have been used on various sites for years now.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Current regulations are insufficient to address the challenges posed by social media and AI	There is a need for better regulation and control of social media and AI

__label__Support	indeed	make it so
__label__Support	true that 	Reform institutions to better incorporate citizen input
__label__Attack	There is nothing wrong with a healthy discussion from opposing sides of an argument. The only issue is when people are posting hate speech. What is hate speech needs to be clearly understood https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	The comments section may be removed on especially conflicting topics/conversations.
__label__Attack	However, it might also discourage people from leaving comments generally as it is quite difficult to leave a response and not many people would go through that much effort to say something, which there is a risk of being personally identified as well.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	No hate speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	We need people in the UK to actually be helped back into work to realise they can earn more money by working than on benefits. There are enough people to make a difference without so many immigrants.	NHS, Housing Crisis, Cost of Living
__label__Support	It could help address the perceived disconnect between citizens and institutions	Jerusalem is the key issue in resolving the conflict
__label__Support	I agree - inflation rates are also going up much faster than our salaries. It feels like a lot of us are stuck in quicksand. 	Yes, I agree that the rich really need taxing, the Greens have it right there
__label__Attack	This isnt a freedom of speech issue. That is only in relation to the govt not curtailing free speech. A private company... newspaper, has no obligation to allow you to freely air your views.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	It also promotes cyberbullying ,saying it is a free speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I want to hear everyones opinion	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy 
__label__Support	Scientists have been saying this many years now, it seems people just want to ignore the problems and hope it will go away on its own!	The rising temperature causes all the problems .The human cause of climate change is not disputed by any scientific body
__label__Support	I agree. Considering much of this hate speech comes from bots it is impossible to keep up with it. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221104749	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.
__label__Attack	It's actually not : https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech	The lines between hate speech and freedom of speecg and expression and constantly getting blurred further and further.
__label__Attack	Moderator cannot always be reliable	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__Support	But the prisons are full! 	Same although i think there will always be element of them being in it for themselves 
__label__Attack	I don't believe this really. There are scientists who definitely dispute that humans are a cause of climate change. They also cite many types of weather patterns that cycle over and over over thousands of years that are also part of the cause.	The planet has its long, long history and doesn't need man at all. How are we sure that climate change is damaging to the planet and not just man?
__label__Support	Lots of politicians are a bit out of touch with actual reality	Foresight capabilities already exist but are not always heeded
__label__Attack	Not having a billionaire for a Prime Minister will be a good first step 	Why are we giving so much money to immigrants
__label__Attack	Not a big problem. Times change and you need to change with it and embrace the benefits. Yes, there are always going to be issues with new technologies, but you have to learn to adapt. It's not going to start taking over the world...yet.	I have always voted the same and won't change just because other parties offer pretty ideas 
__label__Attack	If journalistss are allowd hteir view and opinion which in many instances can be objecive, public should defientley be allowed to shar theirs, since ournalists are there to promot information and possibly dialogue as well	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I disagree, comments are how valid opinions are spread and change is made in the world. If there are no comments, there's no feedback.	ithink the best thing to do is to not have comments as that can really alter someone elses perception. Especially in this day and age people tend to rely on comments to then pass their own judgement and that can cause hate speech. However if the comments were to still be present i think an idea would be to mute comments that incite any type of hate.
__label__Support	Moderators are the best way to monitor the content commented combined with a system that flags censored words	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__Attack	So because of some people acting like idiots, no one can express their opinion??	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	We wont get honest feedback from the views	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__Support	No fact checking	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Increase the numbers working in HMRC on tax avoidance on high value tax payers will increase the take substantially  	"We need people in the NHS who know about the NHS not so called ""managers"" who know nothing about how the NHS works. Professionals like Drs, nurses, physios, pharmacists need to be running the NHS."
__label__Support	I agree in maybe censoring certain words but having moderators doesn't site well with me at all - it's getting to the point where only woke views are allowed to be expressed.	I think the best way is to block or censor certain words. Especially words that are synonymous with hate speech. Or better yet, have moderators in comments sections.
__label__Support	I agree with this as it is important to allow freedom of speech, however, not to the detriment of others.  There need to be acceptable guidelines.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	newspapers write viewpoint without reproach	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Agree, it is essential to monitor hate	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__Attack	when hate speech encourages violence or discrimination against any specific class of people it should be removed regardless of how inoffensive an particular individual might find it	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__Support	That is a great suggestion, that way, we all get to voice our opinions and the newspaper doesnt censor the views of their readers.	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__Attack	I would not want to see people suffering through hatespeech being allowed under the guise of freedom of speech. It is an excuse to allow hate.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I Disagree, modern software technology is capable of knowing when to filter out post being made by the public. A system can be integrated as too where if a  post achieves a certain threshold of flagged/reported tickets; there post would and can be immediately shut down.	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between  violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__Support	I tend to agree.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Other comments can also make other people sad	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__Support	definatly make the NHS great and invest what is required.	the NHS is something that should be funded properly and not taken into the hands of privateers, which I fear is getting very close, it will become a two tier system that means only those that can afford it will get the treatment needed.  Very scary what is likelyto happen 
__label__Attack	The flipside of being too visionary is needing to balance this with practical, realistic objectives and trusting your people to give open and constructive challenge to wacky ideas.	"BASED ON: ""And the major unions agree on an interoperability standard for their knowledge. Uh, for for for their consensus building platforms."", Person24 ""Yes. Because the point is that we need the.We need new ways to organize intermediaries.Because intermediaries have been dissolved by technology."", Person24 "
__label__Support	The NHS needs legal immigration, which they rely on for lots of the jobs. 	The NHS and social care, together with the dire poverty in what is supposed to be a first-world country, are priority issues which should be dealt with immediately. Climate change will take much longer to address, but we can make a start now - but cannot expect solutions within one parliamentary term.
__label__Support	I fear their true colours would come out if they were ever elected	immigration is needed who are doing the jobs here that the people dont or cannot do 
__label__Support	That is a valid point , but completely removing the comment section is not the best solution for it	No , I think that would seriously limit freedom of speech 
__label__Attack	The drawback here is that people get carried away and be verbally aggressive and use foul language which doesn't go well with most of the readers who come to view the news and some of the healthy discussions in the comment section. But, all they find it few people engaging in a verbal war which is uncalled for.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	hate speech can not be given opportunity to thrive and or be heard. it should be removed the moment it is made	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	I don't agree with arguments that removing comment sections is an attack on free speech. People have multiple platforms where they can give their opinions (social media, emails, forums, conversations etc.). Newspapers aren't required to provide yet another place for people to converse.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Then what happens to those who cannot afford to buy new vehicles and what about all the oil producing companies and businesses that will be ruined?	While trying to sort. climate change, we cannot just shut the economy off, so yes we need cheap energy
__label__Attack	How do we coordinate different stakeholders'communications? At EU level, do you feel there are such spaces to enable regular and open commuinication? 	Accountability, straight answers and some kind of punishment for not upholding what they have said. 
__label__Attack	i dont think brexit is that bad considering the two year pandemic which certainly left a bigger issue on the country as a whole and brexit was voted by democracy the majority wanted brexit 	Agreed - in some situations, people choose not to work as they would be financially worse off. That needs changing.
__label__Support	Online would be a nicer place	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__Attack	"But there is a major difference between ""  white people should die"" and ""I have a dislike towards the white race are statistically more"	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__Attack	I think what you really mean, is that reflects your opinion.  	Lots of politicians are a bit out of touch with actual reality
__label__Attack	We will just end up importing oil and gas from other countries	yes but who do you trust to do that  -   tories are being dragged to the right to face off reform idiots and labour will have to get rid of left wing momentum 
__label__Attack	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__Attack	I agree with this. The trick is how to select unbiased moderators. They have to go by a guideline	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__Support	Extreme positions often have vested interests in maintaining polarization	Focus communication efforts on the middle ground rather than extreme positions
__label__Attack	Persons can become very insensitive and offensive in the opinions given, especially in the unmoderated comments forums.	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__Attack	there is always a need for opinions	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	They rob marginalized communities of their rights by being hateful, that doesn't get priority over the actual people facing violence as a result of their shitty actions.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	In the same way that society needs to fight hate, the Internet needs to fight online hate.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Scottish Independence has had its day. How can Scotland support itself?	Agree that climate change is a massive challenge and no parties are doing enough to combat it] 
__label__Attack	I disagree, try to read everyone's idea. Some are feasible and doable	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Agreed.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	yes, I agree, need moderators,	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Support	which area of the criminal justice system would you like to see a change in? 	We need a change of government but we don't have anything solid to change it with.  I thought the Americans had it bad but we are worse 
__label__Support	I agree - ban certain words	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__Support	i agree that we still need readers comments but they should be filtered.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.

__label__Attack	Education alone is not enough, people need to want to engage	International intervention is necessary to resolve the conflict
__label__Attack	it removes the right of freedom of speech	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__Attack	I don't think we will ever fully get rid of hate speech on these platforms unfortunately however more close monitoring could decrease it, as well as sanctions for those who write the hate speech.	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article:   https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__Support	It would be ok if there were enough jobs and houses for all of the immigrants but there are not.	consideration for disabled members of society
__label__Support	I agree. Children should be taught in schools the value to expressing their opinions but also the difference in expressing and opinion and spreading hate.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree with your opinion. I think trying to find ways to moderate the comments (either automatically or by a team of humans) would be a good step. Then it's also up to the responsability of the users themselves  to have a good attitude.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Yes, I think this is the right approach	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Free speech	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__Attack	I think they hold some responsibility. But perhaps not in the way this survey is trying to determine. A free flow of ideas is necessary, which includes difficult and often cantankerous and vigorous differing opinions. It should be the responsibility of said sites to allow those types of opinions, but deal with the trolls that free and open debate often attract.	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__Attack	'Free speech' does not mean the freedom to hurt others. It isn't a licence to offend and should definitely be regulated.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Which party you think would be best for that? 	Yes it was disgusting, surely no one can trust them after that!
__label__Support	Absolutely agree with this. Newspapers will moderate comments that do not agree with their agenda.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	i dont think is right	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588
__label__Support	https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/#	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__Support	No hate speech will be written	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Too much money is spent on mental health as it is 	Scottish Independence has had its day. How can Scotland support itself?
__label__Attack	I dont agree with this as sure it counters the hate speech but that makes me question the reliability of the news article	By educating people that not everything written in newspapers is true, they should egnore some information
__label__Support	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Attack	I have always voted, even when the only choice was between two bad candidates - women died for my right to vote!	Local businesses need a boost
__label__Support	no more hate speech	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	This is partially true, but fails to account for the fact that we couldn't possibly plant enough trees to absorb all of the CO2 produced. Not enough space on the Earth. And methane.	I think that growing more trees can reverse the adverse effects of manmade climate change. Trees release fresh oxygen. Protecting the environment is the key to reversing the harmful effects of climate change. It is most important to preserve the natural environment and plant more trees. Trees release oxygen which is very good for health.
__label__Support	accountability by inputting details is a good solution	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I think the whole concept of hate speech is nonsense and completely hypocritical.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__Attack	need to have a full time moderator	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	Newspapers are biased, therefore requires readers to fact-check and challenges their articles.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	people with positive comments won't be able to share	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	This is true but with the way the news is setup, giving your own idea can lead to heated arguments which can lead to hate speech	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	This closes the possibility of healthy debate and non-hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	this outs a limit on free speech	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__Attack	If we were more careful with who we allow in the country like Australia we may not be in the financial state we are in 	Our NHS is on it's knees due to the lack of immigrants.
__label__Attack	Despite this there is woefully little work done to date on behaviour change and mobilisation within diverse groups, specifically in relation to ethnicity and disability. Work on behaviour change by Defra and others rarely looks at diversity beyond traditional income and class segmentation. Defra’s Framework and Strategy for Environmental Behaviour Change reports of over 100 pages barely mention ethnicity and make no references to disability or age. 	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down. 
__label__Support	I like this becuase	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Attack	but it discredit the news paper	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	this is good idea but some words can have more than one meaning and be used it variety of different sentences. so maybe muting words that could be discrimatory could have its limitations. i.e if you mut the word gay ( this word then count be used it postive topics about gay rights marriages etc .	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__Support	I think this is a huge problem and it's not going to go away. Much of our political class is very out of touch, and doesn't seem to want to listen to the people (regardless of political persuasion - I know a lot of politically homeless people both left and right saying they don't feel represented or their concerns listened to). I think the big parties are very bureaucratic right now. 	I agree that's why I voted for Reform
__label__Attack	Even if it is moderated, who is to say that the moderator is unbiased and won't let some comments through even though they contain hate soeech	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__Support	totally agree with you there. Not sure how it's going to pan out 	None of leaders fill me with confidence, none of them feel like strong leaders who could 'grab the bull by it horns'
__label__Support	I hope you get it! Carer's work very hard and are underpaid :( 	Let immigrants work once they are here
__label__Attack	Lockdowns are not the answer to the problem. Look how the lockdowns for the virus have caused the economy to go downhill and the depression and bad effects on the people both socially and psychologically	Agree, bio-fuels is not a clean form of energy. Rich countries support it as a cheap form of energy, yet it has a high CO2 profile 
__label__Attack	May not address fundamental systemic issues	Start reforms at local government level first
__label__Support	Agreed, it's totally problematic once you start to censor opinion over simply bad language and obvious hate speech.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Support	labour have no credible plan to stop these and human rightsd lawyers stop deportation. What about the human rights of the british people	It takes too long to train people, so import them.
__label__Attack	This removes balanced media consumption (people will get even more stuck in echo chambers!) and the idea of free-press means that there should be freedom to cross-examine	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	but what if users arent using their real information, how can the goverment implement it then?	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__Attack	"The ""they are all the same' argument is out forward by the right to discourage Labour voters. "	We need a leader who can improve the economy and grow the NHS
__label__Attack	Yes, any views shoudl be substantiated and when its obvious that it serves an agenda it should be deleted	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__Attack	Moderators are useful but they will have their own bias and we cannot guarntee that they will be impartial, thus we remain in the same position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	yes but who do we have to run the country competently? 	The whole way this country is governed need a massive overhaul, there is too much corruption, too much conflict of interest regarding our MP's, we  live in a corrupt state even more than ever when are we going to say enough is enough?
__label__Attack	If the information was moderated & hidden if deemed to be hate speech then it would still exist for the purposes of feedback but not be visible within the comments section	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__Support	I do not understand comment sections in newspapers., I wish to read the story from the author; having a vox populi of people I don't know serves no purpose to me. I agree with this poster that there are (or could be) other areas where people can place their opinions -if anybody is really interested!	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	On the other hand it also eliminates the chance of reflections or beneficial  interactions within the audience	Yes it can avoid a lot of arguments and harrasments  
__label__Attack	I also agree this is a good solution	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	If a moderator removes a comment then they should have to justify why to the contributor who may be upset at their comment being removed.	I think it is ok to remove the comments. There are other places people can go to express opinions.
__label__Attack	In my opinion freedom of speech stops when it is directed hate towards a person or a group of people. Online platforms do not have to tolerate hate speech on their platforms.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Reader comments and opinions would be very beneficial towards newspapers as these comments could start meaningful conversations and introduce new perspective to the newspapers, and help readers be able to gain more understanding of topics by reading what other people think.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Allowing those to post it anonymously gives them the okay to do it over and over again without being called out over it.	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__Support	i agree with the comment about fake news, a lot of people reading online articles are vulnerable to taking information at face value without checking whether or not there is actual evidence for this	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	none of them to seem to be honest, it seems to be a trait missing in all our politicians 	tories can be such hypocrites let alone the extreme right, their effect has been devastating all over the globe!
__label__Support	This is maybe accurate if you were a conservative voter and are not sure what to vote for, but as a leftist, the reform party offers me nothing and I dont want them anywhere near our government 	They could offer safe routes to process immigrants, but they prefer to demonise immigrants.  
__label__Support	Completely agree with this point. Address the root cause of the problem might be difficult but hate speech should be avoided at all costs.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	As a moderator in other capacities, I can tell you it takes a lot of time to manually review every single comment as they come in.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	I agree with the statement, however in this article https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea they speak about different countries laws and UN laws. The difficulties in combatting hate speech on such a universal level is there is not a solid agreement from the world on what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	But why give space for extremist conservatism?  	It is very very concerning how so many people seem to have developed short-term memory loss (for the last 5 years) when it comes to the shameful, insulting, disrespectful actions of those who are in-charge of our well-being as a nation
__label__Attack	I believe we still can. We could live amore local life	Being vegan doesn't solve the collective issue of big farming and the drastic loss of biodiversity. Carbon footprint is not the singular way to measure sustainability. 
__label__Attack	My experiences with waiting lists over the past 2 years have been good. Have needed physio and mother needed hip op, both were seen quickly. So, although i know waiting lists must be a problem for certain patients, it's not for everyone and not top of my priority list 	Yes, I agree to some extent, but I don't think you'll ever find a party that completely mirrors your values, it's important to pick a party leader you feel has integrity and principles even if you don' t necessarily agree with everything they want to achieve
__label__Attack	would definitely need a team of moderators	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I leave below a link to the study I mentioned above but was not able to attach and I am curious to hear what is others opinion. https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__Support	Party Politics need to be abolished, and all politicians need to work toward one goal which is beneficial for all and not just oppose as they are the opposition. 	I agre Brexit is a disaster but no party is going to tackle that. A referendum on rejoining the sngle maRKET? a PRIATE MEMBERS BIL MIGHT DIO IT?
__label__Support	It has been suggested that hiding comments rather than removing them is the best way forward. Commenters don't like their posts to be deleted, understandably, and often feel censored which can cause them to lash out with further offensive comments. By hiding a comment, the original poster can still see it and may not realise that it has been hidden from others which minimises upset caused to others whilst preserving the original poster's involvement. https://blog.brandbastion.com/deleting-comments-can-trigger-backlash	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	What is it about taxes you disagree with?	immigration is nice but dont u think that will decrease budget for the rest of the country while increasing population and NHS care 
__label__Support	there's always going to be some sort of criticism of freedom of speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Tailoring messages too much can lead to bland or overly triggering communication	We need to tailor communication to different audiences while maintaining a consistent core message
__label__Attack	Europe has ceded leadership on the peace process to the US	It can help improve efficiency and sustainability of production
__label__Attack	I am not sure collecting data about the person before posting will help with tracing them down and trying to re-educate them. Just blocking the post and providing a response to them saying their post is not accepted by the platform is more appropriate.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	It would still need to be moderated as the users can radicalise themselves	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	it should target the insulting and violation to individual and groups right by law or common morality  
__label__Attack	This is what most social media companies already do.  Often the AI sensors the conversation based on the pre-selected criteria without the intervention of any human moderator, because there is too much traffic for humans to monitor.  This leads to a reduction in free-speech.	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__Support	Agreed, and already planned in our hpuse, where we'd usually vote Lib Dem, but will be voting labour as they are more likely to defeat the tories, although I suspect that in this constituency that this will be a futile attempt.  	I am sad to say that, following the information on the media, politicians seem to be less than 100% reliable.
__label__Support	I agree, not anywhere near enough new housing to cope with demand	"NHS reform is important, but needs more management (it's well below levels in comparable systems), more investment, and greater integration into the social care system. ""Efficiency"" is used to imply fewer managers and admin staff, which is the opposite of what is needed. We need to free up frontline staff from needing to manage and do admin."
__label__Support	Agreed, something needs to be done about this. It's hard to get into the housing market these days, even finding a proper rental can be hard.	I agree climate change is a massive issue that needs urgent and significant action, I'm not sure the UK on it's own can have much impact though 
__label__Support	good idea if the AI was reliable	I am proposing the use of AI to manage this space
__label__Support	Allows for testing and refinement of new approaches	Start reforms at local government level first
__label__Support	Yes, and moderators ensure that comments stick to this	maybe make the comment section questions and answers about the article so comments are stictley moderated
__label__Support	True I totally agree. I think having certain policies in place before being able to comment will help. Look at this article here. on policies for internet companies https://www.americanprogress.org/article/curbing-hate-online-companies-now/	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__Support	Until more countries are committed to net zero, the little the UK can contribute is worhtless	No, thats your mum.
__label__Support	Cost of living really needs addressing, it cant continue like this	NHS, Housing Crisis, Cost of Living
__label__Support	totally agree should never be condoned	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I agree, the fact that newspaper are not able to provide a fair and safe discussion space it is not a reason to reduce free speech	No, I believe it would mute/cancel the freedom-of-speech spirit that should be contained within journalism.
__label__Support	I disagree with this. Previous to social media and comment sections, newspapers often printed responses from readers. Journalists and those giving opinion pieces should face scrutiny and feedback from readers.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Robots cannot feel empathy or anything to distinguish between a regular comment and a comment containing hate speech.	someone to check their posts before the article goes live, like a robot think
__label__Support	Immigration has gotten out of hand as has the cost of living 	NHS, Housing Crisis, Cost of Living
__label__Attack	If you don't vote, you don't really have the right to share your opinion and you aren't registered as engaging. Go and spoil your ballot if you must, but please turn up and use the British Value of Democracy to show what you think!  	Pensions, Immigraation, the NHS, 
__label__Support	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts.	I have heard that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference Closes with Limited Ambition
__label__Support	Yes, it's disgraceful	I agree this is a pressing problem that hasn't received much coverage by the main parties
__label__Support	they can monetize the paper	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	that's right, comments actually can give a lot useful information but also give all the wrong idea about particular article.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Attack	I agree. too  much damage has already been done to reverse the process and many people are unwilling to make changes to their lives that may be too much for their budget to handle	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Support	NHS needs total reform	it is not something i considered for voting tbh
__label__Attack	reflecting on this, and the use of AI - here is a statement from Facebook about monitoring hate speech and now allowing these comments on the platform: https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__Support	I have to say, this is my thoughts. I feel there is already too much of this going on, so the media oliagarchs can direct things politically.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	Indeed, because it is a tool made by human, it might have a creator bias	preferences for extreme ethical opinions 
__label__Support	Agreed, there's needs to be stronger consequences for those sharing hate speech. Those behind accounts which troll and leave horrific content should be banned and the ip address blocked.	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__Support	Persons would consider their thoughts more carefully.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Attack	Yes the costs are very high and most technologies in the [past have failed such as wind turbines etc which need electricity which cancels the effort	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more  
__label__Support	I agree, newspapers should remain impartial as much as possibe and outsource the management to a third party that most consumers of media can agree on to form that structure for defining and removing comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree, the Tory Gov has almost destroyed the NHS.  	Agreed. It must be ringfenced and protected like the triple lock on pensions with minimum guarantees 
__label__Support	setting a team aside to check for hate speech is the solution and removing it	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	"""We should encourage people to engage and enjoy living in these buildings"" (Esther Robinson Wild)"	People will become dumber. 
__label__Attack	I dont believe in censorship though. Commentary and opinions are important. We cannot say that just because some people might believe fake news we should only have one government authorized news source to protect people. People need to be less sensitive and also be aware enough to not take everything they read as being true.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	Is there a limit as to what hate speech is and what it isn't? Could someone write the rules to be overly enforcing and cause more issues and more hate?	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__Support	totally this is big	There's nothing wrong with not struggling
__label__Attack	The problem is establishing standards can be quite subjective and cause users to complain about censorship...	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Well said and well put argument here	I think I have decided who I will vote for
__label__Attack	But proper moderation is difficult to achieve.	Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.
__label__Attack	"I suppose the problem here is what a person says is their version of ""free speech"" could easily be seen in a different context by a reader.  It's a very difficult issue to get right."	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Moderation to reduce hate speech, objectively will be beneficial	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__Support	I agree. However, policies that educate people on how to deliver their speech is imperative	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	no you cant control peoples behaviours but what you also cant control is peoples abilities to have an opinion. we all need to have a say, hence what twitter is full off .	Counting on peoples's good behavior does not work. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/discussions/2020/04/13/community-rules/)
__label__Attack	People may take advantage of this.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.  
__label__Support	Hiding them could be a good idea as it allows a log of this person, and could even allow possible banning of people from the platform if they use it in a bad way	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__Attack	"There are many scientist who refute the ""climate change scenario but are silenced and not allowed to speak their beliefs. They are classified as ""conspiracy theorists"""	The planet has its long, long history and doesn't need man at all. How are we sure that climate change is damaging to the planet and not just man?
__label__Attack	This might negatively affect the person/ people in the articles.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Yes, freedom of speech is very important in this day and age.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.  The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	but if you were in charge what would your priority be?	i am not sure if this is recording what i say
__label__Support	Agree, think of CO2 emissions saved because of less caddle	I believe thats an accurate solution 
__label__Attack	The environment and immigration are just as important as the economy and the NHS. The latter two have more far reaching consequences than the first two in many respects 	we need a plan on how to improve the economy
__label__Support	I agree, this sounds like a sensible solution.	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__Support	Absolutely... and in all walks of life	Deliberative democracy will focus on co-creating new ideas with broad citizen engagement. 
__label__Support	I agree with this as it reflects my own view. Moderation is the way to go and not removal	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Agreed. And many of these potential solutions are also not successful at limiting harmful content (https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/the-facebook-upvote-and-downvote-experiment-is-a-bust.html). As long as the platform is comforming to the laws of the country then it should not have to introduce further measures to limit hate speech at the expense of preventing free and open discussion.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	This is a good idea, people might not even realize what can be classed as hateful if they've never experienced it before.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	we should be helping people to flee war torn countries rather than them risking their lives for hopes of survival 	reform the media. MSM should not be owned by foreign nationals. Make disinformation in the media an offence
__label__Support	I hope there will be prosecutions for the damage caused by the water companies due to greed, but I sadly, very much doubt there will be. 	I wish people would stop jumping on the bandwagon describing Reform as racists. Sure they have a few bad apples associated with them but have you taken the trouble to check out how many ethnic minority candidates they have standing
__label__Attack	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts!	Maybe. But all humanity should collectively act together with the lead of the big super powers. If USA and China stay out, I am afraid it would be useless
__label__Attack	This opens an avenue for hate speech to be supported by the fact that it falls under 'free speech'.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech and thought are both really important and allow people to sometimes 'clear' their minds of thoughts.	"I found this really interesting, ""Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend."" This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)"
__label__Attack	Then it would always be the medias word over the public	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	By eliminating readers comments, the readers will not be allowed to give their opinion on the topic, which infringes free-speech.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I think some people are out there to hurt so know they're commenting hateful things but know they can get away with it because there are no consequences.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	I agree, however the issue then becomes 'How do we go about finding the root cause '	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I disagree with this. I think taking away discussion completely also takes away healthy debate and positive conversation. There are ways to reduce hate comments, such as the ones outlined in this Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/04/09/10-tips-to-dealing-with-trolls/?sh=58ddf0f754f4.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Good idea as this may deter many who are considering posting hateful comments, although it may not deter the die-hards.	rules for discussion could be posted before giving the access, mention that chat moderators are following all discussions and hate speech will be removed if occures.

So finding a way to balance the correction of their hateful views while restricting their access for sharing them is the struggle.	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__Attack	I understand what you're saying in regard to rules and regulations, but people will still disregard it in order to state their opinion.	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by.

__label__Attack	It is actually the legal responsibility of the website not to publish hatespeech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I think everyone should be allowed a point of view.

In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don´t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment   
__label__Attack	I disagree and believe that other views should be respected and be allowed to be aired.  If we only read one particular newspaper then our view will become one sided, with a comments section arguing different points, then it opens us up to many other arguments.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.
__label__Support	I agree to some extent. I think there are some obvious exceptions but otherwise anytime someone disagrees they can say they find it offensive or hateful and want it removed. You can't exist in a happy thoughts only bubble	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	An issue is how can we differentiate being aggressive from being passionate. This only leaves room for newspapers to censor comments they do not like.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	Freedom of speech does not include hate speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	This would completely take away the opportunity for these people who use the comment section to post hate speech.	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__Support	That sounds good because then people know they will be held accountable for their comments.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so              Dominicis wrong
__label__Attack	What is considered free speech (and should therefor be allowed) depends heavily on the location of the platform and the user. In the US free speech is protected by law to a much greater extend than in Europe.  In the US there are only a few categories of speech not protected by the First Amendment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions), like incitement to lawless action. In Europe however free speech stops there where it infringes on someone else their rights, for example the right to not be discriminated against. Racism and targeted hate for that reason is not protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) or the national laws of many of the European countries.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	people need to be nicer online	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__Support	I would support this fully.	Newspapers could censor certain words that are deemed hateful. This could be done automatically.
__label__Support	There should be more put in place to stop all the greedy landlords buying up properties to make a fortune off those who battle to get deposits together.  	I agree climate change is a massive issue that needs urgent and significant action, I'm not sure the UK on it's own can have much impact though 
__label__Support	I agree this article https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/ speaks about hthis also. Being anon givens comfortability and lets people hide behind a false identity, taking that away would likely reduce hate speech on popular newspaper outlets out of fear of being identified. However, those with these views would likely continue on more far-right news outlets	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__Attack	working to engage those people described as disengaged or ‘hard-to-reach’ does not need to be a priority when so much else needs to be done as well. 	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.

What you are suggesting closes down public forums and debate, enhancing the impact of closed minded thinking and echo chambers in our society.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	are we listening?	hate speech is inevitable
__label__Attack	Newspapers should ensure comments are without any form of hate speech to encourage different opinions  to be shared.	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__Attack	Communication with consumers is challenging due to activist voices dominating the discourse	We need to improve communication to consumers about sustainable food choices
__label__Support	Always a question of who guards the guardians	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	This still poses an issue with what people think is acceptable.  You run the risk of people joining in as opposed to call it out.	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__Attack	"WHile the definition in general can apply to most types of hate speech, there is one flaw, which can be illustrated by the following statement: ""I don't care about your race, religion or gender.

__label__Attack	I agree that human moderators are necessary to reduce hate speech. However, I am concerned that not all websites may have the necessary financial and staffing resources to implement human moderation. I like that submitting personal information is necessary as a cost-effective means to reduce hate speech. However, I hope that the personal information will be verified, and the information will be used to promote change rather than to punish individuals. In this regard, laws may be necessary to protect online commentators.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	This statement was inspired and taken from Secretary General (https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/hate-speech-is-not-free-speech-says-secretary-general-ahead-of-human-rights-day)	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__Attack	Controversial topics should be decided on how sensitive the information or event would be to groups that are targeted with hate speech due to protected characteristics e.g race, religion, gender, sexuality etc.	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.
__label__Attack	eliminating the comment section is more like taking peoples freedoms away as people have the right to freedom of expression	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Using moderators and flagging can be abused to prevent valid comments. If the moderator doesn't like what you have written, or if there are several users who doesn't like you on the platform, they can abuse the flagging.

__label__Attack	This is a great idea as people can openly speak their opinions without worry of being attacked.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
