__label__Support	What is edible, should be given to humans. What humans cannot eat, should be available for animals. What both cannot use, should go to biogas plants. The solid waste from biogas plants can be transformed into excellent compost. Runoff from biogas plants can be treated & provide H2. And the heat from biogas plants can provide heating or other forms of energy.

__label__Support	Extremely important thing for an informed decision of the citizens e.g. in the supermarket.
__label__Support	In order to be able to fight cross-border crime, Europol should have the same jurisdiction as the FBI in the US. It should focus on domestic EU cross-border crime fighting. It should have the autonomy to act without the intervention of local or national political influence.
__label__Attack	I think Europol should stay an association of regular National Police Departments and not be turned into anything else. However, I do support the creation of a European Criminal Investigations Office that will have full jurisdiction in the EU to investigate kidnappings and missing persons, cross-border and organized crime, terrorism threats, and digital crimes, and apprehend fugitives and suspects.
__label__Position	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy
__label__Attack	Fossil-sourced natural gas is as harmful as coal or oil. If it is sourced from fossil fuels, natural gas produces a net increase in CO2 in the atmosphere when burned.
__label__Attack	Some biofuels, such as soy, corn, sugar cane, rapeseed, and palm oil encourage deforestation
__label__Support	Refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course. When it comes to crimes, people are simply no longer worthy of protection and cannot be expelled because their actions show us that they neither accept nor respect our rules.
__label__Attack	All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified. Refugees/migrants are not to be expelled, certainly not immediately, but to be included in the employment problems and economic situation.
__label__Attack	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people. If we manage to be a welcoming continent, the people who come will thank us by being part of society.
__label__Position	We should end mandatory retirement
__label__Position	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition
__label__Support	A great idea because it definitely lowers the threshold.
__label__Support	It's high time that all broadcasting stations in the EU stimulate their journalists to cover European news as well.
__label__Support	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU
__label__Support	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to integrate people with different backgrounds within the institutions.
__label__Position	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Support	The more language communication skills around the closer we can get in this complicated world we live in. The fact it is a popular language around the world but not really recognized in Europe should change. I fully endorse its recognition in Europe.
__label__Support	Esperanto is a common language of citizens from all countries of the EU. Esperanto encounters bring them together for contact and understanding. The authorities of the European Union are called upon to support this direct communication of the citizens. It is our free choice in which language we want to talk to each other - please recognize and promote it!
__label__Support	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.
__label__Position	We should ban telemarketing
__label__Support	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex).
__label__Support	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.

__label__Position	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__Attack	if you want to save birds, you perhaps should think about domesticated cats and making modern buildings more bird-friendly. If you want to save insects, look at the way of land use and agriculture, and create insect-friendly gardens.
__label__Support	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.
__label__Support	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.

__label__Attack	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.
__label__Attack	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.
__label__Support	All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.
__label__Support	If the European Council listened to the results of the inquiry made by the European Commission. 'The EU was set to stop changing its clocks in 2021, but then came Brexit, the pandemic, and some messy international bureaucracy'.
__label__Support	Compulsory military training can also make people stronger physically &amp; emotionally.
__label__Attack	Most of the reserve force will not be utilized, which means huge amounts of expenditure on trainings will go in vain.
__label__Attack	Some people do not have enough strength to participate in such intense trainings. They may seem normal from outside but may have mental illnesses. Military trainings can be emotionally and physically daunting for them. In such cases compulsory trainings will be a threat to their life.
__label__Position	There should be centers of excellence in science and education
__label__Support	At present, most of the farmers in India are following chemical-based farming. But the food produced by excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can cause serious health problems when consumed. So, there is a need to address this, and Natural farming can be a solution to this.
__label__Support	Even though organic farming produces healthy and nutritious food, it produces greenhouse gases and thereby contributes to climate change. So, the best alternative is ZBNF.
__label__Support	With ZBNF, the government does not have to spend crores of rupees on loan waiver schemes.
__label__Support	The third agricultural revolution, which is also called as ‘Green revolution resulted in the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Chemical-based farming results in soil health deterioration, heavy water usage for crops, and high input costs. Organic farming was started as a solution to this. But it requires large amounts of manure & vermicompost. So, organic farming is quite expensive. But the Zero-Budget Natural Farming approach will require very fewer input costs and restores soil health and produces highly nutritious food.
__label__Attack	ZBNF is a cow-based farming practice. So ZBNF will result in an increase in the number of cows. But cows produce Methane, Nitrous Oxide & Ammonia, which are greenhouse gases and hence contribute to climate change. Methane is more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide, which is another greenhouse gas. Comparatively, methane is 25 times more powerful than Carbon dioxide. Nitrous Oxide is 300 more powerful than Carbon dioxide. And hence it is not a totally safe option.
__label__Attack	The name – ‘Zero Budget Natural Farming’ is confusing. If anyone hears the name for the first time, he/she will think that this approach requires no investment. But it requires investment to spend on labor, cow maintenance, and water. The costs are very low when compared with other forms of agriculture, but it is not completely zero. To avoid this confusion, ZBNF was renamed as Subhash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF). But, it was announced as ZBNF in the budget 2019.
__label__Support	We are witnessing farmer suicides in the past few years in several parts of the country. This is mainly because of the high input costs involved in farming. To raise capital, they are forced to take loans and if the crop fails due to various reasons, they are opting for suicide. Zero Budget Natural Farming will prevent farmers from getting trapped in a vicious cycle of debts.
__label__Attack	In the 1960s, the Green revolution increased food grain production with the aim of achieving food security and preventing famines. At present India’s population is increasing. So we need an abundant food supply. This may not be possible if we completely switch to natural farming.

__label__Support	homeopathy does not have enough research to prove it works. therefore people are potentially putting too much faith in something which will not work.
__label__Support	homeopathy is scientifically implausible and produces nothing more than a placebo effect in patients
__label__Support	one single fact that when somebody receiving homeopathy there is no quaranties that these substances will be good for the patient.
__label__Support	study of over 100 trials, which proves that homeopathic treatment doesn't work and is no better than placebo
__label__Support	homeopathy if not used correctly for many ailments could make them worse.
__label__Attack	Because most of its formulations are heavily diluted, most homeopathic treatments are safe
__label__Support	homeopathy causes harm because it is unregulated.
__label__Attack	in conjunction with medical care, it can give people hope
__label__Support	homeopathy has no scientific evidence of efficacy and is equivalent to simply taking no medical action at all.
__label__Attack	many people don't trust doctors and would rather take matters into their own hands; it's their body and they can try whatever homeopathic remedy they want
__label__Support	people believe it is helping when it is not
__label__Attack	natural medicine is safer and is proven to work as well as traditional medicine.
__label__Support	none of the products have been tested and some actually have very harmful effects.
__label__Support	when people use homeopathy instead of traditional medicines their health can suffer.
__label__Support	there are no proven scientific studies that can back up the positive effects of homeopathic remedies
__label__Attack	it is none of our business which treatment a person decides to pursue as long as there are no third party harms.
__label__Attack	homeopathy has been shown to help ease pain.
__label__Support	homeopathy has no scientific support
__label__Support	to rely on what is mostly water to bring health benefits is not benefiting anyone except the seller of the homeopathic 'medicine'.
__label__Support	someone with a serious life-threatening disease might put all their trust in homeopathy rather than using more proven medicine.
__label__Support	people that could have survived with proper medical attention but instead take the path of homeopathy to their detriment is a tragedy.
__label__Attack	homeopathy does not involve the use of addictive drugs
__label__Support	it's not proven that it actually works and might cause people who have problems to get worse.
__label__Attack	homeopathic remedies have been shown to be beneficial in many illnesses, reducing the length of the common cold
__label__Support	homeopathy is scientifically unproven and thus constitutes a health risk.
__label__Support	homeopathy doesn't have the same scientific backing as traditional medicine
__label__Attack	homeopathy is a great way to naturally cure or ease some ailments
__label__Attack	Homeopathy expands the field of medicine, creating more research and discourse.
__label__Attack	people should have options when in comes to their health. most people use homeopathy in conjunction with western medicines, and that should be their own decision and choice.
__label__Support	homeopathy is untested and not backed up by scientific evidence, allowing dangerous outcomes where unqualified practicioners can see vulnerable patients.
__label__Support	homeopathy creates the mindset that things such as vaccines can be replaced, which in turn can cause the death of others.
__label__Attack	everyone should be free to use any type of medicine to cure their illnesses - it is not for legislation to dictate what they should do , that would be a violation of their right to freedom.
__label__Attack	homeopathy is merely an alternative therapy, one people might seek as a less harsh, less dangerous alternative to standard medicine.
__label__Attack	when modern medicine avenues have been exhausted, it is a valuable alternative to keep hope many homeopathic medicines are effective and help the patient to stay positive, which is half the battle sometimes
__label__Attack	many people find symptomatic relief by using homeopathic remedies
__label__Support	Internet censorship helps in maintaining Cybersecurity.
__label__Support	Rapidly increasing piracy need to be curtailed through censorship.
__label__Position	We should reduce animal farming.
__label__Support	We should encourage people to consider the question: 'Do you think it is morally right to torture, mutilate, and kill animals needlessly?'
__label__Support	We can work together to encourage plant based diets and make the world a better place.

__label__Support	limiting the number of plastic types used for packaging will ease the process of its recycling
__label__Position	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good
__label__Attack	There are whole regions that are completely energy-autonomous with wind energy, solar power & biogas - not only in developing countries but in industrialized countries as well. It's not a question of technology, but just of mindset & innovative arrangement.
__label__Attack	Where energy costs for consumers are high in combination with renewables, it's mostly due to political decisions and market set-up, not due to technical issues. Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers.
__label__Position	We should put in place policies for the protection of insects
__label__Support	A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations, and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide.
__label__Support	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.
__label__Support	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.

__label__Support	It would force manufacturers to build longer-lasting products, and therefore reduce the impact on the environment and resources
__label__Support	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values. They bring crime, terror, and chaos. And after all, if there are no more Europeans in Europe, then what will happen to our beloved continent?
__label__Support	Illegal mass migration is a tragedy. Those who organize and direct mass migration are guilty of a crime against Humanity. Soros and Lukashenka are prime examples of such criminals.
__label__Position	MBAs do not make good business leaders
__label__Attack	The curriculum and the educational procedure in any MBA institutes lack hands-on practice over live projects in order to train them and give them a chance to work on their leadership skills. Instead of focussing on the technical aspects of business marketing, development of leadership along with interpersonal skills is extremely important.
__label__Support	MBA programs are the best in shaping personality and behavioural skills, which are the most essential qualities of leaders.
__label__Support	Learning everything by practice consumes time. Through MBA, we can learn management skills and skills to tackle real-life problems in businesses.
__label__Support	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.

__label__Support	Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!

__label__Position	We should implement minimum EU social standards
__label__Support	To reduce poverty and inequalities, the EU should develop a legal framework guaranteeing minimum social standards, including decent living and working conditions as well as adequate social protection.
__label__Support	The EU has “beautiful” ideas and is working on legislation for animal welfare and the environment. But as long as EU subsidies still support mass animal farms, all of this is not credible!
__label__Attack	India has already become a resource-scarce country. We are unable to deliver the basic necessities to genuine Indian citizens, and a large number of additional immigrants will further worsen the conditions. The efficient NRC will help us in identifying illegal immigrants and some steps that can be taken for their deportation.
__label__Attack	Curbing their voting rights can be beneficial to us. As it will avoid illegal immigrants from swinging elections in favor of those who promise them legitimacy.
__label__Attack	NRC sends a strong message that illegal immigrants are not welcome here.
__label__Support	The present process lacks impartiality, transparency, and equality. Updating or maintaining an NRC with such a huge population, and that too people with less income and low literacy is a very tedious task. And all efforts should be made to minimize injustice to anyone.
__label__Support	The NRC body and the Foreign Tribunals in Assam are functioning behind the curtains and its functioning is clearly signaling toward the ruling party’s agenda of getting rid of Minorities. Earlier retired judges were carefully selected for Foreign Tribunals but now any lawyer who is above 50 on 25 April 2015 and has 10 years of experience can volunteer for FT and gets a seat. Various online sources have reported that the FT is full of people sharing the ruling party’s ideology and are asked to perform well.
__label__Support	People are tired of showing their documents, and proving their identities but the Foreign Tribunals are never satisfied. Minor clerical mistakes have resulted in the listing of Indian citizens as Foreigners. At times FT has gone beyond scope of its power and ordered arrest, detention, revoked ration cards, etc. thus, troubling a poor Indian.
__label__Support	NRC increases the feeling of alienation among Muslims and animosity among orthodox Hindus, leading to communal unrest which is already on the rise since the BJP came to power.
__label__Support	With this faltering mechanism, already poor and helpless genuine Indians will lose their right to work, healthcare and education, and housing.
__label__Position	We should subsidize Wikipedia
__label__Support	A green initiative that I can endorse whole-heartedly. Rational environmentalism can save both our planet and our democracy (from the menace of the radical Greens).
__label__Position	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy
__label__Attack	Not all combustion engines use petrol as a fuel - natural gas engines are way more environment-friendly
__label__Attack	English is an international language and is spoken by most of Indians. So, if Hindi is made the national language, people who cannot speak Hindi will be at disadvantage in many things such as getting government jobs, understanding circulars, etc.
__label__Attack	Some people are arguing that English is not born in India and hence we should avoid using it. This statement lacks logic because all the technological innovations we are now using were born in different parts of the world. We cannot reject things just because they are not Indian.
__label__Support	English is not native to India, but Hindi is.
__label__Support	Hindi is spoken by more than half of India. As no single language is spoken by the entire of India, it is much better to make the majoritarian language the national language.
__label__Attack	Almost half of India’s mother tongue is not Hindi. There are 22 officially recognized regional languages in India. Making a majoritarian language the national language is unconstitutional.
__label__Support	Hindi is spoken by more than half of India. As no single language is spoken by entire India, it is much better to make the majoritarian language as the national language.
__label__Attack	There are widespread protests against the imposition of Hindi because non-Hindi speaking states are much more comfortable with English than Hindi.
__label__Attack	Some people are arguing that English is not born in India and hence we should avoid using it. This statement lacks logic because all the technological innovations we are now using were born in different parts of the world. We cannot reject things just because they are not Indian.
__label__Position	We need a better EU migration policy
__label__Position	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Position	Referendums are good for the society
__label__Support	It can be said that referendums are a direct form of democracy. As the people directly participate in the decision-making, avoiding any manipulation by their representatives.
__label__Attack	Referendums at times can lead to ill-informed decisions. Since the general public is politically inexperienced, they may not be able to gauge the long-term implications of their decisions.
__label__Attack	Referendums weaken the sovereignty of the parliament, where the decisions are made with thorough discussions and debate among the chosen representatives.
__label__Support	Referendums can educate citizens politically.
__label__Attack	Referendums provide an unreliable view, as the general public may have less knowledge about certain issues so they can be swayed in any direction by the politicians through aggressive speeches, false data, etc. And the lack of knowledge will leave no other choice for the people than to believe those facts.
__label__Support	Referendums force governments to do what the people actually want.
__label__Support	The common man has a say in policymaking as he will be the one living under the new set of rules, he will be the one who will be most affected. So, at times the priorities of people are different from the priorities of the government, referendums can set things straight.
__label__Position	The EU should reduce its influence on its member states.
__label__Position	International cooperation with third countries in the field of migration should be developed
__label__Support	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.

Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.
__label__Position	We should protect very large natural areas
__label__Support	To help achieve this, the EU should reduce its excessive livestock subsidies. An agricultural transition away from cattle towards plants would free up a lot of space
__label__Support	Very large natural areas need to be protected to promote wildlife and the return of self-sustaining and fertile biodiversity!
__label__Attack	Though the markets are yet a little controlled, they are freer than before. Consumerism improved the standard of living of the common Indian middle class tremendously. In recent decades, the Indian government has been improving the markets in order to boost entrepreneurial activity.
__label__Attack	The middle class benefited tremendously from consumerism. Increased job opportunities, wages, and cheaper goods helped raise their living standards tremendously. The new world order gave them hope that even they could have luxuries like the elite. Through business, they could climb up the social ladder.
__label__Attack	On the economic side, consumerism had a positive impact. Due to the increase in wages, people started buying more. Due to increased demand, aided by increased supply (due to the setting up of factories) entrepreneurial activity got a boost. Businesses were set up, jobs increased, wages improved and living standards improved. Overall, the world took a turn for the better. This made everyone look at consumerism (or for them, vanity) in a different light. Instead of being a stigma, it actually became a boon.
__label__Attack	Many people are dying of hunger in India. Hunger and malnutrition are the biggest problems India is facing right now. Beef is a cheap protein available to poor people. With the cattle slaughter ban, the malnutrition problem worsens further.
__label__Attack	70% of the cattle in India is owned by marginal farmers. They cannot afford to maintain their cattle after the cattle stop providing benefits to farmers, like providing milk, dung, etc. The only way for farmers is to sell these old animals to slaughterhouses.
__label__Support	The cow is a sacred animal for Hindus. Killing cows hurts their sentiments.
__label__Attack	It is not ethical to interfere with the food habits of others.
__label__Support	It is our responsibility to stop cruelty against animals. Article 48 of the Indian constitution mentions that the state should take steps in prohibiting the slaughter of cattle. Many slaughterhouses are still not following the rules to not harass the animals while killing. Animals are subjected to intense suffering at most slaughterhouses.
__label__Attack	Taking action against illegal slaughterhouses is the right step, but banning entire cattle slaughter may not be the right decision by the central government. There are food security and livelihood security issues. It is the responsibility of the government to respect everyone’s choices equally.
__label__Position	The EU needs s common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment
__label__Position	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act
__label__Position	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries
__label__Support	Subsidies for meat production and fishery not only have a negative impact on our environment - but they also destroy the economy in poorer countries in Africa! We really should find a way to stop these and get out of this vicious circle!
__label__Position	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID
__label__Attack	This can be a threat to privacy because this linking can lead to the profiling of voters. Several states collected caste, religion, and other sensitive information as part of aadhaar data collection. So, this can be misused by some politicians to selectively eliminate some voters based on their caste or any other identity.
__label__Attack	If legitimate voters do not have an aadhaar or if they could not link it due to any reason, they will be removed from the list. For example, some homeless people do not have aadhaar cards yet. In the 2018 Telangana Assembly elections, linking aadhaar cards with Voter ID led to the elimination of 20 lakh voters.
__label__Attack	There are fake and duplicate aadhaar cards too. So, linking aadhaar cards with voter IDs may complicate the issue.
__label__Support	This can be used to eliminate fake voter cards. Moreover, some people have voter cards in 2 or more areas. These duplicate voter cards can be eliminated by linking Aadhaar cards with Voter IDs.
__label__Support	This linking can clear the path to internet voting or e-voting.
__label__Position	The EU should promote organizations that teach the national language via Esperanto
__label__Attack	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.
__label__Position	Homeschooling should be encouraged in India
__label__Position	We should legalize non-violent drug use
__label__Support	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime!
__label__Support	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.
__label__Support	European institutions should take factual studies of the relative harm of different drugs into account. A UK study has shown that drugs such as cannabis and many hallucinogenic drugs are far less harmful than alcohol. The study in question was conducted by David J Nutt, Leslie A King, Lawrence D Phillips, on behalf of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs
__label__Position	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
__label__Position	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens
__label__Attack	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.
__label__Position	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists
__label__Position	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
__label__Position	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy
__label__Attack	In the case of nuclear power, cooling is needed to prevent a meltdown. And if water is not available because of drought or freezing, earthquake or tsunami, etc, these gigantic steam engines have to be shut down, otherwise, they will produce highly hazardous outcomes.
__label__Position	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal
__label__Attack	If you want to do it for nuclear power, then it would be better to do it for every single kind of energy production methods. It’s also important then to include the complete cycle of all the energies, the human cost, the extraction of primary resources, in the case of renewable energy, take into account the necessary energy storage, and so on and so forth.
__label__Position	We should subsidize stay-at-home dads
__label__Position	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable
__label__Support	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. They are internationally recognized & very precise. As far as I know, all or most countries have agreed on these goals. The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details.
__label__Support	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.
__label__Support	Glass is one of the biggest causes of human death for birds.

__label__Support	social media can be incredibly addicting and cause depression based on popularity contests. we shouldn't use it so much because it can cause suicide and cyber bullying.
__label__Support	social media brings more harm than good because it causes people to judge themselves too harshly in comparison of the seemingly perfect lives of others online.

__label__Support	social media is dangerous and out of control.
__label__Support	social media provides an easy way for people to bully others without having to face the person they are bullying.

__label__Attack	social media has brought a democratization of media to all those who are able to access it, allowing rapid discemination of news and protest groups to further their causes.

__label__Attack	social media allows friends and family to stay in contact a lot easier.
__label__Attack	social media is great because it can connect people across the globe. it was never before possible to have a live face to face conversation with someone than we can now with social media video apps.

__label__Support	social media can help to foster radicalism & extremism
__label__Support	social media can be detrimental to mental health as it can lead to inaccurate ideas about other people's lives. this is because people will often post the best parts of their lives.

__label__Attack	hamas is too dangerous to allow in & the blockade should continue
__label__Attack	the blockade of the gaza strip keeps more arms from entering through there which in turn saves lives.
__label__Support	the blockade makes it harder for the people in that area to make money, and their economy is on the verge of collapse according to world bank.
__label__Support	The blockade makes smuggling more profitable which is often linked to terrorist groups and is used to fund terrorist organizations.
__label__Support	While Israel is justified in its claims of self-defense against Hamas and other organizations that have used violence against the state, the response to this violence in the blockade is massively disproportionate and therefore unjustified.
__label__Support	blockade of the gaza strip is morally wrong.
__label__Support	Since the blockade began, it has failed to decrease Hamas activity or violence against Israel in any meaningful way, failing at its main objective.
__label__Support	the blockade of the gaza strip has gone on way too long and should be ended, this is not the united states fight.
__label__Support	blockading the gaza strip is no longer useful and those doing it could better serve elsewhere.
__label__Support	ending the gaza strip blockade would allow more freedom of movement of people and goods which may allow a better standard of living for the gazan people.
__label__Attack	Humanitarian arguments against the blockade are overblown, as the blockade is not designed to prevent things like food and medicine from entering Gaza, but rather weapons and other resources that may assist Hamas.
__label__Support	Caste divisions are hatred among communities is increasing due to reservations. Many communities in several states of India are fighting to give them reservations. And the consequence is people are increasingly associating with their caste. The interesting fact is that before the first caste census by British government (1881) in India, many people do not even know what their caste is. From then, the idea of caste is deeply ingrained in the Indian society. Now the reservations are making the situation even worse.
__label__Attack	In India, it's easy to hide some income resources and to get a false income certificate. Though the situations are changing for the better, it is not that difficult.
__label__Position	We should not produce unnecessary garbage
__label__Support	Things that are supposed to serve us for a long time, like a vehicle or telecommunication device or household implements should be designed to last half a lifetime under normal use. The quality of the building material should matter more in that instance, so less focus on recycling.
__label__Support	Things that are one-time use only, like most packaging and the like, should be radically focused on recycling potential.
__label__Support	EU must take action. Help those in need, but only those who respect legal boundaries. Mutual respect is a cornerstone in this subject where we must set limits to protect Europe.

__label__Position	We do not need any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Position	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
__label__Support	Currently the ETS only applies to certain carbon-emitting industries covering 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. To effectively combat climate change 40% is not enough. That is why the ETS has to be expanded to at least cover agriculture and transport as well. In Addition to the extension of the ETS the subsidies in fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) must be cut in the near future.
__label__Position	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Support	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border.

__label__Support	Wood should be used as building material & other meaningful products only. Anything else is a waste of resources. No fresh wood for paper, fast furniture
__label__Support	The traditional family is the cornerstone of European civilization.
__label__Support	The family is people's foundation and it rests on it all their lives and work, and this needs to be valued.
__label__Position	The European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity.
__label__Support	wind and solar power sources are inherently non-controllable and destroy our landscapes and natural environment, with their multiple harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects.
__label__Support	Nuclear energy is undoubtedly the best form of electricity production, massive and controllable, with no CO2/GHG emissions.
__label__Position	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.
__label__Position	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.
__label__Support	I am concerned about the source of some cotton, which is produced in Chinese detention camps. A unified EU mark of ethical & environmental principles would be a nice thing to have when deciding what to buy.
__label__Support	The vast majority of the victims of this genocide in China are Muslims. And yet, the Muslim countries see the USA and the West as their arch-enemies!
__label__Attack	Sounds a little xenophobic. There is no concept of indigenous or aborigenous population in Europe, the only criteria is citizenship.
__label__Support	European Union has already forgotten for example about the Ingrian Finnish indigenous nation. We have our own unique flag, our own unique language (that only about 1300 people speak in the entire world), our own land that the Ingrian Finnish lived on before Russia took over Karelia and sent them all to labor work in Siberia, Karelian forests and Estonia.
__label__Position	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism.
__label__Position	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism
__label__Support	Pushbacks may not be a nice way of operating. However, Brussels is causing problems by telling the whole World that everyone (7 billion people) has the right to apply for asylum in the EU. It would be much better by refusing admission to anyone appearing at the border without papers. The experience is that over 80% of the immigrants are not refugees in danger.
__label__Support	We need to legalize pushbacks as a tool to limit illegal migration.
__label__Position	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources
__label__Support	'People highlight various risks, but any generation technology comes with risks: the largest electricity-related disaster (Banquiao dam in 1976) took the lives of 200000 people (!) or just recently 70 people in Russia, but nobody talks about hydropower being 'deadly' or complaining about states providing insurance for such massive projects, because it happens for all projects of such scale.
__label__Support	There is no generation technology that comes with zero risks, and this is why we need to look at objective scientific indicators.
__label__Support	In the UK since 2015, there were over 80 PV-related fires, at least 1/4 of which were actually solar panels catching fire, releasing toxic smoke, and contaminating the ground with cadmium.
__label__Attack	Limiting freedom of movement does not seem like a good idea to me. I think what you are experiencing is bad local management, with urban planning laws fast growth and traffic issues can be fixed and avoided altogether.
__label__Position	We should stop making one-cent coins
__label__Support	The convenience of carrying fewer coins is obvious.
__label__Support	A one-cent coin costs about 60% more to produce than it is actually worth.
__label__Attack	So to support European citizens you want to take more money from them?
__label__Support	Having many individuals in the EU paying a voluntary tax can contribute big time to the perceived democratic legitimacy of the EU.
__label__Support	Tax should be compulsory, not voluntary! Yes, the EU needs to collect direct taxes! For example, taxes on companies, and green taxes (tax on non-recycled items, tax on carbon, etc), as all should be harmonized across the EU.
__label__Support	The money from this could be allocated to pan-European projects, new citizen services, etc, tangible and prestigious results that may prompt others to join in.
__label__Position	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity
__label__Position	There should be a European Common Defence and Security Alliance
__label__Position	We need Integrated migration and border policy.
__label__Position	We should establish a Russian interest including EU policy.
__label__Position	Nuclear disarmament is necessary
__label__Support	Experts have been discussing that the two major threats in front of us are Climate Change and Nuclear Weapons. And they have been urging for complete disarmament. To some extent they are right. When a nuclear bomb will explode the surface will become hotter than the sun and apart from the mass destruction and deaths, the generations of people and animals who survive will perish for many decades. Reports say that almost 2000 nuclear weapons are kept on high alert throughout the year. Any misunderstanding or miscommunication can lead to a disaster, and with the impulsive leadership we are seeing around the world possibilities are higher than before. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the symbolic Doomsday Clock by 30 seconds in February, which indicates how world leaders are failing in maintaining peace.
__label__Support	Several terrorist organizations are also trying very hard to obtain nuclear weapons. Now if by any chance they get nuclear arms there we can’t even imagine the destruction.
__label__Support	All the countries do not have very high security for their nuclear arms, apart from going into the wrong hands the system that controls them can also be hacked.
__label__Attack	Nuclear weapons are extremely lethal and can wipe out life on the Earth, and have actually worked as a deterrence to full-scale wars. We have seen two world wars, and the second one came to an end with a nuclear bomb being dropped by the USA on Japan. Since then, we haven’t seen any open, full-fledged wars, not because there have been no tensions among the countries and we all are living happily, but because of the reason that most of the developed and developing countries have nuclear arms.
__label__Position	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from
__label__Position	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society.
__label__Attack	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.
__label__Attack	National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success. We need to be united, aligned, and, above all, independent from any extra-EU hegemon!
__label__Support	In this case, the service generates profit, not the product.
__label__Support	All this lengthens the life cycle of a product and reduces waste.
__label__Position	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees
__label__Attack	As per Gandhiji's words "An Eye for an Eye leaves the whole world Blind", bullet for bullet is not a right policy.
__label__Support	If we keep on forgiving the terrorists, terrorism will not be eliminated.
__label__Position	Men are silent sufferers in this modern world
__label__Position	Migrants should not be used for political blackmail.
__label__Attack	Natural materials have a large carbon footprint. They require fresh water and land, contributing to the pressure on nature and resources around the world.
__label__Position	We should change our consumption habits
__label__Position	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration.
__label__Support	Islam represents the biggest threat to democracy in the EU since it’s not compatible with European values. Islam, it’s not only a religion but almost a constitution which trying to impose on European society.
__label__Support	EU leaders continue their naive policy of hosting millions of migrants from Muslim countries without taking into consideration the inability to integrate into society even after many generations, and the fact that the Muslim diaspora is controlled by their countries of origin, the most flagrant example is the interference of Turkey and its dictator Erdogan in the German elections calling the Turkish diaspora to boycott this election since none of the candidates please him.
__label__Support	Evil historic practices on women in the pre and post medieval period have been into oblivion. Practices like child marriages, polygamy, ban on remarriages, honor killings, Sati, Jauhar and Purdah are obsolete in today's world. With time, more such practices are being redundant and thus, increasing safety measures.
__label__Support	Women of our country have been and are achieving the epitomes of success and glory every other day. Prominent personalities like Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Sarla Thakral, Kalpana Chawla, Sister Nivedita, Sarojini Naidu, and many more have been conquering their respective fields for centuries. In recent times, Prativa Patil, Meira Kumar, Priyanka N., Mitali Madhumita, Tanushree Pareek are some of the women achievers to be the queens. With such accomplishments happening around, safety can be guaranteed to a big extent.
__label__Attack	The National Crime Records Bureau states that happenings of crimes against women have risen from 273 per day in 2001 to 313 per day in 2015. This is not a good sign in terms of safety in India.
__label__Position	Solar and wind energies have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects
__label__Position	There should be no illegal migration.
__label__Position	There should be a European Army.
__label__Position	News channels are breaking rules to give Breaking news
__label__Position	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities
__label__Support	The bicycle should be the main mode of transport for a majority of citizens because it is faster, it is easier, it is healthier, it is cheaper, it is more convenient, and it is eco-friendly.
__label__Support	Having cycling and micromobility as primary modes also makes cities quieter, less congested, less polluted, safer, and simply more pleasant and liveable, particularly for children.
__label__Attack	intelligence tests should continue to be used because they provide valuable data
__label__Support	some people are highly intelligent but don't do well on testing so intelligence tests can't measure a true value if it's only testing with one method.
__label__Support	intelligence tests can prevent someone from pursuing their passion which they may be able to achieve with hard work
__label__Attack	intelligence tests help teachers and other school staff identify in where a student, or a whole group, is deficient.
__label__Support	intelligence test can cause certain students to be pigeon holed and cause them to have low opinions of themselves because they can not score as high as others.
__label__Attack	iq tests are great for determining how smart a person is. this not only helps with getting into colleges and jobs but a person with a low iq can show that they are a prime candidate for public assistance.
__label__Support	intelligence tests don't determine someone's real intellect. that is shown in their everyday lives.
__label__Support	intelligence tests don't accurately measure intelligence because they are inherently biased towards the type of people who designed them
__label__Attack	intelligence tests are there to recognize kids who are smarter and to be given proper chance.
__label__Support	IQ tests can make test-takers discouraged if they receive a bad score. They may not make an effort to succeed, since they already expect to fail.
__label__Support	it is often difficult to use a standard IQ test to measure the capabilities of people who communicate in a non-standard way
__label__Support	intelligence tests unfairly punish intelligent people who are not good test takers.
__label__Support	it does because it is a test that cant cover a persons full knowledge or personality and may brand someone smart when they're not or stupid when they are smart andit could have a major impact on the person.
__label__Support	Intelligence tests bring more harm than good because they undermine self esteem for children with lower scores than their classmates.
__label__Support	Intelligence tests have been a tool used by Eugenicists to argue for the culling of certain racial and ethnic groups.
__label__Attack	intelligence tests are just another tool for teachers to use
__label__Attack	intelligence tests help to determine if a person is in need of intellectual help
__label__Support	intelligence tests can generate stress and cause poor performance of the individual because it consists of a comparison of their intellectual capacity with others
__label__Support	Testing anxiety can bias the results, leading to inaccurate results.
__label__Support	intelligence tests are really not so much about intelligence but about the ability to take a test so, of course, it does more harm than good in that it will label people wrongly based on their test-taking.
__label__Support	people that do well at intelligence tests are the ones supporting it, causing inequality in their favor, instead of using other empirically valid test.
__label__Attack	intelligence tests allow an unbiased mechanism to get extra resources to those that have a higher capacity for learning yet lack the economic mobility to receive these resources.
__label__Attack	intelligence tests can help specify a persons abilities allowing them to develop their skill and knowledge of a specific capability.
__label__Attack	intelligence tests are a way to get a good idea of how smart someone is, even if the results aren't necessarily 100% accurate they give a good base to judge people on.
__label__Support	it gives people a feeling of superiority over others. some people are just not good test takers, it doesn't mean they aren't intelligent.
__label__Support	People possess many different forms of I Q, from logical IQ to emotional IQ and that might not always be highlighted in standard IQ tests
__label__Support	intelligence tests will cause children with alternative learning styles to fall through the cracks in the educational system.
__label__Support	intelligence test give some people a false sense of superiority and others a feeling of failure. the test does not tell how successful a person will be and their ability to function in the real world.
__label__Support	intelligence tests bring more harm than good because it will give people low self esteem if they get a low score on the test
__label__Attack	intelligence tests give confidence to those placed behind their level
__label__Support	intelligence tests are unscientific and only give a narrow, limited view of ones skills and abilities
__label__Support	some people are very intelligent but have a difficult time when it comes to taking tests. therefore they could be labeled as less intelligent as they really are.
__label__Attack	intelligence tests often help children excel by allowing them to be placed in appropriate classes or programs based on their individual abilities.
__label__Attack	Intelligence tests can help to identify struggling or gifted students so that educators can accommodate to each individuals needs.
__label__Attack	I.Q. tests provide genuine insight into an individual's capabilities
__label__Attack	intelligence tests are important for differentiating instruction for students that need it.
__label__Support	I.Q. tests are much too narrow and potentially dangerous if relied on to classify people
__label__Support	intelligence tests limit the possibilities because they are not able to show potential, just current knowledge.
__label__Attack	intelligence test help students end up in classes that help them learn the best.
__label__Support	intelligence tests bring more harm than good by focusing on strengths and weaknesses.
__label__Attack	intelligence test are a cheap, easy option to sieve through a crowd and people should not take offence to that
__label__Support	the branding of a child by intelligence tests at an early age can cause grave damage, all for no proven education benefit.
__label__Support	intelligence tests are skewed toward upper class white males, making the test not a true measure of a person's intelligence
__label__Support	intelligence tests bring more harm than good since not all intelligence can be tested, for instance, one could be gifted socially and this cannot be tested.
__label__Attack	I.Q. testing allows students to understand and focus on their intellectual strengths
__label__Attack	intelligence tests bring less harm than good because the envelope of people
__label__Support	intelligence test are not fully accurate.
__label__Support	intelligence tests seek to rank people based on an arbitrary test. it hurts the self esteem of people that probably have proficiency in a different type of intelligence that the test tests.
__label__Support	intelligence tests bring more harm than good because people can get competitive over them which can lead to isolation.
__label__Support	Children identified as "slow" or "learning disabled" are often put in special classes with lighter workloads, teachers expect less of them, and they end up far behind their peers.
__label__Support	a bad score in an intelligence test is a blow to people sense of worth, hurting not only their feeling's but also this society's development.
__label__Attack	IQ tests allow teachers and parents to direct additional resources to children who need them the most, i.e., those with low IQ scores.
__label__Attack	Intelligence tests allow employers and schools to locate areas where test takers need to improve.

__label__Support	measuring human intelligence based only on a standard iq test is highly deceptive
__label__Attack	intelligence tests are useful tools for schools and employers.
__label__Support	Cheating is rampant among wealthy students taking standardized tests for college.
__label__Attack	i contest because the founding of each children's iq benefit them actually so parents or educators can proper put these kids in a design classroom or seek extra help to tackle their specific weaknesses
__label__Attack	IQ tests allows students to understand and focus on their intellectual strengths.
__label__Support	IQ tests measure only a few types of cognitive abilities and do not account for the vast array of intelligence types
__label__Support	intelligence tests can do more harm than good because it labels the takers as gifted or failure and don't cover other forms of intelligence.
__label__Support	a person can be gifted musically, intrapersonally or kinetically in ways that are just as important as verbal or mathematical skill and these other types of intelligence are not easily measured by any test yet produced
__label__Attack	the use of intelligence tests allows the identification of children who need extra help with their education
__label__Attack	Intelligence tests create a discourse about different forms of education and how they can be measured.
__label__Support	intelligence tests put the focus at that immediate time of taking the test of whether a person can cope with being under pressure while taking a test, therefore, detrimental.

__label__Attack	intelligence tests have been known to help students be comfortable learning and studying among their peers based on aptitude
__label__Attack	intelligence tests are very useful to determine who needs extra help in core learning and who can be pushed to excel, meaning both high and low scorers are more equipped to reach their full potential.
__label__Support	these tests need to be stopped until they are able to properly assess intelligence in a variety of forms, currently they are discriminatory

__label__Position	We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines
__label__Attack	Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions. Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe. The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable!

__label__Attack	surrogacy is the only way some couples can have a family so should not be banned.
__label__Attack	surrogacy is a way for couples that are otherwise infertile to have children.
__label__Support	this is too dangerous for the parents to be. often the surrogate mother changes her mind.
__label__Attack	surrogacy gives those who can't have children a way to have them.
__label__Support	surrogacy is just another term for baby selling which is against the law.
__label__Attack	surrogacy should not be banned because it benefit women or couples that cannot get pregnant themselves
__label__Support	surrogacy creates a host of complicated issues around parental rights.
__label__Attack	surrogacy is the answer to prayers for many couples who cannot have their own child, the gift of a baby by the surrogate is the ultimate gift, the chance of a family.
__label__Support	surrogacy is an artificial means of creating more children. if a person can not have children then they should adopt since there are many children that need parents.

__label__Attack	This is a huge discrimination. Everyone should have the chance to develop to a personal level. Or should we all do an IQ-test to stay in our country? Because it could avoid dangerous things like rasicm.
__label__Attack	Some of the 9/11 Terrorists were well educated. IQ proves nothing, I'd better welcome good people than smart people.
__label__Attack	People from several countries are asking for asylum in Europe in hope of better life conditions. Those people aren’t guilty for being born in those countries and EU should support everyone.
__label__Attack	This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.
__label__Attack	IQ is not an effective measure of whether they'll be economically beneficial, suited to European jobs in high demand, likely to integrate/assimilate, their potential to cause crime etc.
__label__Attack	This just seems like an overtly emotional suggestion that isn't too well thought out. It would cause far more problems that it solves.

People should move into such jobs. For the manual work - there are robots coming. We should not try to distort market forces and stop development.

__label__Position	WikiLeaks is not a bane
__label__Attack	Please consider this: right now in Africa several million people are half starved, and eat a meal a day at best. They live thanks to cheap agricultural products coming from Europe, because local stuff is too expensive for them.
__label__Attack	It will take years before the local farmers will be able to give well paid jobs to the local workers. In the meantime you'll have a famine and a genocide. And I didn't even mention the effects of a sudden huge inflation wave.

__label__Position	We should promote the use of nuclear energy
__label__Attack	We should never ever allow any nuclear power after Fukushima!
__label__Support	nuclear power plants which, compared to fossil fuel-fired power plants, have decreased carbon dioxide emissions and produce incomparably less toxic substances, which, moreover, are not emitted into the air we breathe, but can be buried deep underground where they will not harm anyone.
__label__Attack	At this stage it is not worth investing money in current nuclear technology, what we should be doing is investing more in research into nuclear fusion energy, which is really the clean and safe energy we need and which we are getting closer and closer to achieving, in order to have those artificial suns working as soon as possible.
__label__Attack	Renewable energies should be our focus of action, especially how to improve the storage and transport of this energy precisely in order to be able to supply the countries that have the worst conditions to implement them.
__label__Support	Europe must be a place that follows science, and following science nuclear power is an important tool in our fight against climate change.
__label__Support	Worldwide, nuclear power has prevented emissions of 240 billion tonnes of CO2 and prevented 1.8 million lives due to prevented air pollution (Kharecha, Hansen 2013).
__label__Support	Nuclear power is safe - there are over 400 nuclear power plants globally, most of which have operated with no issues for the last 40 years, providing 24/7 electricity and preventing pollution and CO2 emissions. In terms of safety, including all accidents and pollution, nuclear power has caused 0.07 deaths/TWh, which is 40x less than natural gas and comparable with wind power (OurWorldInData 2021).
__label__Support	Nuclear power takes little space, and unlike wind and solar works 24/7 and 7 years to build on average.
__label__Attack	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable.
__label__Attack	We are still living in a capitalism, so, the price will decide and the price of nuclear energy is the only energy price which is increasing steadily, while renewables become cheaper every year. Nuclear was always only subsidiesed by governments and never really standing on their own. The building process is slow, the price is high, no way, this could be a gain - if it weren't for the military.

__label__Attack	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.
__label__Attack	Halting all immigration to EU from non-European or non-first-world countries will lead to an even more competitive advantage for the USA and other countries as our population is shrinking rapidly.

__label__Attack	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work! What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights

__label__Support	Vehicular pollution is one of the major causes of air pollution. By switching to Electric vehicles, we can solve this issue. As per the report by the government, with this move, carbon emissions will be reduced by 37% by the year 2030. This will also help in our fight against climate change. As India is committed to bringing down its share of global emissions by 2030 as per the Paris climate agreement, replacing diesel and petrol vehicles with electric vehicles will help us in achieving this goal.
__label__Support	As the number of people who are buying vehicles is rising, the air quality will worsen further. So, there is a need to address this challenge.
__label__Support	As of 2019, India is importing crude oil for 82% of its oil requirement. By using electric vehicles, we can reduce the dependence on other countries for oil imports.

__label__Support	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals. It would be good for every person to be given psychotherapeutic advice once a year in order to be able to diagnose and treat mental disorders and illnesses at an early stage or even to prevent them.
__label__Support	A psychological examination should be part of child screening, together with counseling to parents (e.g. dealing with children’s own concerns and fears, or increasing self-confidence among children and parents). It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognize them in the home and learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health.

__label__Attack	public defenders are overworked and already with a low salary, thus they may not be that beneficial.
__label__Attack	this would cause a decrease in pay for the public defender and lower the quality of representation as too many people will rush to the new employment opportunities regardless of their record..

__label__Attack	public defenders should not be mandatory because it will affect peoples cases since they can physical tell them your story

__label__Attack	a lawyer would provide better representation for his client than a public defender who gets paid a lot less

__label__Attack	The age of 18 years is considered a legal adult in India. They have voting rights too. But not giving them the right to marry the partner of their choice may work against their rights. In 2018, the Law Commission recommended lowering the minimum legal age of men from 21 to 18 years and suggested keeping both genders’ minimum legal age for marriage as 18 years.
__label__Support	At present, many girls are forced to drop out of studies for marriage. So, making the minimum legal age for marriage 21 will allow them to continue their studies. Thereby, many more women will go for higher education.
__label__Support	Teenage pregnancies increase the risk of high blood pressure, anemia, and several other health problems. It can also lead to the death of the mother due to pregnancy complications. So, raising the age of marriage for girls can reduce the chance of maternal mortality.
__label__Support	Early marriages result in several mental health issues in many girls. So, this move can eliminate this problem.
__label__Support	As several girls are married at 18 years, they are not having financial independence. This is resulting in dependence on their husbands for survival. The dependence will force them to stay in the relationship even if it is abusive. So, raising the minimum legal age for marriage can empower women and can help them in achieving financial independence before marriage.
__label__Attack	As per the government data of 2017, the average age of marriage for women is increased to 22.1 years. So, the change is voluntary. The change was mainly due to the improving education among women. So, the solution lies in encouraging education for girls, conducting awareness programs on the importance of education, financial independence and the consequences of teenage pregnancies should be conducted instead of passing a law to bring a real change in society.
__label__Attack	At present, child marriages are happening throughout India even after ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, of 2006’. As per the National Family Health Survey (2019-2021), 1/4th of the women aged 20-24 years were married before attaining the age of 18 years. After the pandemic, the number of child marriages increased significantly. So, the problem lies in the implementation. Hence the law alone cannot bring a change in society without proper implementation. Root causes should be addressed before bringing a law.
__label__Attack	Several girls are being forced into marriages due to the patriarchal mindset of their families. Until now, many girls of such families rebelled against such forced marriages and married the person of their choice after attaining 18 years with the help of legal support. But now, they have to wait till attaining 21 years. This will be misused by patriarchal families to threaten and control them.

__label__Position	We should limit the use of fireworks
__label__Support	I have also seen ex-soldiers shaking after someone sets off loud fireworks. Yes they should be banned. Abhorrent things.
__label__Support	All animals from dogs, cats, birds, cows, pigs, and horses (the list is long) suffer from human use of fireworks! The high bursts and flashes cause anxiety in the body.
__label__Support	Fireworks are an especially selfish source of entertainment.
__label__Position	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools
__label__Support	Makes sense to me, its easy to learn and doesn't come with any nationalist baggage.
__label__Support	EU lacks a common language for its citizens, which would be easy to manage for all citizens and strengthen a sense of belonging, a common European identity while preserving their national identities.
__label__Attack	I can't endorse this. Esperanto isn't neutral. It favors Spanish speakers. Meanwhile, Slavic speakers are at a disadvantage. So why not one of the Slavic artificial languages?
__label__Support	Esperanto can be a new tool for a more united European Union.
__label__Attack	Europeans must embrace true values that enhance life and standards of living. Anything related to drugs, in whatever form, degenerates humanity. Soon enough we will be legalizing 'theft' in an effort to improve GDP and growth, as European colonialists have done in Africa and Asia where oppression and exploitation ruled.
__label__Support	The European Parliament is in dire need of reform. It has become a circus, where the MEPs engage in wild ideological posturing without substance. The EP's function is to address the pressing needs of EU citizens, but it hasn't done that for ages. One possible solution could be to replace it with a legislative body that is made up of delegates from member state parliaments.
__label__Support	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution. It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament.
__label__Support	The Russians use the money we give them in exchange for gas to spread disinformation, and propaganda and finance the terrorists in the Donbas and its mercenaries (Wagner Group) in Libya.
__label__Support	The cost of gas will be higher. But I prefer to pay a little more for the gas bill than to finance Putin’s malicious activities.
__label__Support	Investing in R&D will create an incentive system for businesses to start with green solutions.
__label__Support	Agrivoltaic could be a perfect model for an energy cooperation of citizens to own some greenhouses with photovoltaic & rent them for a small fee to a urban gardening cooperation of citizens, for example.
__label__Attack	Subsidizing big agricultural companies is not the problem here, it's the criteria by which the subsidies are distributed.
__label__Support	Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are by far the most important neighbors of the EU. A good relationship with all three is very desirable for the EU. For that, we would have to be willing to understand their history better.
__label__Support	The Russian Federation is our neighbor. We share common historic and cultural ties with them. Today the EU confronts Russia with sanctions. An understandable reaction to its actions in Ukraine and failing democracy. Let us not forget actions done by others (US intervention in Iraq, the Chinese in Tibet and their treatment of minorities, etc.). Yet we close our eyes.
__label__Support	Russia is troublesome with its own agenda and unconventional methods. Perhaps due to a heritage of a system, that is no longer the norm today. Remember, they fought next to us and Russians merit our hand reaching out to them. A policy change to show empathy, foster closer economic ties, and build on bilateral projects and partnerships in various cultural, scientific, trade, or economic programs.
__label__Support	Including Russia in our sphere of friendship would allow the EU to discuss certain values from within and coax them toward democracy and change. Economic partnerships can act as leverage. Friendly ties, in time, will bring common views to prevail.
__label__Support	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.).
__label__Support	Many people, even in the richest European countries, work hard, work overtime or have several jobs & cannot sustain themselves. That's humiliating, time-consuming alien to physical & mental health, and poisoning society.
__label__Support	Nations that have adopted living wages for full-time jobs have highly profited from that step. It's been an economic booster because if people who earn & possess little can afford what they need, they will buy. So they increase demand. Demand increases supply. More supply means more jobs, more suppliers, lower costs, etc.
